In a post on his social media platform X, the world's richest man thanked Trump for the opportunity to help run the Department of Government Efficiency, known as Doge. 
The White House began ""offboarding"" Musk as a special government employee on Wednesday night, the BBC understands.
His role was temporary and his exit is not unexpected, but it comes a day after Musk criticised the legislative centrepiece of Trump's agenda.
""As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,"" Musk wrote on X. 
""The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.""
The South African-born tech tycoon had been designated as a ""special government employee"" - allowing him to work a federal job for 130 days each year. 
What is Doge and why is Musk leaving?
How much has Elon Musk's Doge cut?
Who is Musk and what is his net worth?
Measured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, he would hit that limit towards the end of May.  
But his departure comes a day after he said he was ""disappointed"" with Trump's budget bill, which proposes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a boost to defence spending. 
The SpaceX and Tesla boss said in an interview with BBC's US partner CBS that the ""big, beautiful bill"", as Trump calls it, would increase the federal deficit.
Musk also said he thought it ""undermines the work"" of Doge. 
""I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,"" Musk said. ""But I don't know if it could be both.""
Musk, who had clashed in private with some Trump cabinet-level officials, initially pledged to cut ""at least $2 trillion"" from the federal government budget, before halving this target, then reducing it to $150bn.
An estimated 260,000 out of the 2.3 million-strong federal civilian workforce have had their jobs cut or accepted redundancy deals as a result of Doge.
In some cases, federal judges blocked the mass firings and ordered terminated employees to be reinstated.
The rapid-fire approach to cutting the federal workforce occasionally led to some workers mistakenly being let go, including staff at the US nuclear programme.
Musk announced in late April that he would step back to run his companies again after becoming a lightning rod for criticism of Trump's efforts to shake up Washington.
""Doge is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,"" Musk told the Washington Post in Texas on Tuesday ahead of a Space X launch.
""Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.""
Musk's time in government overlapped with a significant decline in sales at his electric car company. 
Tesla sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of this year, the largest drop in deliveries in its history.
The company's stock price also tumbled by as much as 45%, but has mostly rebounded and is only down 10%.
Tesla recently warned investors that the financial pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles.
Musk told investors on an earnings call last month that the time he allocates to Doge ""will drop significantly"" and that he would be ""allocating far more of my time to Tesla"".
Activists have called for Tesla boycotts, staging protests outside Tesla dealerships, and vandalising the vehicles and charging stations.
The Tesla blowback became so violent and widespread that US Attorney General Pam Bondi warned her office would treat acts of vandalism as ""domestic terrorism"".
Speaking at an economic forum in Doha, Qatar, on Tuesday, Musk said he was committed to being the leader of Tesla for the next five years. 
He said earlier this month he would cut back his political donations after spending nearly $300m to back Trump's presidential campaign and other Republicans last year."

A South African woman convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her six-year-old daughter has been sentenced to life in prison, along with her two accomplices.
The jail terms for Racquel ""Kelly"" Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn come more than a year after Joshlin Smith mysteriously disappeared outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town.
Despite a highly publicised search for the girl, who vanished in February 2024, she is yet to be found.
South African prosecutors say she was sold into slavery however this was not definitively proven during the trial.
It is believed that Smith, who was addicted to drugs, needed the money.
The sentencing follows an eight-week trial that captivated South Africa, with witnesses and prosecutors making a number of shocking allegations.
Judge Nathan Erasmus said he ""drew no distinction"" between the trio in handing down the sentences. 
""On the human trafficking charge, you are sentenced to life imprisonment. On the kidnapping charge, you are sentenced to 10 years imprisonment,"" he said to loud applause in the courtroom. 
Kelly Smith refused to testify in the six-week trial
Judge Erasmus took over an hour to deliver the sentence and was measured as he gave a brief summary of the case and highlighted points that stood out during the trial.
He rebuked the trio, especially Van Rhyn and Smith, saying they showed no remorse for their actions.
""There is nothing that I can find that is redeeming or deserving of a lesser sentence,"" he said.
He also spoke of the impact their conduct had on the community of Middelpos, where the girl lived, saying it had left residents ""fractured"".
Smith, 35, and her accomplices showed no emotion as their sentences were read out in the community centre in Saldanha where the trial was held to allow residents to attend proceedings.
Tears and heartbreak over tragic story of Joshlin Smith
South Africa police target gang kidnapping women in shopping centres
Police said the search for the little girl would continue, even beyond South Africa's borders.
""We will not rest until we find [out] what happened to Joshlin. We are continuing day and night looking for her,"" Western Cape police commissioner Thembisile Patekile told local media.
The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) welcomed the sentence and lauded the work of its team in proving that Joshlin was ""sold [and] delivered to the intended buyer"" for the purpose of ""exploitation, namely slavery or practices similar to slavery"".
During the trial, the identity of the ""intended buyer"" was never revealed.
The BBC asked the NPA for further details, however a spokesperson was unable to provide any.
Emotions were high ahead of the sentencing, with angry community members saying the trio should get a ""harsh sentence because they deserve it"".
Joshlin's grandmother has said she does not feel that any sentence can bring back her granddaughter
Ahead of sentencing, Joshlin's grandmother, Amanda Smith-Daniels, once again pleaded with her daughter to ""bring my [grand]child back or tell me where she is"".
""I don't feel that any sentence they get will bring my grandchild back,"" she told local broadcaster Newzroom Afrika.
Ms Smith-Daniels said that Joshlin's disappearance had left her family ""broken"". 
She urged her daughter to stop blaming others for her misfortune as she ""was the person that did the deed"".
During the trial, the court heard testimonies from more than 30 witnesses, who painted a picture of the young girl's troubled life and subsequent disappearance. 
Kelly Smith and her accomplices refused to testify or call any witnesses for their defence.
The most explosive came from Lourentia Lombaard, a friend and neighbour of Smith who turned state witness.
Ms Lombaard alleged that Smith told her she had done ""something silly"" and sold Joshlin to a traditional healer, known in South Africa as a ""sangoma"".
The ""person who [allegedly took] Joshlin wanted her for her eyes and skin"", Ms Lombaard told the court.
A local pastor testified that in 2023, he had heard Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; Â£850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.
Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already ""on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa"".
It was the testimonies of Ms Lombard and the clergyman that were key to securing a conviction.
During sentencing hearings, Smith was described as manipulative and someone who told ""bald-faced lies"". A social worker appointed to compile a report on Smith and her accomplices, went so far as to say it would not be a ""stretch to conclude that [Kelly] Smith is the mastermind behind the trafficking of her own daughter"".
The court also heard powerful statements from those who knew Joshlin about the devastating effect of her disappearance on the community.

Airline passengers to Turkey will be fined if they stand up before the seatbelt sign turns off after landing, regulators have said.
The Turkish civil aviation authority said it imposed the order after receiving complaints from passengers. The rules came into effect earlier this month. 
Turkish media reports say fines will be about about US$70 (Â£50), although no amount is mentioned in the authority's guidance. 
The authority warned that there was a ""serious increase"" in such incidents, with many complaints about passengers grabbing overhead baggage before the plane has been parked.
Turkey is a destination for tens of millions of tourists every year.
The aviation authority said commercial airlines must now issue an in-flight announcement and report those who do not follow orders.
Passengers must be told to keep their seatbelts locked, and refrain from standing and opening overhead lockers until the seatbelt sign is off. 
Those who do not follow these rules must be reported to the authority, it says. 
Turkish Airlines, the national carrier, has updated its landing announcement, according to Euronews. 
""Passengers who do not comply with the rules will be reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation through a Disruptive Passenger Report, and an administrative fine will be imposed in accordance with the applicable legal regulations,"" the airline says upon landing, according to the TV network. 
The BBC has contacted the airline for comment."

France's National Assembly has voted to abolish low-emission zones, a key measure introduced during President Emmanuel Macron's first term to reduce city pollution.
So-called ZFEs (zones Ã  faibles Ã©missions) have been criticised for hitting those who cannot afford less-polluting vehicles the hardest.
A handful of MPs from Macron's party joined opposition parties from the right and far right in voting 98-51 to scrap the zones, which have gradually been extended across French cities since 2019.
The motion was put forward by Pierre Meurin of the far-right National Rally, and backed by some motoring organisations.
But it was a personal victory for writer Alexandre Jardin who set up a movement called Les #Gueux (Beggars), arguing that ""ecology has turned into a sport for the rich"".
""Everyone played their part in the vote. The MPs voted either for the end of this nightmare, or they abstained,"" he told Le Figaro newspaper.
""They were afraid of going back to their constituencies if they had voted against the abolition of the ZFEs.""
The low-emission zones began with 15 of France's most polluted cities in 2019 and by the start of this year had been extended to every urban area with a population of more than 150,000, with a ban on cars registered before 1997.
Those produced after 1997 need a round ""Crit'Air"" sticker to drive in low-emission zones, and there are six categories that correspond to various types of vehicle.
The biggest restrictions have been applied in the most polluted cities, Paris and Lyon, as well as Montpellier and Grenoble.
Alexandre Jardin has led a campaign to fight the low-emission zones in France 
They have turned into something of a lightning rod for Macron's opponents. 
Marine Le Pen condemned the ZFEs as ""no-rights zones"" during her presidential campaign for National Rally in 2022, and her Communist counterpart warned of a ""social bomb"".
The head of the right-wing Republicans in the Assembly, Laurent Wauquiez, talked of ""freeing the French from stifling, punitive ecology"", and on the far left, ClÃ©mence GuettÃ© said green policies should not be imposed ""on the backs of the working classes"".
The government tried to head off Wednesday night's revolt by watering down the restrictions, but also preserving the zones in Paris and Lyon. This amendment was defeated by a large margin.
AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher, the minister for green transition, told MPs that ""air pollution is behind almost 40,000 premature deaths a year... and the low-emission zones have helped bring down [that number]"".
The Greens and Socialists also voted to maintain the zones. 
Green Senator Anne Souyris told BFMTV that ""killing [the ZFEs] also means killing hundreds of thousands of people"" and Socialist MP GÃ©rard Leseul said the vote sent a negative signal as it did not address the reduction that had to be made to levels of air pollution.
The abolition is expected to go through the upper house, France's Senate, but it still needs to be approved in a broader bill in the lower house in June and will have to be approved by France's Constitutional Council, which is not guaranteed."

Peng Yujiang, 55, was testing new equipment at 3,000m above sea level, over the Qilian mountains, when a rare updraft or air current known as a ""cloud suck"" pulled him about 5,000m higher into a cloud formation.
Saturday's events were filmed on a camera that was mounted on Mr Peng's glider and the footage has gone viral after being posted on Douyin, China's version of TikTok.
It showed Mr Peng holding on to the glider's controls, with his face and much of his body covered in ice crystals.
""It was terrifying... Everything was white. I couldn't see any direction. Without the compass, I wouldn't have known which way I was going. I thought I was flying straight, but in reality, I was spinning,"" he told China Media Group.
Mr Peng narrowly survived death as oxygen is thin at that altitude - slightly lower than the 8,849m peak of Mount Everest. Temperatures can also fall to -40C.
""I wanted to come down quickly, but I just couldn't. I was lifted higher and higher until I was inside the cloud,"" he said.
Mr Peng, who has been paragliding for four and a half years, said he might have lost consciousness during his descent. 
He added that the most frightening part of his ordeal was trying to regain control of the glider as it spiralled in the air.
Chinese authorities are investigating the incident and Mr Peng has been suspended for six months because the flight was unauthorised, state-run Global Times reported.
Mr Peng had no intention to fly that day and was only testing the fit and comfort of his parachute on the ground, Global Times said.
However, strong winds lifted him off the ground and grew even stronger, until he encountered the updraft that shot him up into the clouds."

Two people are reported to have died and several others injured in the incident, the programme said, adding that it was still confirming details.
Footage showed thousands of people breaking into the Al-Ghafari warehouse in Deir Al-Balah and taking bags of flour and cartons of food as gunshots rang out. It was not immediately clear where the gunshots came from or who fired them. 
In a statement, the WFP said humanitarian needs in Gaza had ""spiralled out of control"" after an almost three-month Israeli blockade that was eased last week.
The WFP said that food supplies had been pre-positioned at the warehouse for distribution.
The programme added: ""Gaza needs an immediate scale-up of food assistance. This is the only way to reassure people that they will not starve.""
The WFP said it had ""consistently warned of alarming and deteriorating conditions on the ground, and the risks imposed by limiting humanitarian aid to hungry people in desperate need of assistance"". 
Israeli authorities said on Wednesday that 121 trucks belonging to the UN and the international community carrying humanitarian aid including flour and food were transferred into Gaza.
Israel began to allow a limited amount of aid into Gaza last week. However, UN Middle East envoy Sigrid Kaag told the UN Security Council this was ""comparable to a lifeboat after the ship has sunk"" when everyone in Gaza was facing the risk of famine.
A controversial US and Israeli-backed group - the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) - was also established as a private aid distribution system. It uses US security contractors and bypasses the UN, which said it was unworkable and unethical.
The US and Israeli governments say the GHF, which has set up four distribution centres in southern and central Gaza, is preventing aid from being stolen by Hamas, which the armed group denies doing.
Large numbers of hungry people living in tents along the coast of Gaza have been going to the GHF distribution centres for food.
The UN Humans Right Office said 47 people were injured on Tuesday after people overran one of the GHF distribution sites in the southern city of Rafah, a day after it began working there.
Another senior UN official told journalists on Wednesday that desperate crowds were looting cargo off of UN aid trucks.
Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN's humanitarian office for the occupied Palestinian territories, also said there was no evidence that Hamas was diverting aid coordinated through credible humanitarian channels.
He said the real theft of relief goods since the beginning of the war had been carried out by criminal gangs which the Israeli army ""allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point in Gaza"".
The UN has argued that a surge of aid like the one during the recent ceasefire between Israeli and Hamas would reduce the threat of looting by hungry people and allow it to make full use of its well-established network of distribution across the Gaza Strip.
Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said the UN was behaving in a ""mafia-like"" way and accused it of threatening aid agencies working with the GHF. 
The UN has said Israeli's new aid distribution system in Gaza is ""essentially engineered scarcity"", adding that it operates only in the south of the territory when most of the population is in the north."

Haribo is recalling packets of sweets in the Netherlands after some were found to contain traces of cannabis.
Several people, including multiple members of one family, reported feeling unwell after eating from a 1kg pack of Haribo Happy Cola F!ZZ.
A spokesperson for the food safety body in the Netherlands (NVWA) said some had reported ""dizziness"" after eating the sweets. The agency told Dutch broadcaster SBS6, external that ""samples were taken and cannabis was found in them"".
A Haribo spokesperson told the BBC it was working with police to ""establish the facts around the contamination"". 
NVWA said three packs were found to be contaminated, but Haribo is recalling its entire stock as a precaution.
The bags in question have a best-before date of January 2026.
It is not clear how many people have become unwell. 
NVWA said police were investigating how cannabis ended up in the sweets, Dutch media report.
The agency said there were bags in circulation that ""can lead to health complaints, such as dizziness, when consumed"".
""Do not eat the sweets,"" the statement added.
It is not clear whether the contaminated products are genuine Haribo bags or fake.
Haribo said the safety of its consumers was its highest priority, adding that it was taking the incident ""very seriously"".

US President Donald Trump has appeared to set a two-week deadline for Vladimir Putin, threatening a different response if the Russian counterpart was still stringing him along.
As the Kremlin escalated its attacks on Ukraine, Trump was asked in the Oval Office on Wednesday if he thought Putin wanted to end the war. 
""I can't tell you that, but I'll let you know in about two weeks,"" Trump told reporters, the latest amid a string of critical public remarks made by Trump about Putin. 
Since Sunday, Trump has written multiple posts on social media saying that Putin has gone ""absolutely crazy"" and is ""playing with fire"" after Russia intensified its attacks on Ukraine.
The bombardments by Russia are said to have been some of the largest and deadliest attacks since the start of the war, now in its fourth year.
Russian strikes in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, killed at least 13 people and injured dozens more, including children, over the weekend. 
And by Wednesday, the attacks had shown no signs of slowing down.
In Trump's remarks about the escalation of violence and whether he thinks Putin is serious about ending the war, Trump said: ""I'll let you know in about two weeks.
""Within two weeks. We're gonna find out whether or not (Putin is) tapping us along or not. 
""And if he is, we'll respond a little bit differently.""  
The comments are a sign of Trump's growing frustration, as the White House's repeated efforts to negotiate a deal between Russia and Ukraine appear ever more futile.
This includes a recent two-hour phone call between Trump and Putin, after which the US president said the discussions went ""very well"". 
Putin walked away from the call saying he was ready to work with Ukraine on a ""memorandum on a possible future peace agreement"".
That call was one week before Russia launched hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles towards Ukraine's capital, according to Ukraine's air force. 
And a memorandum has yet to be produced by Russia.
So far, Trump's threats have not appeared to concern Moscow sufficiently for it to accede to his demands. Trump has not delivered on previous such threats.
Since taking office, Trump has only taken action against Ukraine, as Washington  sought to steer the countries to Trump's demand for a truce. 
This included an eight-day suspension of US military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kyiv in March. 
Meanwhile the US administration has not publicly demanded any significant concessions from Russia.
The White House rejects accusations of appeasing Moscow or failing to enforce its will, pointing out that all the Biden-era sanctions remain in force against Russia. 
But so far its mediation approach appears to have made the Kremlin more, not less, empowered. 
After the latest attacks, Trump wrote on Truth Social that ""something has happened"" to Putin, which the Kremlin said were comments made ""connected to an emotional overload"". 
Russia's attacks on Ukraine continued in the days afterwards. Trump then escalated his criticism. On Tuesday, he said Putin was ""playing with fire"" and that ""lots of bad things"" would have happened to Russia if it were not for Trump's involvement.
A Kremlin aid responded to the latest Trump Truth Social post by saying: ""We have come to the conclusion that Trump is not sufficiently informed about what is really happening.""
Putin aide Yury Ushakov told Russian state TV channel Russia-1 that Trump must be unaware of ""the increasingly frequent massive terrorist attacks Ukraine is carrying out against peaceful Russian cities.""
On Wednesday, Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, told Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky that Berlin will help Kyiv produce long-range missiles to defend itself from Russian attack.
The Kremlin has warned that any decision to end range restrictions on the missiles that Ukraine can use would be a dangerous change in policy that would harm efforts to reach a political deal.
In the face of Russia's recalcitrance, Trump has frequently softened his demands, shifting the emphasis from his original call for an immediate 30-day ceasefire, to which only Ukraine agreed, to more recently demanding a summit with Putin to get what he says would be a breakthrough. 
Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have upped their demands from earlier positions since the US restored contacts with the Russians in February. 
These have included a demand that Ukraine cede parts of its own country not even occupied by Russia and that the US recognises Crimea as a formal part of Russia. 
Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Moscow, calls this a ""poison pill"" introduced by Russia: Creating conditions Kyiv could never agree to in order to shift blame onto Ukraine in Trump's eyes.
The war has claimed tens of thousands of lives and left much of Ukraine's east and south in ruins. Moscow controls roughly one-fifth of the country's territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.
Zelensky has accused Moscow of delaying the peace process and said they were yet to deliver a promised memorandum of peace terms following talks in Istanbul. Peskov insisted the document was in its ""final stages."""

The victims of prolific French paedophile Joel Le Scouarnec have expressed their dismay that the former surgeon's 20-year prison sentence does not include preventive detention - meaning he could be released from jail in the early 2030s.
The 74-year-old was found guilty on Tuesday of sexually abusing hundreds of people, most of them underage patients of his, over decades. 
Over the course of the trial he had confessed to committing 111 rapes and 188 sexual assaults, and was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in jail. 
Prosecutors - who dubbed Le Scouarnec ""a devil in a white coat"" - had asked the court to take the extremely rare provision to hold him in a centre for treatment and supervision even after release, called preventive detention.
The judge rejected this demand, arguing Le Scouarnec's age and his ""desire to make amends"" had been taken into account.
Le Scouarnec will have to serve two-thirds of his sentence before being eligible for parole. 
But because he has already served seven years due to a previous conviction for the rape and sexual assault of four children, he may be eligible for parole by 2032.
His lawyer, Maxime Tessier, pointed out that saying Le Scouarnec could be released then was ""inaccurate"", as parole is not tantamout a release.
Now, his victims - many of whom assiduously attended the three-month-long trial in Vannes, northern France - are lamenting the sentence. 
""For a robbery you risk 30 years. But the punishment for hundreds of child rapes is lighter?"" one victim told Le Monde. 
The president of a child advocacy group, SolÃ¨ne Podevin Favre, said that she might have expected the verdict ""to be less lenient"" and to include a post-sentence preventive detention.
""It's the maximum sentence, certainly,"" she said. ""But it's the least we could have hoped for. Yet in six years, he could potentially be released. It's staggering.""
Marie Grimaud, one of the lawyers representing the victims, told reporters that while she ""intellectually"" understood the verdict, ""symbolically"" she could not.
Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon, admitted to all the charges against him
Another lawyer, Francesca Satta, said that she felt 20 years was too short a time given the number of victims in the case. 
""It is time for the law to change so we can have more appropriate sentences,"" she argued.
But in her judgement read out to the court, Judge Aude BurÃ©si said that, while the court had ""heard perfectly the demands from the plaintiffs that Le Scouarnec should never be released from jail, it would be demagogic and fanciful to let them believe that would be possible"".
""In fact,"" she added, ""the rule of law does not allow for that to happen.""
One of Le Scouarnec's victims, AmÃ©lie LÃ©vÃªque, said the verdict had ""shocked"" her and that she would have liked preventive detention to be imposed. ""How many victims would it take? A thousand?""
She argued that French law needed to change and allow for harsher sentences to take into account the serial nature of crimes. 
Similar complaints were raised in the aftermath of the Pelicot trial last December, in which Dominique Pelicot was found guilty of drugging and raping his wife, GisÃ¨le, and recruited dozens of men to abuse her over almost a decade. 
Pelicot, too, was sentenced to 20 years - the maximum sentence for rape in French law - with the obligation to serve a minimum of two-thirds in jail.
His case, however, will have to be re-examined at the end of the prison sentence before the question of preventive detention can be explored. 
In France, sentences are not served consecutively. Public prosecutor StÃ©phane Kellenberger noted last week that had Le Scouarnec been on trial in the US - where people serve one prison sentence after another - he may have faced a sentence of over 4,000 years. 
But CÃ©cile de Oliveira, one of the victims' lawyers, praised the sentence, which she said had been ""finely tailored"" to Le Scouarnec's ""psychiatric condition"". 
She agreed with the court's decision not to impose preventive detention on the former surgeon, adding: ""It needs to remain an entirely exceptional punishment.""
After the verdict was read out, victims, journalists and lawyers mingled outside the courthouse in Vannes. Many of the civil parties and their relatives, angered by the verdict, brought their frustration to the media. 
""All that I ask for is that this man cannot offend again,"" the mother of a victim told French outlets. 
""If this kind of behaviour needs to entail a life sentence, so be it."""

Motown legend Smokey Robinson has filed a $500m (Â£370m) defamation lawsuit against four former housekeepers who have accused the singer of sexual assault.
The legal case filed by the star and his wife Frances on Wednesday in California accused the women of fabricating the sexual assault allegations as part of an ""extortionate"" lawsuit.
The Robinsons say the alleged victims, who filed their case anonomously, went on family holidays with the couple and celebrated holidays together.
The singer, who is now also under criminal investigation in Los Angeles over accusations of sexual assault, has denied all  the allegations, and his lawyer said those behind the accusations were after his money.
Mr Robinson's lawyers also filed a motion to dismiss the women's lawsuit, arguing they should not have been granted anonymity.
""The Robinsons did not abuse, harm, or take advantage of plaintiffs; they treated plaintiffs with the utmost kindness and generosity,"" the lawsuit states.
The women filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on 6 May under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4.
In the 27-page legal action, they alleged several incidents that they said dated back to 2006, and accused Mr Robinson of pressuring them into sex.
All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihoods, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status.
They are seeking at least $50m (Â£38m) in damages and a jury trial.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department then opened its investigation, which the 85-year-old singer said at the time he welcomed ""because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing"".
Mr Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one records like Mary Wells' My Guy and The Temptations' My Girl.

The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every one of the world's countries.
The New York-based court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, and that this was not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy.
The White House has asked the court to block the order suspending tariffs while it appeals the case.
Follow live updates after the court ruling
The ruling was based on two separate cases. The nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center brought one case on behalf of several small businesses that import goods from countries that were targeted by the duties, while a coalition of US state governments also challenged the import taxes.
The two cases marked the first major legal challenges to Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs and went to the Court of International Trade, a part of the federal court system with specific authority over trade.
A three-judge panel ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that Trump cited to justify the tariffs, did not give him the power to impose the sweeping import taxes.
The court also blocked a separate set of levies the Trump administration imposed on China, Mexico and Canada, in response to what the administration said was the unacceptable flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into the US.
However, the court was not asked to address tariffs imposed on some specific goods like cars, steel and aluminium, which fall under a different law.
The White House has criticised the ruling, though Trump has not yet commented directly.
""It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,"" White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai said in a statement.
But Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, one of 12 states involved in the lawsuit, welcomed the decision. 
""The law is clear: no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes whenever they like,"" she said.
Stock markets in Asia and US rose in early trading on Thursday following the ruling while European markets opened flat.
What tariffs has Trump announced, and why?
Trump agrees to extend EU trade talks after 50% tariff threat
For now, the court has given the White House has 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although some are currently suspended anyway.
Meanwhile, the White House has asked the court to block the order while it appeals it.
The case could eventually go to the Supreme Court - the highest court in the US - but even if Trump lost there it would not necessarily spell the end of his tariff plans. 
For one thing, the ruling noted that the president does have the power to impose tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address concerns about the balance of trade, which the White House had argued were an emergency.
If the administration chose to go that route, those new tariffs could go into effect within days, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. 
Trump could also turn to the other, more established laws that he used in his first term to justify tariffs, which focus on issues such as national security and unfair trade policies. Those require investigations and periods of public comment before tariffs go into effect.
Goldman Sachs said Trump might also turn to an untested part of a 1930 trade law that allows the President to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that ""discriminate"" against the US. 
On 2 April, Trump unveiled an unprecedented global tariff regime by imposing import taxes on most of the US's trading partners.
A 10% baseline tariff was placed on most countries, along with steeper reciprocal tariffs handed down to dozens of nations and blocs, including allies such as the EU, UK, Canada, Mexico and China.
Trump argued that the sweeping economic policy would boost American manufacturing and protect jobs, while kick-starting negotiations over trade policies it views as unfair.
Global markets have been thrown into disarray since the announcement, but Trump has since backed down on some tariffs and reduced or delayed others.
For now, John Leonard, a former top official at the CBP, told the BBC that there would not be any changes at the border and that tariffs would still have to be paid.
If the White House is unsuccessful in its appeal, the US Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) would then issue directions to its officers to refund the payments, he said. 
The ruling also raises questions about ongoing trade talks between the US and other countries. The White House had argued in court hearings that its negotiating position would be weakened if the court struck down the tariffs. 
Paul Ashworth, from Capital Economics, said the ruling ""will obviously throw into disarray the Trump administration's push to quickly seal trade 'deals' during the 90-day pause from tariffs"".
He predicted other countries ""will wait and see"" what happens next.
The UK and US governments agreed a deal to reduce tariffs on some goods traded between the countries earlier this month.
It included the lowering and removal of import taxes on some of the UK's main exports to America, such as cars, steel and aluminium.
That aspect of the deal is not impacted by the court ruling, but the blanket 10% tariff on most other UK goods entering the US has now been called into question.
How that part of the deal could change remains uncertain following the ruling, with the agreement between both governments yet to be implemented.
The UK government has not commented on the court ruling but said it was working to ensure British businesses can benefit from the deal ""as quickly as possible"".
What questions do you have about tariffs?"

A 250kg glide bomb has ripped through the town's main administrative building, and taken down three residential blocks. We're visiting a day after the bomb struck, but parts of the wreckage are still smoking. From the edges of the town we hear the sound of artillery fire, and of gunshots â Ukrainian soldiers shooting down drones.
Rodynske is about 15km (9 miles) north of the embattled city of Pokrovsk. Russia has been trying to capture it from the south since the autumn of last year, but Ukrainian forces have so far managed to stop Russian soldiers from marching in.
So Russia has changed tactics, moving instead to encircle the city, cutting off supply routes. 
In the past two weeks, as hectic diplomatic efforts to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine have failed, Russia has intensified its push, making its most significant advances since January.
We find proof of that in Rodynske.
Within minutes of us arriving in town, we hear a Russian drone above us. Our team runs to the closest cover available â a tree.
Fibre optic drones are a terrifying new danger on Ukraine's front lines
We press up against it so the drone won't see us. Then there's the sound of a loud explosion â it's a second drone making impact nearby. The drone above us is still hovering. For a few more minutes, we hear the terrifying whirring sound of what's become the deadliest weapon of this war.
When we can't hear it any more we take the chance to run to hard cover in an abandoned building 100ft away.
From the shelter, we hear the drone again. It's possible it returned after seeing our movement.
That Rodynske is being swarmed by Russian drones is evidence that the attacks are coming from positions much closer than known Russian positions to the south of Pokrovsk. They were most likely coming from newly captured territory on a key road running from the east of Pokrovsk to Kostyantynivka.
After half an hour of waiting in the shelter, when we can't hear the drone anymore, we move quickly to our car parked under tree cover, and speed out of Rodynske. By the side of the highway we see smoke billowing and something burning â it's most likely a downed drone.
Towns like Rodynske are now ruined shells, pummelled by Russian air assaults
We drive to Bilytske, further away from the frontline. We see a row of houses destroyed by a missile strike overnight. One of them was Svitlana's home.
""It's getting worse and worse. Earlier, we could hear distant explosions, they were far away. But now our town is getting targeted â we're experiencing it ourselves,"" says the 61-year-old, as she picks up a few belongings from the wreckage of her home. Luckily Svitlana wasn't at home when the attack occurred.
""Go into the centre of the town, you'll see so much that is destroyed there. And the bakery and zoo have been destroyed too,"" she says.
At a safehouse just out of reach of drones, we meet soldiers of the artillery unit of the 5th Assault Brigade.
""You can feel the intensity of Russian assaults increasing. Rockets, mortars, drones, they're using everything they have to cut off supply routes going into the city,"" says Serhii.
His unit has been waiting for three days to deploy to their positions, waiting for cloud cover or high-speed winds to give them protection from drones.
Serhii's unit had to wait days to deploy to their frontline positions, because of the drone threat
In an ever-evolving conflict, soldiers have had to rapidly adapt to new threats posed by changing technology. And the latest threat comes from fibre optic drones. A spool of tens of kilometres of cable is fitted to the bottom of a drone and the physical fibre optic cord is attached to the controller held by the pilot.
""The video and control signal is transmitted to and from the drone through the cable, not through radio frequencies. This means it can't be jammed by electronic interceptors,"" says a soldier with the call sign Moderator, a drone engineer with the 68th Jaeger Brigade.
When drones began to be used in this war in a big way, both militaries fitted their vehicles with electronic warfare systems, which could neutralise drones. That protection has evaporated with the arrival of fibre optic drones, and in the deployment of these devices, Russia currently has the edge. Ukraine is trying to ramp up production.
""Russia started using fibre optic drones much before us, while we were still testing them. These drones can be used in places where we have to go lower than usual drones. We can even enter houses and look for targets inside,"" says Venia, a drone pilot with the 68th Jaeger Brigade.
""We've started joking that maybe we should carry scissors to cut the cord,"" says Serhii, the artillery man.
Fibre optic drones do have drawbacks â they are slower and the cable could get entangled in trees. But at the moment, their widespread use by Russia means that transporting soldiers to and from their positions can often be deadlier than the battlefield itself.
Moderator works on Ukrainian fibre optic drones, to use against the invaders
""When you enter a position, you don't know whether you've been spotted or not. And if you have been spotted, then you may already be living the last hours of your life,"" says Oles, Chief Sergeant of the reconnaissance unit of the 5th Assault Brigade.
This threat means that soldiers are spending longer and longer in their positions. 
Oles and his men are in the infantry, serving in the trenches right at the very front of Ukraine's defence. It's rare for journalists these days to speak to infantrymen, as it's become too risky to go to these trenches. We meet Oles and Maksym in a rural home converted into a makeshift base, where the soldiers come to rest when they're not on deployment.
""The longest I spent at the position was 31 days, but I do know guys who have spent 90 and even 120 days there. Back before the drones arrived, the rotations could have been between 3 or 7 days at the position,"" says Maksym.
""War is blood, death, wet mud and a chill that spreads from head to toe. And this is how you spend every day. I remember one instance when we didn't sleep for three days, alert every minute. The Russians kept coming at us wave after wave. Even a minor lapse would have meant we were dead.""
Oles says Russia's infantry has changed its tactics. ""Earlier they attacked in groups. Now they only send one or two people at times. They also use motorcycles and in a few instances, quad bikes. Sometimes they slip through.""
What this means is that the front lines in some parts are no longer conventional lines with the Ukrainians on one side and the Russians on the other, but more like pieces on a chessboard during play, where positions can be intertwined.
This also makes it harder to see advances made by either side.
Despite Russia's recent gains, it will not be quick or easy for it to take the whole of the Donetsk region, where Pokrovsk lies.
Ukraine has pushed back hard, but it needs a steady supply of weapons and ammunition to sustain the fight.
And as the war enters a fourth summer, Ukraine's manpower issues against a much bigger Russian army are also evident. Most of the soldiers we meet joined the military after the war began. They've had a few months of training, but have had to learn a lot on the job in the middle of a raging war.
Maksym worked for a drinks company before he joined the military. I asked how his family copes with his job.
""It's hard, it's really hard. My family really supports me. But I have a two-year-old son, and I don't get to see him much. I do video call him though, so everything is as fine as it could be under the circumstances,"" he trails off, eyes welling up with tears.
Maksym is a soldier fighting for his country, but he's also just a father missing his two-year-old boy.

13,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxk480g75qo,2025-05-29 02:01:15,"Tears and heartbreak over tragic story of South African girl sold by her mother,","A video clip of a laughing Joshlin Smith, who was six years old when she went missing more than a year ago in South Africa, left most people in the courtroom sobbing.
It was shown during a hearing in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, ahead of the life sentence given to Joshlin's mother - a drug addict who is believed to have sold her for money.
Racquel Smith, also known as Kelly Smith, was convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her daughter earlier this month. The 35-year-old mother of three was convicted and sentenced along with her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn.
Even the court interpreter could not hold back her tears as she translated the victim impact statements into English.
A court official read out those statements first in Afrikaans, the language spoken by those in the impoverished Middelpos informal settlement of Saldanha Bay, where Joshlin had lived.
In their own words, Joshlin's grandmother, the family friend who had wanted to adopt Joshlin and her teacher spoke of their pain and bewilderment about how she could have been sold by her mother.
One witness during the trial had alleged this was to a traditional healer, known in South Africa as a ""sangoma"", who wanted Joshlin for ""her eyes and skin"". 
A local pastor also testified that he had once heard Smith talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; Â£850) each, but would have been willing to accept a lower figure of $275.
""How do you sleep [and] live with yourself?"" a devastated Amanda Smith-Daniels, asked her daughter in her victim statement on Wednesday. She now looks after Smith's oldest child and the youngest stays with her father.
Smith and her co-accused refused to take the stand during the eight-week trial that began in March and was held at a community centre in Saldanha to allow the wider community to attend proceedings.
But as Joshlin's mother heard the statements on Wednesday and saw the video clip, she sobbed uncontrollably.
Joshlin's teacher, Edna Maart, described the little girl as a quiet pupil who was ""very tidy"".
She said she struggled with daily questions from Joshlin's schoolmates about her whereabouts.
Determined not to forget her, she said the class listened to her favourite gospel song God Will Work It Out at the start of every school day. It was also played to a teary courtroom on Wednesday.
To this day no-one knows what has happened to Joshlin.
Joshlin Smith's mother and her co-accused refused to testify
Her disappearance on 19 February 2024 caused shockwaves across the country. Bianca van Aswegen, a criminologist and national co-ordinator at Missing Children South Africa, likened it to the case of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who went missing in Portugal in 2007.
Madeleine was aged three when she vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve - and hers is one of the most high-profile, unsolved missing person cases in the world.
Ms Van Aswegen told the BBC that while the trio's conviction in Joshlin's case had given people a sense of relief, ""the matter of fact is that nobody knows where Joshlin is and I think that's the big question that South Africa is still asking"".
A picture of Joshlin's troubled life emerged during the trial - and a better sense of her personality during this week's hearings ahead of sentencing.
She was born in October 2017, to Smith and her former partner Jose Emke, who broke down on Wednesday and had to be carried out of the courtroom.
Their second child - she and her older brother, now 11, had both suffered from neglect, according to a social worker who testified during the trial.
Growing up, Kelly Smith had lived with her maternal grandmother and had struggled with substance abuse since she was 15 - often becoming abusive towards her and her children when she was high, social workers said.
A report prepared by a social worker for the sentencing hearing paints a stark picture of Smith's drug addiction at the time of Joshlin's birth.
Her grandmother had kicked Smith out of the family home because of her drug use and she had threatened to stab her own son at that time.
The judge noted that it took Smith five months to register Joshlin's birth - by law this must be done within 30 days - and had lived intermittently at a shelter for abused women.
When she went into rehab later on, family friend Natasha Andrews stepped in to care for Joshlin - and she and her husband had wanted to adopt her.
""We could have provided for her better than her mother,"" Ms Andrews said during the trial, but the plans fell apart in 2018 as the parents ""wouldn't agree"" to it.
Despite this, Joshlin often visited the Andrews family for weekends and school holidays and would go on trips with them.
The clip shown in court on Wednesday of Joshlin laughing was from one of those holidays and formed part of Ms Andrews' victim statement.
She shared this and other photos of Joshlin playing with her own daughter because ""so many peopleâ¦ don't know what Joshlin sounds like"", she said.
It was this and her description of her family's pain that sparked the greatest outpouring of emotion in the courtroom.
Joshlin grew up in a corrugated iron structure located in Middelpos informal settlement with her mother, her mother's partner, her brother and younger half-sister.
The social workers' report described the shack as offering ""little in the way of privacy due to its highly restrictive living space"".
This is the shack where Joshlin and her family lived
Smith did odd jobs to support her family, including part-time domestic work for Kelly Zeegers, who lived with her family in a nearby neighbourhood and paid her with groceries instead of cash.
""This is to make sure that she and the children have a plate of food,"" Ms Zeegers said during her testimony.
Some witnesses did describe Smith as a good mother; her sister told the court Joshlin was the spitting image of her mum when she was young.
The little that is known of what happened to Joshlin on the day she disappeared is thanks to Laurentia Lombaard, who turned state witness. She had been at the shack smoking drugs with Appollis and Van Rhyn at the time.
She explained that Joshlin, who had started school a few weeks before her disappearance, and her brother had stayed at home that day because they did not have clean uniforms.
The children had been mainly left in the care of Appollis as Smith was in and out during course of the day, occasionally returning to smoke.
It is not clear exactly how or when Joshlin went missing but the trial established it was some time during the afternoon - but the preoccupation of most of the adults meant the disappearance was only reported to the police at 21:00.
The social worker appointed to compile the report on the trio ahead of their sentencing described Smith as ""manipulative"" and someone who told ""bald-faced lies"".
""It is therefore not a stretch to conclude that Smith is the mastermind behind the trafficking of her own daughter,"" he said.
A community centre has played host to the High Court trial 
Ms Van Aswegen said Joshlin's disappearance reflected a growing crisis in child trafficking.
""It is much more of a crisis than police stats actually show us due to the fact of many cases going unreported,"" she told the BBC.
She said what was unusual in Joshlin's case was that it had captured the whole nation.
""I have never really seen a case blow up like this in South Africa before [and] neither have we seen such a big search for a missing child. I think social media played a big role [and] we had political parties get involved in the case.""
According to South African news site IOL, 632 children were reported missing last year and 8,743 over the past 10 years.
Earlier this month, police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said many children were eventually reunited with their families.
Ms Van Aswegen said this showed that one could never give up hope and the search for Joshlin would continue.
This hope was reflected most by the Andrews family during the sentencing hearing.
A poem written by Ms Andrews' 14-year-old daughter Tayla was also read out in court.  It described her pain of not knowing what had happened to Joshlin and her hope that she was safe.
""We just want to hug you again,"" Ms Andrews' said in her statement. ""You are our flower, our baby and our green-eyed child.""

The Rainbow Bridge, which crosses the Niagara River between the United States and Canada, has for decades been a symbol of peace connecting two countries.
But for Araceli, a Salvadorian migrant, and her family, the bridge represented a seemingly insurmountable hurdle.
Along with her partner and two daughters, aged four and 14, the family first attempted to cross the bridge on 17 March.
They had arrived with a suitcase and documents that they believed assured them they would soon be reunited with Araceli's siblings on Canadian soil and escape the threat of US President Donald Trump's mass deportations.
But the plan failed. Not just once, but twice.
While a third attempt proved successful, immigration experts and official statistics point to a rise of asylum seekers at the border fleeing not just their homelands, but President Trump's immigration policies.
Araceli and her family had been living illegally in the US for more than a decade â only her youngest daughter, who was born in New Jersey, has a US passport.
In the US, Araceli built a life for herself and tried to initiate an asylum application process, but was unsuccessful.
""They charged me money and told me I would get a work permit. I paid that to a lawyer, but they never gave me an answer as to whether it was approved or not,"" she told BBC Mundo from a migrant shelter near the US-Canada border.
Araceli has 12 siblings, and like her, several left El Salvador due to safety concerns in the rural community where they grew up. Two of them managed to start from scratch in Canada.
After President Trump's inauguration, amid reports of mass raids and deportations, Araceli began to fear for her and her family's safety â especially after the administration began sending illegal migrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison.
But because both Canada and the US have signed onto the ""safe third country agreement,"" migrants, like Araceli, who have been denied refuge in one country are not supposed to be granted asylum in the other. The agreement states that asylum seekers must apply for asylum in the first country where they land.
The Rainbow Bridge connects the US to Canada
There are exceptions. One of them is if the asylum seeker arriving from the US can prove they have a close relative in Canada who meets certain requirements, they can enter the country and begin their refugee claim again.
So Araceli and her family said goodbye to the life they had built in the US to join her two brothers in Canada.
After crossing the Rainbow Bridge, they arrived at the border check point to make their asylum claim. She said she had all the original documents proving her relationship to her brother.
""They took everything, even our backpack, and we were left with nothing,""
They spent the entire night in a waiting room, occasionally answering questions, until an agent found a problem with the application.
""They found a small detail: on my [birth] certificate, my father only had one last name, and on my brother's, he had two.""
And although the document had a clarification explaining that such inaccuracies are common in El Salvador, the agent denied them entry to Canada.
The Rainbow Bridge is one of the few places you can easily walk through customs
The family returned, resigned and anguished, having to face their greatest fear: being separated and deported.
At the US checkpoint, they were put in a room with no windows.
""The four of us spent 14 days in that cell,"" Araceli said, clarifying that they could go out to use the bathroom, but were barely allowed outside.
Her brother reached out to an organisation that works with migrants, who helped them hire an attorney, Heather Neufeld.
While she was preparing their documentation, and without any explanation, the family was given an apparent second chance.
""Two agents arrived at the cell and said: 'Congratulations, you're going to Canada',"" Araceli recalled.
But their hopes were short-lived.
""We've been too generous in welcoming you back here,"" she recalled the agent saying after the family applied for asylum in Canada a second time. ""The United States will see what it does with you.""
A spokesperson declined to comment on Araceli's case in particular, citing the country's privacy laws.
'It's not fair': Other refugees in limbo as US welcomes white South Africans
What is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants?
What is habeas corpus and why might Donald Trump want to suspend it?
One thing is for sure - more families like Araceli's are seeking exceptions to come to Canada.
While the number of people attempting to cross into the United States from Canada has decreased significantly, the number of asylum seekers being denied entry into Canada from the US has increased.
According to official figures from the United States government,13,547 apprehensions were reported along the entire northern border as of March 2025 â a 70% decrease compared to the number recorded in the first quarter of 2024.
Conversely, the number of migrants seeking asylum in Canada and being returned to the US has increased this year, according to data from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).
In April of this year, 359 people, including adults and children, were found ineligible for asylum in Canada, compared to 180 people in April 2024.
Ms Neufeld believes the increase in the number of people turned away is due to ""stricter"" border policy at the Canadian side. In December 2024, Canada announced an investment of C$1.3bn ($950m; Â£705m) to ""strengthen border security and strengthen the immigration system"".
The move was largely seen as an attempt to placate Trump, who has justified widespread tariffs against Canada by blaming the country for illegal immigration into the US.
In February, amid a brewing trade war, the Canadian government announced it would further expand this programme.
The CBSA has also committed to increasing the number of removals from 16,000 to 20,000 (a 25% increase) for fiscal years 2025-2027.
Still, a spokesperson for CBSA told BBC Mundo that they have not changed how they do things: ""We have made no changes to policies or processes"".
Aracely with her two daughters at a migrant shelter in Buffalo, NY
Denied entry to Canada for the second time, Araceli and her family had to cross the border back into the US, which scared them.
""In this day and age, it's not just about being sent to the United States. There's an immediate risk of detention and deportation,"" Ms Neufeld said.
The problem now was that this second trip to Canada was counted as a reconsideration of the case, the only one the family is entitled to under that country's regulations.
Ms Neufeld said that Canadian border agents made a mistake.
""They didn't act like they had in the past with other clients, nor did they agree to an interview with the brother when they normally do,"" she stated.
According to Ms Neufeld, the family didn't return to Canada of their own free will, but because the US authorities told them to, and so their second attempt should not have been considered an official reconsideration.
To get a third opportunity to cross the border and make an asylum claim, Araceli would need a Canadian court to intervene.
When they returned to America, her partner was sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centre, while Araceli was made to wear an ankle monitor and she and her children went to a migrant shelter.
""They came to tell us they were giving us three minutes to say goodbye because my husband was going to be taken to a detention center,"" Araceli recalls, her voice breaking.
A week later, following complex negotiations between the lawyers, a Canadian federal court agreed to allow the family to return to the border to be re-evaluated.
On 5 May, seven weeks after the first attempt, Araceli crossed the bridge once again. This time, she had her lawyer with her.
After 12 hours, a border agent opened the doors and said ""welcome to Canada and good luck with your new life"", she recalled.
""I felt immense joy, it's indescribable,"" Araceli told Canadian public broadcaster CBC earlier in May, adding: ""My daughters gave me so much strength.""
But it was a bittersweet celebration, as her partner remained in the US for two more weeks, caught up in ongoing legal proceedings. The family hired a lawyer to take on his case.
""They managed to get him out on bail, and that's something not all detention centres allow. The whole family had to make a huge effort; they had to sell things to be able to pay for it,"" Ms Neufeld said.
According to her, this family's case reflects the changes that have recently occurred on the northern border.
""There are many more Aracelis, but we can't know where they are or what situation they are facing. Most people lack the capacity to fight to have their rights respected."""

""My nerves are shattered,"" says Noura, a 26-year-old Palestinian woman, explaining that she has been ""left with nothing"".
After years of IVF treatment, she became pregnant in July 2023. ""I was overjoyed,"" she remembers, describing the moment she saw the positive pregnancy test.
She and her husband Mohamed decided to store two more embryos at Al-Basma Fertility Centre in Gaza City, which had helped them conceive, in the hope of having more children in the future.
""I thought my dream had finally come true,"" she says. ""But the day the Israelis came in, something in me said it was all over.""
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
Since then at least 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.
Like thousands of Gazans, Noura and Mohamed had to repeatedly flee, and were unable to get the food, vitamins and medication she needed for a healthy pregnancy.

Noura kept a photo of her positive pregnancy test
""We used to walk for long hours and move constantly from one place to another, amid terrifying random bombings,"" says Mohamed.
Seven months into her pregnancy, Noura suffered a severe haemorrhage.
""She was bleeding heavily, and we couldn't even find a vehicle to take her to the hospital. We finally managed to transport her in a garbage truck,"" Mohamed explains.
""When we arrived, the miscarriage had already started.""
One of their twins was stillborn and the other died a few hours after birth. Mohamed says there were no incubators for premature babies available.
""Everything was gone in a minute,"" says Noura.
As well as losing the twins, they have also lost their frozen embryos.
The director of Al-Basma Fertility Centre, Dr Baha Ghalayini, speaks with sorrow and disbelief as he explains that it was shelled in early December 2023.
He is unable to provide an exact date or time and bases this estimate on the last time a member of staff saw the fertility centre operational.
Dr Ghalayini says the most important part of the clinic housed two tanks that held nearly 4,000 frozen embryos and more than 1,000 samples of sperm and eggs.
The laboratory where eggs were fertilised at Al-Basma clinic was destroyed

""The two destroyed incubators - which cost over $10,000 - were filled with liquid nitrogen that preserved the samples,"" he says.
They needed to be topped up regularly and ""about two weeks before the shelling, the nitrogen began to run low and evaporate"".
The laboratory director, Dr Mohamed Ajjour, who had been displaced to southern Gaza, says he ""made it to the nitrogen warehouse in Al-Nuseirat, and got two tanks"".
But he says the intensity of the shelling prevented him from delivering them to the clinic, about 12km away: ""The centre was shelled and the nitrogen became useless.""
Dr Ghalayini says the centre stored embryos for patients being treated at other clinics as well as their own. ""I'm talking about 4,000 frozen embryos. These are not just numbers, they're people's dreams. People who waited years, went through painful treatments, and pinned their hopes on these tanks that were ultimately destroyed.""
He estimates that between 100 and 150 women lost what may have been their only chance at having children, as many cannot undergo the procedure again. ""Some are getting older, some are cancer patients, others suffer chronic illnesses. Many received strong fertility medications that they can receive just once. Starting again is not easy.""
The patients who came to Al-Basma clinic have all lost the embryos that were stored there
When approached for comment, the Israel Defense Forces told the BBC they would be better able to respond if the ""specific time of the strike"" was provided.
They added that they ""operate according to international law and take precautions to minimize civilian harm"".
In March this year, the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory made the accusation that Israel ""intentionally attacked and destroyed the Basma IVF clinic"" in a measure ""intended to prevent births among Palestinians in Gaza"".
It also alleged that Israel prevented aid, including medicines necessary to ensure safe pregnancy, childbirth, and neonatal care from reaching women.
The commission went on to claim that Israeli authorities ""destroyed in part the reproductive capacity of the Palestinians in Gaza as a groupâ¦ one of the categories of genocidal acts"".
At the time of the report, Israel's permanent mission to the UN issued a statement saying it ""categorically rejects these baseless accusations"".
And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded angrily, calling the Human Rights Council - which commissioned the report - ""an antisemitic, rotten, terrorist-supporting and irrelevant body"".
Instead of focusing on war crimes committed by Hamas, he said, it was attacking Israel with ""false accusations"".
A spokesperson for the IDF told BBC Arabic it ""does not deliberately target fertility clinics, nor does it seek to prevent the birthrate of Gaza's civilian population.
""The claim that the IDF intentionally strikes such sites is baseless and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of IDF operations in Gaza.""
Islam lost her baby and frozen embryos after the war began
Dr Ghalayini says all of Gaza's nine fertility clinics have either been destroyed or are no longer able to operate.
Noura explains that leaves her and many others with little chance of ever having a child. People like Sara Khudari, who began her fertility treatment in 2020. She was preparing for an embryo to be implanted when the war began in October 2023. The procedure never happened. ""I watched everything collapse,"" she says.
And Islam Lubbad, who Al-Basma clinic helped to conceive in 2023, a few months before the war broke out. But a month after the fighting started, she lost her baby, like Noura. ""There was no stability. We kept relocating. My body was exhausted,"" she says, recalling how she miscarried.
Islam did have more frozen embryos stored at Al-Basma Fertility Centre, but they have now been lost and there are no IVF clinics operating left for her to try to get pregnant again."

As part of a spree of more than two dozen clemency actions this week, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of a notorious Chicago street gang.
Hoover was the leader of the Gangster Disciples and in the 1990s was given six life sentences on conspiracy, extortion, drug and other criminal charges.
In addition to his federal sentence, Hoover still faces a 200-year jail term in the state of Illinois for murder, and is unlikely to be released soon. A president is unable to commute state-level sentences.
On Wednesday the president also granted a pardon to other convicts including Michael Grimm, a former New York City congressman. 

He served seven months in prison after pleading guilty to felony tax fraud.
As well as Hoover and Grimm, at least eight others have been pardoned by the president in recent days; the New York Times reported that Trump issued a total of 25 pardons or commutations of prison sentences on Wednesday. 
Department of Justice (DoJ) records indicate that during his second term Trump has pardoned more than 40 people, external, in addition to almost 1,600 pardons doled out to people charged or convicted in connection with the 6 January 2021 US Capitol riot.
During his first presidential term, Trump granted a total of 237 pardons and commutations, according to the Pew Research Center. Most of those occurred in the final month of his term.
What is a presidential pardon?
Hoover, 74, built the Gangster Disciples into a nationwide street gang from its origins on Chicago's South Side in the 1970s.
In 1973 he was convicted of ordering the execution of a rival drug dealer. Authorities allege that he continued to lead his gang from prison.
In the 1990s he formed a political organisation and claimed that he had transformed the Gangster Disciples into a community-service organisation called Growth and Development.
However, he was found guilty of a long list of federal charges in 1997.
In recent years he has advocated for criminal justice reform including the First Step Act, which Trump signed into law in 2018. Among other things, the law allows for reduced sentences for inmates who participate in programmes aimed at reducing reoffending.
Hoover has continued to publicly disavow gang life.
""I am no longer a member, leader, or even an elder statesman of the Gangster Disciples,"" Hoover wrote in a letter to a court in 2022. ""I want nothing to do with it now and forever.""
However, authorities have taken a different view, and prosecutors alleged in 2021 that he was still involved in promoting Gangster Disciples members while locked up in prison. They have argued that he is still effectively the leader of the group.
At a hearing last year, a judge asked one of Hoover's lawyers: ""How many other murders is he responsible for?""
After news broke of the commutation of his federal sentence, Hoover's lawyer Justin Moore posted online: ""We got Larry Hoover out of federal prison - when many said it was impossibleâ¦ Illinois must send him home for good.""
Grimm, the former congressman, pleaded guilty to underreporting income from a restaurant that he owned.
In addition, Trump issued pardons on Wednesday for:
Former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who was convicted on election fraud charges and sentenced to two and a half years in prison in 2015
Kentrell Gaulden, a rapper known as NBA YoungBoy, who has faced numerous drugs, weapons and fraud charges
Convicted fraudster Kevin Eric Baisden
Mark Bashaw, an army officer who was convicted in a court martial of violating Covid protection rules
Tanner Mansell and John Moore, who were convicted of theft at sea when they released sharks they thought were being illegally fished. It turned out the sharks were being legally caught for research purposes
Michael Harris, the co-founder of Death Row Records, who spent decades in prison on drug charges. Harris had his sentence commuted by Trump during his first term, and was issued a full pardon on Wednesday
On Tuesday, Trump also pardoned Todd and Julie Chrisley, two reality TV stars who were convicted of tax evasion and defrauding banks.
Also on Wednesday, Trump said he would ""take a look at"" pardoning a group of men charged with planning to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in 2020.
""I did watch the trial,"" he said. ""It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad jobâ¦ It looked to me like some people said some stupid things."""

In the latest escalation of its feud with Harvard University, the Trump administration has targeted the school's permission to enrol foreign students on visas.
The government's initially revoked Harvard's certification ""effective immediately,"" prompting a swift lawsuit from Harvard and a temporary restraining order from a federal court in Boston.
On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security appeared to walk back its initial revocation, now telling Harvard it had ""30 calendar days"" to show it was complying with the agency's visa programme requirements.
At a hearing that same morning, US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs indicated she would soon issue a broader injunction against the Trump administration while the case played out. 
The legal battle, closely watched by other US universities and the thousands of foreigners who study there. Harvard University is the most prominent academic institution to face the Trump administration's ire â and the most prominent so far to push back. 
There are two main questions at play, lawyers say. 
Do the government's reasons for targeting Harvard's participation in the student visa programme hold up under the law?
And, are those reasons legitimate, or just a pretext for punishing Harvard for constitutionally protected speech the administration dislikes?
While legal experts agree the Trump administration could lose if courts find it targeted Harvard for ideological reasons, the government has taken steps that could help it prevail â with broader, thorny implications. 
Looming over the showdown is a bigger question: Can the US government dictate what universities can teach, who they can hire, and who can enrol? 
""This could be the type of case that could, on a fast track-basis, flow from the district court to the First Circuit to the US Supreme Court,"" said Aram Gavoor, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School and a former Department of Justice attorney.
America's academic visas on which international students, researchers and faculty rely to study in the US is overseen by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, a subsidiary of the Department of Homeland Security.
To participate, universities must receive certification from DHS through the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVP). The government last week revoked Harvard's SEVP certification, gutting its ability to host international students and researchers.
""In terms of the general authority of DHS, it's quite strong. It's a certifying agency for this programme and there's a variety of bases on which decertification can take place,"" Mr Gavoor said. Courts tend to be deferential to the agency, as well.
""There are certain limits to it, though,"" he said.
The US Constitution's First Amendment, which guarantees free speech for individuals as well as corporations and entities like Harvard, is a powerful protection â and one that Harvard invoked again and again in its lawsuit.
If judges determine DHS' basis for withdrawing Harvard's certification stems from ideological differences and violates the university's free speech rights, the court could rule against the government.
""A lot will turn on whether the courts conclude whether the First Amendment is implicated here,"" Mr Gavoor said.
References to Harvard's alleged ideological leanings appear throughout the Trump administration's letters and statements - possibly problematic for the White House in court, legal experts say.
An 11 April letter ordered the university to make significant changes to its operations, including bringing in a third party ""to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint diversity.""
President Trump attacked Harvard on Truth Social for ""hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and 'birdbrains'"". A separate post called for the university to lose its tax-exempt status ""if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness'"".
In her 22 May letter to Harvard announcement about student visa eligibility, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Harvard was ""hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' policies.""
Harvard argues that the Trump administration's actions are not about combatting antisemitism or keeping Americans safe.
Revoking visa certification is ""the latest act by the government in clear retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,"" the school says in its lawsuit. It also alleges the government violated Harvard's right to due process and ignored proper procedures for taking action against it.
""The administration is making clear that they are going after Harvard on account of viewpoints it's ascribing to Harvard students and faculty and the institution itself,"" said Will Creeley, Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression legal director.
""The smoking gun is very smoky indeed, it's right out there,"" he said.
Harvard must comply with federal non-discrimination laws that bar prejudice based on race, gender, national origin, or other protected classes, but ""that doesn't mean that the federal government can dictate acceptable pedagogy in Harvard's classrooms,"" he said.
Decades of legal precedent and a critical 1957 US Supreme Court decision underpin this concept, said Mr Creeley.
Despite Harvard's argument, nuances could complicate its case.
The US historically screens prospective international students for viewpoints it deems unsafe, which could include allegedly supporting terror or totalitarian regimes. In the past, communist leanings were used to bar foreign academics from the US. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination against Jewish students.
Secretary Noem's letter to Harvard in on 22 May invokes these concepts to justify pulling certification, meaning it could ""read in a way where all that conduct is potentially unlawful"" on the university's part, Mr Gavoor said.
""The government could win here,"" he said.
Even if a judge bans the visa policy, Trump may already have won by chilling international enrollment, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an immigration attorney representing Kilmar Abrego Garcia in a high-profile deportation case.
""It's similar to self-deportation. They want people to self-unenrol,"" he said.
At the White House on Wednesday, President Trump floated the idea of capping international students at 15% of Harvard's student body.
""We have people [who] want to go to Harvard and other schools,"" he said. ""They can't get in because we have foreign students there."""

Israeli ministers say 22 new Jewish settlements have been approved in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades.
Several already exist as outposts, built without government authorisation, but will now be made legal under Israeli law. Others are completely new, according to Defence Minister Israel Katz and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
Settlements - which are widely seen as illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this - are one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
Katz said the move ""prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel"", while the Palestinian presidency called it a ""dangerous escalation"".
The Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now called it ""the most extensive move of its kind"" in more than 30 years and warned that it would ""dramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation even further"".
Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for their hoped-for future state - in the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.
Successive Israeli governments have allowed settlements to grow. However, expansion has risen sharply since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a right-wing, pro-settler coalition, as well as the start of the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.
On Thursday, Israel Katz and Bezalel Smotrich - an ultranationalist leader and settler who has control over planning in the West Bank - officially confirmed a decision that is believed to have been taken by the government two weeks ago.
A statement said they had approved 22 new settlements, the ""renewal of settlement in northern Samaria [northern West Bank], and reinforcement of the eastern axis of the State of Israel"".
It did not include information about the exact location of the new settlements, but maps being circulated suggest they will be across the length and width of the West Bank.
Katz and Smotrich did highlight what they described as the ""historic return"" to Homesh and Sa-Nur, two settlements deep in the northern West Bank which were evacuated at the same time as Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005.
Two years ago, a group of settlers established a Jewish religious school and an unauthorised outpost at Homesh, which Peace Now said would be among 12 made legal under Israeli law, external.
Nine of the settlements would be completely new, according to the watchdog. They include Mount Ebal, just to the south of Homesh and near the city of Nablus, and Beit Horon North, west of Ramallah, where it said construction had already begun in recent days.
The last of the settlements, Nofei Prat, was currently officially considered a ""neighbourhood"" of another settlement near East Jerusalem, Kfar Adumim, and would now be recognised as independent, Peace Now added.
Katz said the decision was a ""strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel, and serves as a buffer against our enemies.""
""This is a Zionist, security, and national response - and a clear decision on the future of the country,"" he added.
Smotrich called it a ""once-in-a-generation decision"" and declared: ""Next step sovereignty!""
But a spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas - who governs parts of the West Bank not under full Israeli control - called it a ""dangerous escalation"" and accused Israel of continuing to drag the region into a ""cycle of violence and instability"".
""This extremist Israeli government is trying by all means to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,"" Nabil Abu Rudeineh told Reuters news agency.
Lior Amihai, director of Peace Now, said: ""The Israeli government no longer pretends otherwise: the annexation of the occupied territories and expansion of settlements is its central goal.""
Elisha Ben Kimon, an Israeli journalist with the popular Ynet news site who covers the West Bank and settlements, told the BBC's Newshour programme that 70% to 80% of ministers wanted to declare the formal annexation of the West Bank.
""I think that Israel is a few steps from declaring this area as Israeli territory. They believe that this period will never be coming back, this is one opportunity that they don't want to slip from their hands - that's why they're doing this now,"" Mr Ben Kimon told the BBC's Newshour programme.
Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem in 1980, in a move not recognised by the vast majority of the international community.
Israeli soldiers accompanied settlers establishing the Homesh outpost in May 2023
This latest step is a blow to renewed efforts to revive momentum on a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict - the internationally approved formula for peace that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel - with a French-Saudi summit planned at the UN's headquarters in New York next month.
Jordan's foreign ministry condemned what it called a ""flagrant violation of international law"" that ""undermines prospects for peace by entrenching the occupation"".
UK Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer said the move was ""a deliberate obstacle to Palestinian statehood"".
Since taking office, the current Israeli government has decided to establish a total of 49 new settlements and begun the legalisation process for seven unauthorised outposts which will be recognised as ""neighbourhoods"" of existing settlements, according to Peace Now.
Last year, the UN's top court issued an advisory opinion that said ""Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful"". The International Court of Justice (ICJ) also said Israeli settlements ""have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law"", and that Israel should ""evacuate all settlers"".
Netanyahu said at the time that the court had made a ""decision of lies"" and insisted that ""the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land""."

A Russian book distributor has ordered bookshops to ""return or destroy"" works by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Jeffery Eugenides and the British bestseller Bridget Collins, among others, in the latest case of censorship targeting the country's literary scene.
Trading House BMM sent a letter to shops this week, seen by the BBC, with a list of 37 titles that should immediately be removed from sale.
The list also included texts by Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, Japanese novelist Ryu Murakami, and a number of Russian writers.
The order comes amid growing Kremlin censorship since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has targeted books featuring anti-war sentiment, LGBTQ themes, and criticism of Russia's leadership.
The letter warned of ""adverse consequences"" if books such as Eugenides' The Virgin Suicides and Murakami's Ecstasy were not pulled from shelves as there were suspicions they ""do not comply with Russian laws,"" without providing further details.
Booksellers should ""immediately cease sales and return [the titles] or destroy the remaining copies, providing writing confirmation of destruction"", the message said.
The targeted books are an eclectic mix.
Bridget Collins' book The Binding, about an apprentice bookbinder, features, as does An Oral History of Reggae by David Katz, along with Lisi Harrison's romance The Dirty Book Club.
The letter was signed by BMM's chief executive Anastasia Nikitanova, who hung up when the BBC approached her for comment and did not respond to further messages.
""We checked the list and we don't have these books in stock now,"" an employee of one of the shops that had received the letter told the BBC on condition of anonymity.
They continued: ""If we did, we could have tried to understand what's wrong with them. I have no idea why the publisher chose these booksâ¦ it's a sign of the moral panic that has overtaken the market.""
The newly banned books were released in Russia by the publishing houses Ripol Classic and Dom Istorii, which are affiliated with BMM.
Sergei Makarenkov, the head of Ripol Classic, said: ""I think [the list] is most likely connected to the anti-LGBT law. This needs to be clarified with BMMâ¦ I can't clearly explain to you what has happened here.""
""Such lists appear everywhere now, it's become completely routine,"" he added. Makarenkov said he would get back to the BBC when further details were available but at the time of publication had not responded to follow-up calls.
Russia banned the promotion of ""non-traditional sexual orientations"" to minors in 2013 but since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has expanded the law to forbid ""LGBT propaganda"" being disseminated among people of any ages.
Moscow has also labelled what it calls the ""international LGBT movement"" an ""extremist organisation,"" despite no such official movement existing.
The BMM letter follows a high-profile case against the publishers behind the teen romance novel A Summer in the Red Scarf and other titles with LGBT themes.
A Summer in the Red Scarf tells the story of two teenage boys who fall for each other at a Soviet pioneer camp. 
The backlash against the book prompted its two authors to leave Russia. And earlier this month, a Moscow court placed under house arrest managers from Popcorn Books and Individuum - which are part of Russia's largest publishing group, Eksmo.

""I won't sugar-coat it: it's rough. But I'm hopeful,"" she said.
""I'm being lovingly cared for by friends and family, my medical team is brilliant, and I've never felt more held by the people around me.""
Kylie Minogue was among the stars offering their support on social media.
""Sending all love,"" the Australian singer replied on Instagram, along with heart emojis.
Actor Richard E Grant also sent a string of hearts and wrote: ""WE ALL LOVE YOU SOOOOOO MUCH Mags.""
Jurassic Park star Sam Neill, who was diagnosed with a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2022, wrote to his Ride Like A Girl co-star: ""Right there with you darling xx.""
Australian actress Toni Collette added: ""Sending huge, healing love and hugs to you, dear Magda. You are supported and held in all our hearts.""
Szubanski said she was undergoing Nordic protocol treatment, a regimen which combines chemotherapy and immunotherapy to treat Mantle Cell Lymphoma.
The cancer was only discovered incidentally after she requested blood tests after feeling unwell for ""ages"".
""So the take away is - get tested and listen to your body!"" she said.
Szubanksi rose to fame playing the netball-loving Strzelecki in the early 2000s, and has been a stalwart of the comedy scene in Australia since.

A man skateboarding to Africa for charity has said that all his belongings, including his passport, have been stolen. 
Sam Allison, who is attempting to skate some 1,500 miles (1,400km) to Tangier in Morocco from Brighton, said it happened while he was camping in France. 
""I will be honest, in that moment I was pretty defeated,"" he told the BBC. ""I wanted to give up. They literally took everything.""
But, left with just his phone and wallet, Mr Allison said he was not going to let what happened stop him from continuing his estimated 55-day journey. 
""It is what it is. Life happens. There is nothing I can do about it,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram. 
""It's just sad. I am trying to do a good thing and I have had that taken from me."" 
However, Mr Allison added that being ""bare bones"" had one advantage in that it made skating much easier without the weight of his stuff. 
""In a weird way, the universe has a way of working things out. I am kinda grateful,"" he joked. 
Mr Allison said he has had to go to Bordeaux in France to get an emergency travel document and buy a new bag, tent, torch, clothes and sleeping bag. 
But he said some of the stolen items had sentimental value, such as the t-shirt he was wearing when he set off, and it was financially difficult to replace everything. 
He previously told the BBC he is doing the challenge to raise money for the Ben Raemers Foundation, a charity supporting wellbeing in the skateboarding community.

The Iranian Embassy in India has said it is investigating the case of three Indian nationals who went missing in Tehran earlier this month.
The men, all of whom are from the northern state of Punjab, had a stopover in Iran on 1 May, and were on their way to Australia, where they were promised lucrative jobs by a local travel agent. 
Their families allege that they were kidnapped upon their arrival by unknown men, who are now demanding a ransom of 5m rupees ($63,000; Â£47,000).
On Thursday, the Iranian Embassy said, external on X that it was keeping Indian authorities informed of all developments ""within the judicial system"" and warned about the dangers of taking illegal immigration routes.
""Given the nature of this incident, Indian citizens are strongly advised not to be deceived by the promises of unauthorised individuals or illegal Indian agencies offering travel to other countries,"" it said.
The statement came a day after the Indian embassy in Iran said that it had ""strongly taken up this matter with Iranian authorities"" and requested that the missing Indians be ""urgently traced and their safety ensured"".
Many Indians, particularly from Punjab, travel to developed countries in search of job opportunities and a better life.
Some fall victim to scams run by travel agents, who charge exorbitant fees and send them through illegal or unsafe routes, often without proper documentation.
Gurdeep Kaur recounted the events that led to her 23-year-old son Amritpal Singh going missing to BBC Punjabi. 
The family had hired a travel agent in Hoshiarpur - where they live - to secure an Australian work permit for her son. 
""Last month, the agent informed us that my son's visa had been approved and asked for 1.8m rupees as payment,"" she said.
""They told us they had booked a flight from Delhi to Australia on 26 April. But when my son went there, they told him that his documents were still not ready."" 
Gurdeep Kaur is urging officials to ensure her son's safe return
The agent then told Amritpal that they had rebooked him on a flight for 29 April, but later claimed that even that ticket got cancelled. 
On 1 May, the agent put Amritpal, along with the two other men, on a flight to Iran, describing it as a stopover en route to Australia, Ms Kaur said. 
After landing, Amritpal called his mum to say that he had arrived safely and that a cab was on its way to take them to a hotel, before their next flight. 
But an hour later, Ms Kaur said her son called again, this time to say that he had been kidnapped. 
Before she could get any details, the call got cut abruptly and her son became unreachable. 
Ms Kaur said that the family tried to contact the three agents in Punjab - they first gave them ""vague responses"" and then went missing. The next day, the family found that their homes and offices were locked. 
Ms Kaur said they began receiving video calls from unknown men around the same time. 
On the call, Ms Kaur alleged the kidnappers would show Amritpal and the two other men held hostage inside a room. They had injuries all over their body from being beaten up, she alleged. 
At first, they demanded 20mn rupees but eventually reduced the amount, settling at 5.4m rupees, Ms Kaur said. 
""But it has been more than 10 days days since we last heard from them,"" said Gurdev Singh, Amritpal's uncle. The family has not paid any ransom till now. 
A police complaint has since been filed against the travel agents and an investigation is under way.
""The search for the three men is on. They are on the run, but we are conducting searches,""  Gursahib Singh, an officer with Hoshiarpur police, told BBC Punjabi. 
Meanwhile, around 150km (93 miles) away, in Dhuri village, the house of Husanpreet Singh, one of the other missing men, remains locked. 
He lived there with his maternal grandmother, who is now busy going door-to-door to her relatives, asking them for help. 
The Indian embassy in Tehran has said it was keeping the families informed of all developments.
India has recently intensified its crackdown on travel agents involved in illegal immigration, particularly after hundreds of undocumented Indians were deported from the US after President Donald Trump took office for a second term.
Images of these migrants in chains, disembarking from an American aircraft, had made headlines for weeks.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the move would include ""those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields"".
Relations between Beijing and Washington have plummeted in recent months as a tit-for-tat trade war erupted between the two superpowers sparked by Trump's tariffs.
There were an estimated 280,000 Chinese students studying in the US last year. It is not clear how many of them could be affected by the latest move.
China said it ""firmly opposes"" the move, and urged the US to pursue more constructive relations. 
As part of the plan, criteria will also be revised to ""enhance scrutiny"" of future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong, Rubio added in his statement on Wednesday.
Chinese nationals used to account for the bulk of  international students enrolled at American universities, though that has recently changed. 
From pandemic-era restrictions to worsening relations between the two countries, their number has dropped in recent years, according to US state department data, external. 
On Monday, Rubio, who is America's top diplomat, also ordered US embassies around the world to stop scheduling appointments for student visas as the state department prepares to expand social media vetting of such applicants.
That move, too, was opposed by China.
Rubio said in Wednesday's statement: ""Under President Trump's leadership, the US State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. 
""We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.""
The Trump administration has already moved to deport a number of foreign students, while revoking thousands of visas for others. Many of these actions have been blocked by the courts.
It has also frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for universities. The president sees some of America's most elite institutions, such as Harvard, as too liberal and accuses them of failing to combat antisemitism on campus.
Many US universities rely on foreign students for a significant chunk of their funding - as those scholars often pay higher tuition fees.
Students say they 'regret' applying to US schools after visa changes
Are you a student affected by the issues in this story? Tell us here
A number of international students have been reeling from the planned visa changes. 
Some told the BBC they wished they had never opted to study in the US. 
""I already regret it,"" said a 22-year-old master's student from Shanghai, who did not want to be named for fear of jeopardising a visa to study at the University of Pennsylvania.
Beijing has not yet responded to the US move to revoke the visas of Chinese students specifically.
But China responded earlier on Wednesday to the Trump administration's move to cancel student visa appointments globally. 
""We urge the US side to earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of international students, including those from China,"" an official was quoted as saying.
An official memo, reviewed by the BBC's US partner CBS News, on Tuesday instructed US embassies across the world to remove all open appointments for students seeking visas, but to keep already-scheduled appointments in place.
Last week, a judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's attempt to strip Harvard of its ability to enrol international students. 
The ruling came after America's oldest university filed a lawsuit against the administration. The White House accused the judge hearing the case of having a ""liberal agenda"". 
On Wednesday, Harvard said in a court filing that revoking its certification to host international students could inflict irreparable harm on the university.
In a declaration filed with the court motion, Harvard international office director Maureen Martin said the move was causing ""significant emotional distress"" for students and scholars. 
She wrote that students were skipping graduation ceremonies, cancelling international travel and in some cases seeking transfer to other colleges. 
Some had also reported fears of being forced to return to countries where they face active conflict or political persecution, according to the court filing."

India's first ever silent feature film - Raja Harishchandra - in 1913, was made with Marathi language title cards. Over the past few decades, though, Marathi cinema lost its way, overshadowed by Hindi films from Bollywood. But could a revival be in sight?
The critically acclaimed Marathi language drama Sthal (A Match) opens with a striking role reversal: instead of the bride, it's the prospective groom who endures the dehumanising ritual of being scrutinised for an arranged marriage.
But we soon learn it's Savita, the film's protagonist, waking from an impossible dream - her real life, like that of many Indian women caught in the tradition of arranged marriage, is the exact opposite.
Sthal offers an unsparing look at the grim side of arranged marriage in Indiaâoften romanticised on screen with song and dance. It's also part of a wave of Marathi films earning global acclaim this year.
Sabar Bonda, a semi-personal rural romance between two men, made history as the first Marathi film to screen at Sundanceâand won a Grand Jury Prize. 
Meenakshi Shedde, a senior programme advisor for South Asian films at the Toronto International Film Festival, called it ""a daring, exquisite rural gay romance"", and its bold, tender storytelling ""historic"". 
Sabar Bonda (Cactus Pears) became the first ever Marathi film to screen at Sundance and win a Grand Jury Prize
Once pioneers of Indian cinema, Marathi films have long been hurt by Bollywood's dominating influence in the state of Maharashtra - where the language is spoken - and elsewhere in the country. But in the past decade, they've been quietly making a global mark, with diverse, acclaimed titles lighting up international festivals.
Nagraj Manjule's romantic-tragedy Sairat was picked up for Berlinale in 2016. A few years later, Chaitanya Tamhane's The Disciple became the first Indian film to screen in Venice since Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding - Oscar-winner Afonso Cuaron came on-board as its executive producer.
At least a dozen other independent and experimental Marathi films have since found a spot at global festivals, handling an impressive diversity of subjects.
Harshad Nalawade's Follower, which was selected for the Rotterdam Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release for instance, dives into the radicalisation of India's youth, exploring the life of a small-town troll with compassion.
In Second Chance, a black-and-white debut by Subhadra Mahajan, a woman's post-trauma journey leads her to the Himalayas. Premiered at Busan, it hits Indian theatres this June.
With strong roots in Marathi literature and theatre, including experimental theatre, Marathi cinema has always produced strong films, Shedde says.
Many of the independent films offer ""quiet spaces for reflection"" she adds, unlike the bombastic commercial appeal of Bollywood.
The aesthetics of this cinema reflect the often marginal backgrounds of its makers - many are self-taught and outside traditional power circles.
Take Sabar Bonda director Rohan Kanawade, for instance - he grew up in Mumbai's slums but dared to dream of making films.
""This brings a rich, unschooled, rawness and lived experience to their cinema. They are very different from the smooth universal polish of films that tend to come out of international script labs and international co-productions,"" Shedde says.
Oscar-winner Afonso Cuaron was executive producer of The Disciple which won best screenplay at Venice in 2020
But unlike the steady stream of content from other regional cinema - such as Malayalam films from Kerala - Marathi films still emerge in bursts. 
That's partly because there's no institutional support, says Shefali Bhushan, Sthal's producer, who, along with three other partners, put their own money to finance the film.
The big studios don't pick-up Marathi projects without an ""obvious commercial appeal"", which means an ecosystem supportive of experimental artistic voices is sorely lacking, she adds.
Unlike Kerala, Maharashtra also offers little state support for regional cinema and lacks a strong movie-going culture.
Being centred mainly around the cities of Mumbai and Pune, Marathi films ""feel the full, suffocating weight of Bollywood, that other regional cinemas don't"", says  Shedde.
Besides, Maharashtra does not have Kerala's highly ""cine-literate audience"" where ""rice farmers discuss [legendary filmmaker Sergei] Eisenstein and his legacy"", giving those filmmakers confidence that their small indie film can recover costs and make money, she adds. 
The Marathi film industry lacks institutional support, says Shefali Bhushan, one of the producers for Sthal
The makers are also to be partially blamed, says veteran film critic Ashok Rane, who was tasked by the state government to market the region's films at Cannes in the last decade.
They've done little to explore subjects that ""speak a universal language"" and would appeal to the global audience, Rane told the BBC.
Shedde says the industry's growth has also been stymied by the ""lack of aggressive ambition"" and the absence of a film distribution system meant that, for decades, India was the ""graveyard of good cinema"".
However, she believes international recognition at festivals such as Sundance and Cannes will help to address this â especially for Indie filmmakers wanting to expand to non-traditional markets. 
Bhushan agrees - the chance to show her film at Cannes, facilitated by the Maharashtra government, has opened new doors.
She says the festivals are ""a chance to learn how to make sales to different territories, mount new projects as co-productions with people [from around the globle]"". 
""There's a whole world waiting to be tapped.""
This report described Raja Harishchandra as the first film made in the Marathi language, and said The Disciple won the best screenplay award at Venice. These inaccuracies have been corrected.

The move has thrown the world economy into chaos and critics have argued that tariffs will make products more expensive for US consumers.
On 28 May, a US court blocked Trump's sweeping policy, ruling that he did not have the authority to impose the taxes on nearly every country. The White House has lodged an appeal. 
US trade court blocks Trump's sweeping tariffs. What happens now?
Tariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries.
Typically, they are a percentage of a product's value. 
A 10% tariff means a $10 product would have a $1 tax on top - taking the total cost to $11 (Â£8.35).
Companies that bring foreign goods into the US have to pay the tax to the government. 
They may pass some or all of the extra cost on to customers. Firms may also decide to import fewer goods.
Trump says tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment.
He wants to reduce the gap between the value of goods the US buys from other countries and those it sells to them. He argues that America has been taken advantage of by ""cheaters"" and ""pillaged"" by foreigners.
The US president has made other demands alongside tariffs. 
When he announced the first tariffs of his current term against China, Mexico and Canada, he said he wanted them to do more to stop migrants and illegal drugs reaching the US. 
European Union:
Trump has said he is recommending a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union being imported to the United States.
He initially proposed a 20% tariff on most EU goods, but halved it to 10% until 8 July to allow time for talks.
""Our discussions with them are going nowhere!"" he wrote in a post on social media on Friday. He said the new tariffs would kick in on 1 June.
China: 
The US and China ramped up huge tariffs against one another in recent months, but have now reached an agreement for significant reductions.  
Trump unveiled a 10% tariff on goods from China on 4 February, which doubled to 20% a month later.
On 2 April, Trump announced a universal 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the US, on what he called ""Liberation Day"". But some nations, including China, were subjected to higher rates.
China retaliated with tariffs of its own, and the ratcheting up of taxes ultimately led to the US imposing a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, on 9 April. 
Beijing had a 125% levy on some US goods.
However, the US and China have now both suspended all but 10% of their Liberation Day tariffs for 90 days, starting on 14 May. They have cancelled other retaliatory levies.
This will cut US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US imports will be reduced to 10%.
The US measures still include 20% aimed at putting pressure on Beijing to do more to curb the illegal trade in fentanyl, a powerful opioid drug. 
Canada and Mexico: 
Canada and Mexico were also targeted by Trump in February, when he introduced a 25% tax on imports from both countries and a 10% levy on Canadian energy.
There have been a number of delays and exemptions to these tariffs.
In response, Canada introduced a 25% tax on some vehicles imported from the US on 9 April. 
Steel and aluminium: 
A 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - including products made from these metals - took effect on 12 March.
Cars:
Since 2 April, foreign-made cars have faced a 25% levy. This was extended to cover imported engines and other car parts on 3 May. 
On 29 April, Trump softened the rules to reduce the effect on US car companies. 
10% 'baseline' and higher tariffs:
On 2 April, Trump announced most countries - including the UK - would face a 10% ""baseline"" tariff on all goods sent to the US.
On 9 April, he unveiled a range of much higher tariffs for about 60 countries, described as the ""worst offenders"" among America's trading partners.
Hours later he announced a 90-day pause, during which the 10% ""baseline"" rate would be paid by all named countries apart from China. 
In response, many countries are working on retaliatory measures.
Smartphones and computers:
An exemption for some electronic devices from China and elsewhere - including smartphones and computers - was announced on 12 April. 
Trump later warned the concession could be short lived.
On 23 May, the president threatened to impose a 25% import tax ""at least"" on Apple iPhones not manufactured in America.
Films:
On 4 May, Trump said he wanted to introduce a 100% tariff on foreign films to boost the US movie industry. 
See the Trump tariffs list by country
BBC Verify: How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?
The UK and the US have reached a narrow agreement over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries.
The UK exported about Â£58bn of goods to the US in 2024, external, mainly cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals.
The blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world still applies to most UK goods.
But the deal means there are some exemptions to tariffs being applied to other countries.
The additional 25% import tax the US had placed on cars has now been cut to 10% for a maximum 100,000 UK cars - about the number the UK exported last year.
A 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US that came into effect in March has also been scrapped for the UK.
There will be a quota for how much steel can be exported, although it is currently unclear how much this will cover. 
In return, the UK has scrapped a 20% tariff on US beef and raised the quota from 1,000 to 13,000 metric tonnes. The UK has said there will be no weakening of food standards on beef.
Trump deal is a significant achievement for Starmer
What is in the UK-US tariff deal?
Trump's various announcements have caused volatility on global stock markets, where firms sell shares in their business. Many people are affected by stock market price changes, even if they don't invest in shares directly, because of the knock-on effect on pensions, jobs and interest rates.
The value of the US dollar, usually considered a safe asset, has also fallen in recent months.
How does it affect me if share prices fall?
Why does it matter if the US dollar falls?
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its prediction for global economic growth in 2025 as a result of the tariffs. 
It expects America to be hardest hit, and says a US recession is now more likely in 2025. 
As Trump marked 100 days in power, the commerce department said the US economy shrank in the first three months of 2025, after strong growth in the previous quarter. 
The president insists his policy is working, but influential voices within his own Republican Party have joined opposition Democrats and foreign leaders in attacking the measures.
Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?
In Depth: There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs
Price increases are expected across a range of imported goods, as businesses pass on some or all of their higher costs. 
Adidas and Barbie maker Mattel are among the global firms which have said they will charge American customers more. 
Some companies may also decide to import fewer foreign goods, which could make those that are available more expensive.
The costs of goods manufactured in the US using imported components are also expected to rise. 
For example, car parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.
The new tariffs have also resulted in tighter customs checks at the US border, leading to delays."

Social media posts from residents of Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital have shown an abundance of rodents swimming in the Miljacka river which flows through the centre of the city.
Sarajevans long accustomed to poor public services have also posted photos of overflowing rubbish containers and illegal dumping â along with complaints that the authorities have failed to clear away dead animals from public areas including children's playgrounds.
It all makes for a wonderful environment for rats to thrive. For humans, however, the picture is rather less rosy.
Health experts blame a failure to control Sarajevo's rodent population for an alarming rise in the number of cases of rat-borne diseases. 
In just one 24 hour period this week, the country's largest hospital reported a dozen cases of leptospirosis. That follows a steady stream of other infections earlier in the month.
One of the disease's nicknames, rat fever, reflects its key vector of infection. It generally spreads to humans through water or soil contaminated with rodent urine or faeces.
Symptoms can range from headaches and muscle pain to bleeding on the lungs. The acute form of the illness, Weil's disease, can cause jaundice and even kidney failure.
The local authorities in Sarajevo have declared an epidemic, allowing the imposition of emergency measures, including a long overdue clean-up.
Extra municipal workers armed with disinfectant sprays have been deployed to carry out an urban ""spring clean"" in public areas across the city, while additional rubbish collections are being arranged. Schools have been directed to clean their playgrounds, mow any grass areas and check their basements for rats.
The current all-action approach is a stark contrast to the laissez-faire situation of the past two years, during which there were no pest control measures in Sarajevo at all. Officials blame a botched tender process for extermination and sanitation work, which has allowed the city to go to the rats â and, for that matter, the dogs, as packs of strays are also a common sight around the capital.
Sarajevo Canton Health Minister Enis Hasanovic described the situation as ""not a health crisis, but a communal crisis"", due to local authorities failing to fulfil essential municipal hygiene requirements.
But a former director of the Sarajevo's University Clinical Centre, Sebija IzetbegoviÄ, believes the health situation could deteriorate further. Now a member of Sarajevo Canton Assembly, she points out that ""well-fed rats"" are currently so numerous in the city that ""we can also expect hantavirus"".
In one respect at least, Sarajevo has been lucky. Left untreated, leptospirosis can be deadly, with a mortality rate of more than 50% for people who suffer from severe bleeding of the lungs.
But so far none of the cases reported in the current epidemic have been serious."

The pair met on the set of the Australian TV show Corelli in 1995, shortly after Jackman had left drama school.
They married the following year and later adopted two children.
Since Furness issued the statement, Jackman, currently performing in New York, posted a video to Instagram in which he is skipping to the NSYNC song Bye Bye Bye."

Chile is the world's second-largest exporter of farmed salmon, and the biggest supplier to the US. In the south of the country a dispute continues over the large number of salmon farms that are located in supposedly protected areas.
The port city of Puerto Montt, more than 1,000km (600 miles) south of Chile's capital Santiago, is at the heart of the country's farmed Atlantic salmon industry.
At a processing facility on the outskirts of town workers kitted out in white suits, hairnets, facemasks, and blue plastic gloves and boots prepare fresh and smoked salmon for export to the US and Japan.
In a spacious meeting room, Fracisco Lobos, the chief corporate officer for the plant's owner â salmon-exporter Multi X â explains how farming the fish has transformed the south of Chile.
""Salmon's been part of this region's industrial revolution,"" he says. ""There used to be a lot of poverty in the region, and now many people earn more than in other parts of Chile.
""Because of the industry a lot of support services have sprung up, which benefit the families living here, and people have moved here from other parts of the country for work.""
Atlantic salmon are not native to Chile. Instead, eggs were brought over to Chile from the UK at the end of the 19th Century and released into rivers, lakes and the sea to grow into fish for recreational fishing.
Farming the fish in netted, offshore pens then started in the 1970s, before growing substantially ever since. There were 1,343 active salmon farms across southern Chile at the end of last year.
In 2024 as a whole, Chile exported 782,076 tonnes of salmon and trout, according to the latest annual figures from the Chile's National Customs Service. The vast majority of this is salmon, but the two fish are counted together in the official data.
This was worth $6.4bn (Â£4.8bn), making it Chile's third-biggest export after copper in first place and fresh fruit. It also means that Chile's salmon exports are only surpassed by Norway's.
Salmon is the third-highest value export for Chile
Some 86,000 people now work directly or indirectly for Chile's farmed salmon industry, according to trade body SalmÃ³n Chile. The farms stretch from the BiobÃ­o region, which is around 500km south of Santiago, right down to the Magallanes region in the far Patagonian south of the country, and more than 2,000km away from the capital.
With global demand for farmed salmon due to grow by 40%, external by 2033, according to one report, Chilean producers are keen to increase their production. However, it actually fell slightly last year.
SalmÃ³n Chile's chairman, Arturo Clements, says the government needs to do more to help the industry expand.
""For us it's been very difficult to grow, because we have too many regulations, and we have too many conflicts regarding the use of the sea,"" he says. ""What we need is to define a long-term strategy regarding salmon farming.""
Much of the conflict concerns the locations of many of the fish farms, which critics say are highly polluting.
More specifically, there are 408 salmon farming concessions â licenses granted by the government that allow a company to operate a salmon farm in a specific area â within supposedly environmentally protected areas in Chile.
These include 294 in national reserves, where limited commercial use of natural resources is allowed., external And 29 in the more strictly controlled national parks, where business operations are officially not supposed to be permitted.
Flavia Liberona is the executive director of Terram, a foundation that promotes sustainable development. In her hot and sticky office in an old building in the centre of Santiago she describes an environmental campaign that she's part of â Salvemos La Patagonia or Save Patagonia.
It wants to protect the natural habitat of the entire Chilean Patagonia region. This vast geographic area starts north of Puerto Montt and then extends all the way down to the very base of the country. And it is where most of the salmon farms are located, in its many fjords.
""We want the salmon farms to stop operating in the national parks and national reserves,"" says Ms Liberona.
""The salmon farming causes various environmental problems. One is that the fish are kept in cages and fed with pellets.
""A lot of the pellets and fish faeces end up on the seabed and that leads to less oxygen which kills the sea life in the ocean underneath the cages, and depending on the current, elsewhere in the sea.""
Government licences exist for 29 salmon farms in Chilean national parks
When these concerns are put to Mr Clement from SalmÃ³n Chile, he explains that there are different categories for the salmon farming concessions.
""In terms of concessions in the national parks we have 21 that we aren't using,"" he says. ""We have told the government that we don't want to be there and asked to be relocated but nothing has happened for many years.""
Regarding salmon farming in national reserves, he says that is a different environment which, according to Chilean law and the rules and regulations they follow, they can operate in.
In Chile, the salmon industry is regulated by The Undersecretariat for Fisheries and Aquaculture, a public body that is part of the Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism.
It looks at environmental protection and sustainability, and is also working on a new general aquaculture law to further regulate the sector.
Julio Salas GutiÃ©rrez, the Chilean Undersecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture, tells the BBC that the government is working to remove fish farms from the national parks.
""It's not right to claim that the government 'has done nothing for years' regarding the relocation of concessions outside of national parks,"" he says. ""Under the current administration, efforts have been made not only to understand the problem, but also to advance it.
""The relocation process itself is usually quite complex, bureaucratic, and takes a considerable number of years, considering the difficulty of relocating these concessions to new areas suitable for aquaculture.""
Matt Craze is the founder of UK and Chile-based Spheric Research, which studies global seafood markets. He says that Chile's salmon industry would invest more money ""if they felt that there was a better regulatory framework, and the government gave some certainty about the areas where they can farm"".
Yet with a general election due in Chile later this year, the uncertainty may continue at least in the short term."

Two men have been sentenced for their role in the deaths of a family from India who froze during a blizzard while trying to cross into the US from Canada.
Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel and Steve Anthony Shand were convicted last November of human trafficking, criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
In court in the US state of Minnesota, Patel was sentenced to just over 10 years in prison. Shand was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison. The custodial terms were about half of what prosecutors had sought.
The bodies of Jagdish Patel, 39, his wife Vaishaliben, 37, and their two children, 11-year-old Vihangi and three-year-old Dharmik, were found in January 2022.
Authorities said the couple, both schoolteachers, and their children were trying to cross into the US when they were caught in a blizzard, with temperatures as low as -38C (-36F).
The family had travelled from their home village in the western Indian state of Gujarat to Toronto.
Prosecutors said the Patels became separated from a larger group of people who were being smuggled.
The family was found in a field in the province of Manitoba by Canadian authorities, just 12m (39ft) from the US border.
Investigators said the group had been walking for hours in the freezing cold and were discovered after Shand was stopped by police on the US side of the border.
Harshkumar Ramanlal Patel, an Indian national, was not related to the family. 
Prosecutors said he was a human trafficker known as ""Dirty Harry"" and oversaw a large-scale operation that brought other Indian nationals to Canada on student visas, then smuggled them south.
Shand, a US citizen from Florida, was set to pick up the migrants after they crossed the border before driving them to Chicago.
At the trial in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, US prosecutor Michael McBride argued that while members of the Patel family were ""slowly dying in the freezing cold, Steve Shand sat in his warm van"" on the Minnesota side.
""Harshkumar Patel texted from sunny Florida and did nothing to help,"" Mr McBride said.
""For weeks, they knew the cold would kill, but they decided their profit was more important than these human lives,"" he told the court.
Among the trial witnesses was Rajinder Pal Singh, a convicted human smuggler who helped move people across the border between British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, and the north-western US state of Washington.
Acting US Attorney Lisa Kirkpatrick said in a statement after the sentencing: ""Every time I think about this case I think about this family - including two beautiful little children - who the defendants left to freeze to death in a blizzard.  
""As we've seen time and time again, human traffickers care nothing for humanity.""
In 2022, neighbours from the Patels' home village told the BBC that it was common for families in the area to attempt to move to North America in pursuit of better economic opportunities."

An undocumented US immigrant has been arrested after he sent a handwritten letter to the government saying he planned to assassinate President Donald Trump, officials said.
The man, 54-year-old Ramon Morales-Reyes, said in the letter he would ""shoot your precious president in is [sic] head"" before self-deporting back to his native country of Mexico. 
He is now in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention in Wisconsin with deportation proceedings pending, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said.
Mr Morales-Reyes had a criminal record including multiple arrests and attempts to enter the US illegally, the DHS said. The BBC could not find a lawyer for Mr Morales-Reyes to comment.
""Thanks to our ICE officers, this illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump is behind bars,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.
Homeland security officials said authorities received the letter from Mr Morales-Reyes on 21 May.
They included a copy of the letter in a press release. Written in blue ink on lined-paper, the letter said: ""We are tired of this president messing with us Mexicans.""
""You have been deporting my family and I think it is time Donald J. Trump gets what he has coming to him."" 
The final line of the letter said: ""I will see him at one of his big rallies.""
Mr Morales-Reyes was arrested a day after the letter was received. According to officials, he had attempted to enter the US illegally nine times between 1998 and 2005, and had been arrested for a felony hit and run.
A copy of the handwritten letter mailed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials
After vowing to use the US military to carry out mass deportations during his election campaign, Trump's administration has aggressively pursued undocumented migrants. 
Mr Morales-Reyes' mention of self-deporting in his letter appears to be a reference to a DHS announcement of $1,000 (Â£751) bonuses and paid travel for people who leave the US voluntarily.
Some of Trump's methods, including using the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants his administration accuses of gang activity, have been blocked by the courts.
He's also called for an additional 20,000 DHS officers to enforce his deportation policies. 
In her statement, Noem noted that this latest threat against President Trump comes less than a year after a gunman attempted to assassinate him at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. 
She also referenced a recent social media post by former FBI Director James Comey in which he posted images of sea shells on a beach spelling '8-6-4-7'. The message was interpreted by some as a call to assassinate Trump, the 47th president. Comey denied the allegations and took down the post. 
""All politicians and members of the media should take notice of these repeated attempts on President Trump's life and tone down their rhetoric,"" Noem said."

Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has told Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky that Berlin will help Kyiv produce long-range weapons to defend itself from Russian attack.
""We want to talk about production and we will not publicly discuss details,"" he said, when asked by reporters in Berlin if Germany would supply Kyiv with its Taurus missiles.
Merz took office earlier this month, promising to beef up German support for Ukraine, and said this week that there were ""no longer"" any range restrictions on weapons supplied by Kyiv's Western allies.
For weeks there has been speculation that Merz will allow the deployment of German-made Taurus missiles, which have a range of 500km (310 miles) and could reach deeper into Russian territory than other far-range weapons.
Merz did not refer to the Taurus during his press conference with the Ukrainian leader, and German newspaper Spiegel said later that the systems being developed by Ukraine were not as sophisticated as Taurus but had the advantage of being easier to operate.
Germany's defence ministry said in a statement that Berlin would finance the production of long-range weapons systems in Ukraine and that the ""first of these systems could be deployed in the Ukrainian armed forces in just a few weeks"".
The Kremlin has warned that any decision to end range restrictions on the missiles that Ukraine can use would be a quite dangerous change in policy that would harm efforts to reach a political deal. 
However, Merz has since emphasised that a decision on lifting range restrictions was taken by Western allies months ago.
The new chancellor is seeking to cut a far more assertive figure on support for Ukraine than his predecessor, Olaf Scholz.
So far, he is succeeding.
There may be many questions about the detail of Merz's missile co-operation plan but his willingness to make big announcements that might antagonise the Kremlin stands in stark contrast to the cautious tone of the last government.
During his press conference with Zelensky, Merz promised Ukraine continued support for as long as necessary, warning Moscow that its refusal to take part in further peace talks would have ""real consequences"".
Zelensky has called for talks aimed at reaching a settlement on the war to involve three leaders - ""Trump-Putin-me"" - although he added he was ready for any format.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not dismiss the idea out of hand but said such a meeting could only take place after ""concrete agreements"" had been reached between ""the two delegations.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of delaying the peace process
Although Ukraine and Russia held their first direct talks for more than three years in Istanbul earlier this month, the meeting involved low-level officials and they were only able to agree on a prisoner exchange, which took place last weekend.
On Wednesday, however, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow is indeed ready to hold a second round of peace talks with Kyiv.
According to a statement posted on state news agency Tass, he said the next round of talks could take place on 2 June in Istanbul where Russia would present a ""memorandum"" outlining its peace terms.
""We hope that all those who are sincerely, and not just in words, interested in the success of the peace process will support holding a new round of direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations,"" Lavrov said.
Lavrov added he had briefed US counterpart Marco Rubio on the proposal.
Lavrov had also previously made clear that Moscow was looking to guarantee Ukraine's ""neutral, non-aligned and non-nuclear status"".
Ukraine said they were not opposed to further meetings but ""the next meeting must yield results"". 
In a post on X, Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov said the country had already submitted its peace terms to Russia and demanded Moscow do the same.
US President Donald Trump indicated this week that his patience was wearing thin with Russia's failure to move forward with further talks.
He accused Vladimir Putin of ""playing with fire"", after a deadly Russian missile strike that killed 13 Ukrainians, including children. However, Russian officials suggested that Trump was not sufficiently informed on the context of the conflict.
Ukraine's president has urged Washington to impose sanctions on Russia's banking and energy sectors. He said he had discussed the issue with Trump, adding that the US president had ""confirmed that if Russia does not stop, sanctions will be imposed"".
Despite the continued diplomatic manoeuvres, Ukraine's military reported one of its largest drone barrages on Russian targets to date overnight in to Wednesday, while Zelensky said Russia had launched more than 900 drones over a three-day period ending early on Monday morning.
On the ground, Ukraine's defences have come under increased Russian attack in the northeast.
Zelensky said Moscow was ""amassing"" over 50,000 troops along the Sumy front, where Russian forces have seized several villages across the Ukrainian border in an effort to create what Putin calls ""security buffer zones"".
Sumy governor Oleh Hryhorov said Russian forces had seized four villages and that fighting was continuing near other settlements in the area.
The war, now into its fourth year, has claimed tens of thousands of lives and left much of Ukraine's east and south in ruins. Moscow controls roughly one-fifth of the country's territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.
Zelensky has accused Moscow of delaying the peace process and said they are yet to deliver a promised memorandum of peace terms following talks in Istanbul. Peskov insisted the document was in its ""final stages."""

Students around the world are anxious and in limbo, they say, as the Trump administration makes plans to temporarily halt US student visa appointments.
An official memo seen by BBC's US partner CBS ordered a temporary pause in appointments as the state department prepares to increase social media vetting of applicants for student and foreign exchange visas.
It is part of a wide-ranging crackdown by US President Donald Trump on some of America's most elite universities, which he sees as overly liberal.
For students, the changes have brought widespread uncertainty, with visa appointments at US embassies now unavailable and delays that could leave scholarships up in the air. 
Some students told the BBC that the confusion has even left them wishing they had applied to schools outside the US.
""I already regret it,"" said a 22-year-old master's student from Shanghai, who did not wish to be named for fear of jeopardising their visa to study at the University of Pennsylvania.
The student said they feel lucky their application was approved, but that has not eased their uncertainty. 
""Even if I study in the US, I may be chased back to China without getting my degree,"" they said. ""That's so scary.""
Asked about the decision to pause all student visa appointments, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday: ""We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.""
As part of his wider crackdown on higher education, Trump has moved to ban Harvard from enrolling international students, accusing the school of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.
Harvard filed a lawsuit in response, and a judge has halted Trump's ban for now, with a hearing on the matter scheduled for 29 May.
A student from Guangzhou City, who runs a consultancy group for Chinese students wishing to study in the US, said they are not sure how to advise applicants because the rules keep changing.
The student, who also wished not to be named, added that they think there will be fewer students who see the US as a viable education option.
Ainul Hussein from India says he risks losing his scholarship if he has to defer his studies 
More than 1.1 million international students from over 210 countries were enrolled in US colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to Open Doors, an organisation that collects data on foreign students.
Universities often charge these international students higher tuition fees - a crucial part of their operating budgets.
For Ainul Hussein, 24, from India, the visa implications are both financial and personal.
Mr Hussein said he was excited to begin the next chapter of his life in New Jersey, enrolled in a master's of science programme in management.
He received a I-20 document from the university - a crucial piece of paper that allows him to apply for a US student visa. 
But recent processing delays left him ""deeply worried"", he said, with appointments at consulates now either postponed or unavailable.
Foreign students who want to study in the US usually must schedule interviews at a US embassy in their home country before approval.
He said he may be forced to book flights to the US, still unsure of the situation. He also risks losing his scholarship if he has to defer his studies. 
Oliver Cropley, from the UK, is worried about his student visa
Students in the UK are being affected, too. 
Oliver Cropley, a 27-year-old from Norwich, said he was due to study abroad for a year in Kansas, but that plan is now in jeopardy.
""Currently I've no student visa, despite forking out Â£300 on the application process,"" Mr Cropley said.
News of the US pausing visa applications is ""a huge disappointment"". 
He, too, risks losing a scholarship if he is unable to complete his study abroad in the US, and may have to find last-minute accommodation and liaise with the university to make sure it does not delay him academically. 
Alfred Williamson, from Wales, told Reuters he was excited to travel after his first year at Harvard, but couldn't wait to get back. But now, he hasn't heard about his visa. 
It's ""dehumanising"", he told Reuters.
""We're being used like pawns in the game that we have no control of, and we're being caught in this crossfire between the White House and Harvard,"" Mr Williamson told the news agency.

His work spanned roughly six decades, primarily documenting the transformation of his country - Kenya - from a colonial subject to a democracy.
NgÅ©gÄ© was tipped to win the Nobel Prize for Literature countless times, leaving fans dismayed each time the medal slipped through his fingers.
He will be remembered not only as a Nobel-worthy writer, but also as a fierce proponent of literature written in native African languages.
NgÅ©gÄ© was born James Thiongâo NgÅ©gÄ© in 1938, when Kenya was under British colonial rule. He grew up in the town of Limuru among a large family of low-income agricultural workers.
His parents scrimped and saved to pay for his tuition at Alliance, a boarding school run by British missionaries.
In an interview, external, NgÅ©gÄ© recalled returning home from Alliance at the end of term to find his entire village had been razed by the colonial authorities.
His family members were among the hundreds and thousands forced to live in detention camps during a crackdown on the Mau Mau, a movement of independence fighters.
The Mau Mau uprising, which lasted from 1952 to 1960, touched NgÅ©gÄ©'s life in numerous, devastating ways. 
In one of the most crushing, NgÅ©gÄ©'s brother, Gitogo, was fatally shot in the back for refusing to comply with a British soldier's command. 
Gitogo had not heard the command because he was deaf. 
Kenyans were frequently interrogated under suspicion of being Mau Mau rebels
In 1959, as the British struggled to maintain their grip on Kenya, NgÅ©gÄ© left to study in Uganda. He enrolled at Makerere University, which remains one of Africa's most prestigious universities.
During a writers' conference at Makerere, NgÅ©gÄ© shared the manuscript for his debut novel with revered Nigerian author Chinua Achebe.
Achebe forwarded the manuscript to his publisher in the UK and the book, named Weep Not, Child, was released to critical acclaim in 1964. It was the first major English-language novel to be written by an East African.
NgÅ©gÄ© swiftly followed up with two more popular novels, A Grain of Wheat and The River Between. In 1972, the UK's Times newspaper said NgÅ©gÄ©, then aged 33, was ""accepted as one of Africa's outstanding contemporary writers"". 
Then came 1977 - a period that marked a huge change in NgÅ©gÄ©'s life and career. For starters, this was the year he became NgÅ©gÄ© wa Thiong'o and shed his birth name, James. NgÅ©gÄ© made the change as he wanted a name free of colonial influence.
He also dropped English as the primary language for his literature and vowed to only write in his mother tongue, Kikuyu.
He published his last English language novel, Petals of Blood, in 1977.
NgÅ©gÄ©'s previous books had been critical of the colonial state, but Petals of Blood attacked the new leaders of independent Kenya, portraying them as an elite class who had betrayed ordinary Kenyans.
NgÅ©gÄ© didn't stop there. The same year, he co-wrote the play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want), which was a searing look at Kenya's class struggle. 
Its theatre run was shut down by the government of then President Jomo Kenyatta and NgÅ©gÄ© was locked up in a maximum security jail for a year without trial.
It was a fruitful 12 months, however - as NgÅ©gÄ© wrote his first Kikuyu novel, Devil on the Cross, while in prison. It is said he used toilet paper to write the entire book, as he did not have access to a notebook.
Wa Thiong'o's second wife Njeeri worked with him at the University of California
NgÅ©gÄ© was released after Daniel arap Moi replaced Mr Kenyatta as president.
NgÅ©gÄ© said that four years later, while in London for a book launch, he learnt there was a plot to kill him, external on his return to Kenya.
NgÅ©gÄ© began self-imposed exile in the UK and then the US. He did not return to Kenya for 22 years.
When he finally did return, he received a hero's welcome - thousands of Kenyans turned out to greet him.
But the homecoming was marred when assailants broke into NgÅ©gÄ©'s apartment, brutally attacking the author and raping his wife.
NgÅ©gÄ© insisted the assault was ""political"", external.
He returned to the US, where he had held professorships at universities including Yale, New York and California Irvine.
In academia and beyond, NgÅ©gÄ© became known as one of the foremost advocates of literature written in African languages.
Throughout his career - and to this day - African literature was dominated by books written in English or French, official languages in most countries on the continent.
""What is the difference between a politician who says Africa cannot do without imperialism and the writer who says Africa cannot do without European languages?"" NgÅ©gÄ© asked in a seminal, fiery essay collection, named Decolonising the Mind. 
In one section, NgÅ©gÄ© called out Chinua Achebe - the author who helped to launch his career -  for writing in English. Their friendship soured as a result.
Away from his literary career, NgÅ©gÄ© was married - and divorced - twice. He had nine children, four of whom are published authors.
""My own family has become one of my literary rivals,"" NgÅ©gÄ© joked in a 2020 LA Times interview, external.
NgÅ©gÄ©'s son Mukoma (right) is also an author
His son, Mukoma wa NgÅ©gÄ©, has alleged that his mother was physically abused by NgÅ©gÄ© wa Thiong'o.
""Some of my earliest memories are me going to visit her at my grandmotherâs where she would seek refuge,"" his son wrote in a social media post, which NgÅ©gÄ© wa Thiong'o did not respond to.
Later in his life, NgÅ©gÄ©'s health deteriorated. He had triple heart bypass surgery in 2019 and began to struggle with kidney failure. In 1995, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and given three months to live.
NgÅ©gÄ© recovered, however, adding cancer to the lengthy list of struggles he had overcome.
But now one of African literature's guiding lights - as Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once called him - is gone, leaving the world of words a little darker.

A second suspect has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist in an upmarket Manhattan home for weeks in an effort to steal his cryptocurrency.
William Duplessie, 32, turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday after his alleged accomplice was arrested last week.
Their alleged victim told police he was hung off a roof ledge, shocked with electrical wires and attacked with a chainsaw as his attackers demanded he reveal his Bitcoin wallet password.
Both suspects are charged with kidnapping with intent to collect ransom, assault, unlawful imprisonment and other crimes.
The arrests came after the victim managed to escape a home in SoHo, one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods in New York, where he was allegedly tortured and bound for nearly three weeks. 
According to police, Mr Duplessie is the business partner of John Woeltz, 37, who was arrested on Friday. 
Mr Woeltz is a crypto investor from Kentucky and has been renting the SoHo home - where the assaults allegedly occurred - for between $30,000 (Â£22,000) and $40,000 per month, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.
Investigators in the case also arrested a woman on Friday, but prosecutors have declined to press charges against her. 
The alleged victim, who has not been named publicly, told police he came to New York from Italy on 6 May.
He alleged that upon arriving at the suspect's house, Mr Woeltz took his passport and held him captive for 17 days.
Police say he had a gun pointed at his head, was struck with the gun, and had threats made against his family as his attackers demanded he reveal his password. He was also allegedly forced to smoke crack cocaine.
The 28-year-old Italian national says he escaped on Friday morning, bloodied and barefoot, after agreeing to give the men his password.
When they went to get his laptop, the alleged victim says he fled the eight-bedroom townhouse.
He reported the attack and was taken to hospital for treatment, say authorities. 
A police search of the home found several Polaroid photos of the victim being tied up and tortured, as well as firearms and drugs, police say.
At a hearing before a judge on Tuesday, Mr Duplessie's lawyer argued that ""his involvement is hotly disputed"" and said he had shown good faith by turning himself in to authorities. 
The lawyer requested that he be allowed to post $1m bail and live with his father in Florida before his trial, but the judge denied that request and ordered him to be held in detention. 
Mr Woeltz has also been ordered to remain in jail, after prosecutors argued that he had the means to flee, including a private jet and helicopter.
In a separate case in France, police have arrested more than 20 people following a number of kidnapping plots targeting crypto entrepreneurs and their families.
Authorities said the arrests were in connection with investigations into a recent abduction attempt in Nantes and the attempted kidnapping of a woman and child in Paris in May.
David Seltzer, a criminal defence attorney who specializes in cyber-crime, said such cases are all too common.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he wants his country to join a major European plan to bolster defences by 1 July.
Speaking to CBC on Tuesday, Carney said he hoped Canada would sign on to ReArm Europe - a plan to dramatically increase defence spending on the continent to in the next five years - in a bid to reduce reliance on the US.
""Seventy-five cents of every (Canadian) dollar of capital spending for defence goes to the United States. That's not smart,"" Carney told the public broadcaster.
His remarks come amid tension with the US after threats from President Donald Trump - though Carney has also previously said he is open to joining a missile defence project proposed by Trump.
A day after Carney's remarks, Canada's defence minister told a military trade show that his country wanted to quickly boost defence capacity in the face of growing global threats.
""The global security environment is today volatile and uncertain,"" said defence minister David McGuinty on Wednesday, citing Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as a more assertive China.
McGuinty said there would be a future focus on the Arctic, where competing nations were challenging Canada's sovereignty. 
Defence also featured on Tuesday in the Speech from the Throne - an event that opened the new parliament and outlined the sitting government's agenda.
The address was read in person by King Charles III, Canada's monarch, as part of a royal visit that was designed to highlight Canada's identity and sovereignty. 
The speech contained commitments to ""rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting"" in Canada's military.
It also outlined the government's goal of strengthening defence relationships with European allies, and made mention of joining the ReArm Europe plan. 
Canada 'strong and free' and other takeaways from King's throne speech
King's Canadian speech doesn't mention you-know-who
The remarks by Canadian officials come after Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said he expected members of his Western defence alliance - including Canada - to grow their annual defence spending to a level equivalent to 5% of each nation's GDP. 
The Nato target was previously 2% of GDP, but Rutte said members must prepare to defend themselves from increasingly powerful adversaries like Russia and China.
""Russia has teamed up with China, North Korea and Iran,"" Rutte told a Nato forum in the US on Monday. ""They are expanding their militaries and their capabilities. They are preparing for long-term confrontation.""
The plan to increase Nato's spending target still has to be approved by member-country leaders, who are set to meet in the Netherlands in late June.
Canada has long faced pressure for failing to meet Nato targets, and was accused last year by US House Speaker Mike Johnson of ""riding on America's coattails"".
Canadian business leaders have also called on their government to majorly boost spending in the defence industry, touting this as a way to boost the economy. 
In Wednesday's remarks, McGuinty told defence industry representatives that Carney's government would prioritise procuring military technology and equipment from Canadian companies.
Last week, Carney said that ""high-level"" talks were also taking place with the US about joining Trump's Golden Dome missile defence system. The King's throne speech noted that Canada wanted to continue talks with the US on security on trade.
The US president posted on his Truth Social network later on Tuesday evening that the Golden Dome project would cost Canada US$61bn ""if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation."" 
""But will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State,"" he added, repeating his often-repeated view that Canada should be absorbed by the US. ""They are considering the offer!"" he claimed.
In response, Carney's office said in a statement that the prime minister ""has been clear at every opportunity, including in his conversations with President Trump, that Canada is an independent, sovereign nation, and it will remain one"".
Meanwhile, Canada's UN ambassador reposted the US president's comment on X with the response: ""In another context this would called a 'protection racket'."""

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says its military has ""eliminated"" Hamas's Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar, one of its most wanted men and the brother of the group's late leader Yahya Sinwar.
Mohammed Sinwar was reportedly the target of a massive Israeli strike on the courtyard and surrounding area of the European hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on 13 May, which the Israeli military said destroyed Hamas ""underground infrastructure"".
Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said that 28 people were killed. Hamas itself has neither confirmed nor denied Sinwar's death.
Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, was killed by Israeli troops last October.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response the unprecedented cross-border attack 600 days ago, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 54,084 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Mohammed Sinwar, 49, joined Hamas shortly after it was founded in the late 1980s and become a member of the group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.
He rose through the ranks and by 2005 he was commander of the Khan Younis Brigade.
He was believed to have been one of the masterminds of a 2006 cross-border attack in which Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was seized. Sgt Shalit was released after five years in captivity in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, including Yahya Sinwar.
Mohammed Sinwar was also reported to have been close to Hamas's late military chief Mohammed Deif and been involved in the planning of the 7 October 2023 attack.
Netanyahu announced that he was dead during a special debate in the Israeli parliament on Tuesday called by the opposition to address what it called ""the government's complete failure to achieve the war's goals: the return of all the hostages and defeating Hamas"".
In response to the criticism, the prime minister listed Israel's achievements.
""In 600 days of the 'War of Revival', we have indeed changed the face of the Middle East,"" he said. ""We drove the terrorists out of our territory, entered the Gaza Strip with force, eliminated tens of thousands of terrorists, eliminated Mohammed Deif, [political leader Ismail] Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Sinwar.""
Investigating Israel's strike on Gaza's European Hospital
Until now, Israeli officials have been cautious when speaking about Mohammed Sinwar's fate.
The Israeli military's statement about the 13 May air strike did not mention him, saying only that it targeted ""Hamas terrorists who were operating in a command-and-control centre that was embedded in an underground terrorist infrastructure site underneath the European hospital"". However, Israeli media reported at the time that he was the intended target.
Five days later, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz told parliament that, while there was no official confirmation, ""all indications"" from Israeli intelligence were that Sinwar was killed.
The European hospital has been out of service since the attack two weeks ago.
CCTV footage shows children, women and men walking around the hospital's courtyard just before it is engulfed by an explosion. As the smoke clears, a large crater begins to form.
Medics said they received no warning from Israeli authorities. The hospital was also not covered by any Israeli evacuation orders issued since the military resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March, following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.
UN human rights chief Volker TÃ¼rk said the killing of civilians was ""as tragic as it is abhorrent"", and that Israel was bound by international law to ensure to spare their lives even if it believed that destroying the underground structures offered a definite military advantage.
Netanyahu also addressed on Tuesday the issue of the 58 hostages still being held by Hamas.
""I am fully focused on the mission of bringing back all our hostages - both the living and the fallen,"" he said. ""According to the information we currently have, there are 20 hostages who are confirmed to be alive. This is undisputed. In addition, there are up to 38 other hostages who are believed to be deceased.""
Earlier this month, the prime minister said there was ""uncertainty"" about the condition of three of the 24 hostages previously believed to be alive in captivity. 
Days later, one of the living hostages, Israeli-American Edan Alexander, was freed by Hamas in what the group said was a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is attempting to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Netanyahu also declared that Israel had made ""a dramatic shift toward the complete defeat of Hamas"" over the past two days by ""taking control of food distribution in the Gaza Strip"".
He was referring to the controversial new aid distribution system run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The system uses US security contractors and bypasses the UN, which says it goes against fundamental humanitarian principles.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents many hostages' families, welcomed the prime minister's announcement about Mohammed Sinwar but told him: ""The time has come to achieve true national victory - one that includes bringing home all the hostages and beginning the restoration of Israeli society."""
41,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyz4mzww1ro,2025-05-28 11:22:46,"Dozens injured by Israeli gunfire as crowds overwhelmed Gaza aid site, UN says,","The UN Human Rights Office has said it believes 47 people were injured in Gaza on Tuesday when crowds overwhelmed an aid distribution centre run by a controversial new group backed by the US and Israel.
A senior official said the UN was still gathering information but that most of the injuries were due to gunshots and that ""it was shooting from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]"".
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said one person was killed and 48 others were wounded.
The IDF said it was checking the reports. A spokesman said troops fired ""warning shots"" into the air in the area outside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's site in the southern city of Rafah but that they did not fire towards people.
The GHF said ""no shots were fired at Palestinian crowds"" trying to obtain aid at its distribution centre, and that there were no casualties.
It also said that operations were continuing at two sites in southern Gaza despite the incident.
The GHF's aid system uses US security contractors and bypasses the UN, which says it is unworkable and unethical.
The US and Israeli governments have said it is preventing aid from being stolen by Hamas, which the armed group denies doing.
UN agencies have warned that Gaza's 2.1 million population is facing catastrophic levels of hunger after an almost three-month Israeli blockade that was eased last week.
On Tuesday, thousands of Palestinians desperate for aid headed to the GHF distribution centre in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah, which is under full Israeli military control.
In the late afternoon, videos showing chaotic scenes as thousands of men, women and children streamed into the site, walking over torn-down fences and earth berms. In one clip, some people are seen running as what appear to be gunshots ring out.
On Wednesday, the UN Human Rights Office in the Palestinian territories said it had received information that about 47 people were injured during the incident.
""It is through gunshots,"" Ajith Sunghay told reporters in Geneva. ""We are trying to confirm what has happened to them in the sense of seriousness [of the injuries]. What we know is that it was shooting from the IDF.""
A spokesman for Gaza's health ministry said one man, Salem Abu Moussa, died after being shot at the aid distribution centre. He was initially taken to the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah before being transferred to Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, where he succumbed to his wounds. Another 48 people were injured, he added.
""We are checking information from the UN. At the time we are speaking, we have no information on this matter,"" IDF spokesman Colonel Olivier Rafowicz said.
Israeli troops ""fired warning shots into the air, in the area outside"" the GHF centre, he said, adding that ""in no case [did they fire] towards the people"".
Later on Wednesday, the GHF put out a statement saying that its two distribution sites in Tal al-Sultan and the nearby Morag corridor were fully operational and had so far distributed about 14,550 food boxes to Palestinians - equivalent to 840,262 meals.
The group also said it wanted to address the claim that Palestinians were shot at and killed while trying to obtain aid at the Tal al-Sultan site on Tuesday.
""This is false. No shots were fired at Palestinian crowds at the [distribution site] and there were no casualties,"" it added.
It similarly denied that the site was overrun or destroyed. 
""According to established protocol, for a brief moment the GHF team intentionally relaxed its security protocols to safeguard against crowd reactions to finally receiving food,"" it said. 
Thousands of Gazan's stampede towards a food distribution centre
However, Mr Sunghay said: ""What we saw yesterday is a very clear example of the dangers of distributing aid in the way GHF is doing this... Exposing people to death and injury trying to get food.""
He added that many people in Gaza were fearful of traveling south to try access the aid, because of the security concerns during the long journey, and because they feared detention by Israeli forces when they got there. Many others, he said, were unable to travel: women with small children, the elderly, and those who are sick or injured.
Asked whether at least some food, as distributed by GHF, was better than no food at all, Mr Sunghay said: ""There is a right to food, but also to distribution of food and humanitarian supplies in a safe and dignified manner.""
The UN and other established aid agencies have refused to co-operate with the GHF, arguing that its operation does not comply with the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality.
They have said they have tonnes of supplies ready to enter Gaza, and a detailed plan to distribute them that minimises looting.
Gaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office said Israel's efforts to distribute aid had ""failed miserably"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech on Tuesday that his government had ""worked out a plan with our American friends to have controlled distribution sites"" for aid where it would be ""very hard for Hamas to steal it, especially because we guard these positions"".
He acknowledged that there had been ""some loss of control momentarily"" at the GHF site in Rafah, but added: ""We brought it back under control. We're going to put many more of these.""
""And the idea is basically to take away the humanitarian looting as a tool of war of Hamas to give it to the population. Eventually to have a sterile zone in the south of Gaza where the entire population can move for its own protection.""
A senior Trump administration official meanwhile said: ""Aid is getting to the people in need, and through their secure distribution system, Israel is kept safe and Hamas empty handed.""
Israel imposed a total blockade on humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Netanyahu said would see troops ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. The following day, he said Israel would also temporarily ease the blockade and allow a ""basic"" amount of food into Gaza.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 54,084 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,924 since Israel resumed its offensive, according to the territory's health ministry."

Although the village had been evacuated some days ago because of fears the Birch glacier was disintegrating, one person has been reported missing, and many homes have been completely flattened.
Blatten's mayor, Matthias Bellwald, said ""the unimaginable has happened"" but promised the village still had a future.
Local authorities have requested support from the Swiss army's disaster relief unit and members of the Swiss government are on their way to the scene.
The disaster that has befallen Blatten is the worst nightmare for communities across the Alps.
The village's 300 inhabitants had to leave their homes on 19 May after geologists monitoring the area warned that the glacier appeared unstable. Now many of them may never be able to return.
Appearing to fight back tears, Bellwald said: ""We have lost our village, but not our heart. We will support each other and console each other. After a long night, it will be morning again.""
The Swiss government has already promised funding to make sure residents can stay, if not in the village itself, at least in the locality. 
However, RaphaÃ«l Mayoraz, head of the regional office for Natural Hazards, warned that further evacuations in the areas close to Blatten might be necessary.
Climate change is causing the glaciers - frozen rivers of ice - to melt faster and faster, and the permafrost, often described as the glue that holds the high mountains together, is also thawing.
Drone footage showed a large section of the Birch glacier collapsing at about 15:30 (14:30 BST) on Wednesday. The avalanche of mud that swept over Blatten sounded like a deafening roar, as it swept down into the valley leaving an enormous cloud of dust.
Glaciologists monitoring the thaw have warned for years that some alpine towns and villages could be at risk, and Blatten is not even the first to be evacuated. 
In eastern Switzerland, residents of the village of Brienz were evacuated two years ago because the mountainside above them was crumbling. 
Since then, they have only been permitted to return for short periods.
In 2017, eight hikers were killed, and many homes destroyed, when the biggest landslide in over a century came down close to the village of Bondo. 
The most recent report into the condition of Switzerland's glaciers suggested they could all be gone within a century, if global temperatures could not be kept within a rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, agreed ten years ago by almost 200 countries under the Paris climate accord.
Many climate scientists suggest that target has already been missed, meaning the glacier thaw will continue to accelerate, increasing the risk of flooding and landslides, and threatening more communities like Blatten."

Last week, the US House of Representatives narrowly passed what Trump calls his ""big, beautiful"" bill, which includes multi-trillion dollar tax breaks and a pledge to increase defence spending. It will now head to the Senate.
Tech titan Musk told the BBC's US partner CBS News he was ""disappointed"" by the plan, which he felt ""undermines"" the work he did for the president on reducing spending.
Musk was enlisted as Trump's cost-cutting tsar - ending funds for US foreign aid among other projects - before announcing he would step back. 

""I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly,"" Musk said in the interview with CBS Sunday Morning, a clip of which was released by the broadcaster before transmission.
He went on to argue that Trump's plan ""increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it"". 
It is thought that the legislation could increase the deficit - or the difference between what the US government spends and the revenue that it receives - by about $600bn (Â£444bn) in the next fiscal year. 
Furthermore, the bill ""undermines the work that the Doge team is doing"", Musk said, using the acronym of the cost-cutting advisory body the Department of Government Efficiency. 
Referring to Trump's moniker for the legislation, Musk told CBS: ""I think a bill can be big or beautiful. I don't know if it can be both.""
US House passes Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax and spending bill
A look at the key items in the bill
Elon Musk leaves White House but says Doge will continue
Musk's intervention highlights the ongoing tension within Trump's Republican Party   over the tax-and-spend plans, which faced an uneasy passage through the House due to opposition from different wings of the party.
Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he is ""not happy about certain aspects"" of the bill while at the same time being ""thrilled"" about some aspects, such as tax cuts. 
""It's the big, beautiful bill,"" he said. ""And it's beautiful because of all the things we have."" 
When asked, Trump did not directly comment on Musk's remarks. 
Long a policy priority of Trump's, the legislation pledges to extend soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during his first administration in 2017, as well as provide an influx of money for defence spending and to fund the president's mass deportations.
The bill also proposes increasing to $4tn the debt ceiling - meaning the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow to pay its bills.
Musk's comments on the issue imply a growing distance from Trump, who he helped to propel back to the White House last year with donations of more than $250m.
They come after the billionaire recently pledged to step back from Doge. Musk had stated that he wanted to help the government cut $1tn in spending by cancelling contracts and reducing the government workforce.
As of April, Doge's website claims around $175bn has already been saved, but a BBC analysis of this figure shows it lacks some evidence. 
Musk also said last week that he planned to do ""a lot less"" political spending in the future, and that he was committed to leading electric car company Tesla for another five years.
Tesla faced protests, boycotts and a drop in sales over Musk's work as the Doge chief, including his controversial efforts to lay off thousands of federal workers and curb foreign aid.
Musk defended his actions in his comments last week, saying: ""I did what needed to be done."" He and Trump previously justified the cuts as a matter of weeding out what they saw as fraud and abuse within federal spending."

The bodies of 11 people believed to have been migrants have been found inside a boat washed onto the shores of the Caribbean island of Canouan, which forms part of St Vincent and the Grenadines.
The identities of those on board remain unclear, a police official said, but several passports found at the scene suggest they were from Mali, a land-locked country in western Africa more than 6,000km (3,800 miles) away.
The boat, measuring 45ft (14m) in length, 12ft in width and 6ft in depth, was found grounded in Little Bay, on Monday.
The discovery comes just months after a boat with 13 dead bodies -  some of whom also had Malian documents - was found washed ashore in St Kitts and Nevis.
Authorities in St Vincent and the Grenadines said they were alerted to the boat with the 11 deceased migrants on Monday.
Eujin Byun, the UN Refugee Agency's global spokesperson, told the BBC the migrants - believed to be from Mali - had probably planned to go to the Canary Islands.
Given the small size of the boat recovered in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Ms Byun said it was ""highly unlikely"" those on board would have been attempting to reach the Caribbean.
She added: ""We cannot talk on behalf of those who have passed away, but our best guess is that they wanted to take the Atlantic route to get to the Canary Islands"".
Hundreds of thousands of people have been internally displaced inside Mali, whose central and northern regions have known little stability since independence from France in September 1960, and many others have fled abroad. 
Around 6.4 million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid, according to the European Commission, and more than 1.5 million people require emergency food assistance.
Ms Byun explained that Mali had experienced ""a cycle of violence"" since 2012, when the Tuareg rebellion in northern Mali triggered a military coup and Islamist groups that helped defeat the government captured several towns. 
Access to services in the west African country had been ""severely restricted"" and Malians were crossing the border in search for better livelihoods, she added.
But when refugees cross the border to neighbouring countries in the Sahel region, they are often confronted with a similar landscape, Ms Byun said, which leads them to seek refuge further afield.
""Desperate people make desperate decisions,"" she concluded.
The UN official worries that the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe is not getting as much attention as the Mediterranean route, and ""smugglers are taking advantage of this""."

Detectives investigating the disappearance of a woman who went missing in the Republic of Ireland almost 30 years ago have begun a search at a second location.
Fiona Pender, 25, was seven months pregnant when she disappeared in Tullamore, County Offaly, in 1996.
Earlier this week, gardaÃ­ (Irish police) said they had reclassified their missing person investigation to a murder inquiry. 
Having completed a search of land near Killeigh in County Offaly on Tuesday, the search moved to the Slieve Bloom mountains close to Clonaslee in County Laois on Wednesday. Killeigh and Clonaslee are about a 10-minute drive apart across the county boundary.
The new site is a piece of open ground which will be ""subject to excavation, technical and forensic examinations,"" a garda statement said. 
Ms Pender was last seen at about 06:00 local time 23 August 1996 at her flat on Church Street, Tullamore.
She was 5'5"" in height, had long blonde hair and was said to be looking forward to the birth of her child. 
She was wearing white leggings and bright coloured clothing when she went missing. 
The previous search, on open ground about 5km (3 miles) from Tullamore, began on Monday and ended on Tuesday evening. 
Irish broadcaster RTÃ reported that the operation was concentrated on bogland at Graigue, near the village of Killeigh. 
GardaÃ­ said the results of the searches were ""not being released for operational reasons"" but added that they had kept Ms Pender's family updated. 
They repeated their appeal to ""any person who may have previously come forward who felt they could not provide gardaÃ­ with all the information they had in relation to this matter, to contact the investigation team again"". 
On Monday, police confirmed the search for Fiona Pender had been re-classified as a murder investigation
Fiona Pender grew up in Tullamore, County Offaly, in a family that has suffered a number of bereavements.
She had two brothers, but just over a year before Fiona went missing her brother Mark died in motorcycle crash.
At the time of her disappearance in August 1996, Fiona was working as a hairdresser and living with her boyfriend in a flat in Church Street in her hometown.
She had spent the previous day ""shopping for baby clothes with her mother in Tullamore,"" according to her missing person profile, external. 
""She was in good form and was looking forward to the birth of her baby,"" the garda website states.
As soon as she went missing, the Pender family began a long campaign seeking the public's help to find Fiona, led by her mother Josephine. 
In 2000, almost four years after Fiona went missing, her 50-year-old father Sean Pender was found dead in the family home. 
His widow believes he took his own life, telling a Tullamore reporter: ""He couldn't live without his children."", external
The investigation into Fiona's disappearance continued for 28 years without success, despite a number of searches and digs in different areas.
In May 2008, a hillwalker came across a makeshift cross which had been recently put up in Monicknew Woods in the Slieve Bloom mountains. 
Two planks of wood had been hammered together and written on the cross were the words: ""Fiona Pender. Buried here, August 22nd, 1996.""
GardaÃ­ began a search of a two-acre site in the area, assisted by soldiers and cadaver dogs, but there was no sign of Ms Pender's body. 
Fiona's mother Josephine died aged 68 in 2017, external, having never discovered the fate of her only daughter and her unborn grandchild. 
The Irish Times reported that a ""candle of hope"" was placed on the altar during her funeral ""in memory of all missing people"".
In tribute to her daughter, a section of walkway along the Grand Canal outside Tullamore is known as the Fiona Pender Way. 
Analysis by BBC Dublin reporter Kevin Sharkey:
Can an area around the Slieve Bloom Mountains in the Irish midlands yield a clue about what happened to Fiona Pender in the summer of 1996? 
That is a question being asked locally and around the country as gardaÃ­ begin a second search this week to try to locate the remains of the hairdresser and part-time model who was preparing for the birth of her baby when she disappeared. 
The hope at the beginning of each search since the young woman went missing almost 29 years ago has been that it might finally end her family's long and agonising wait for a breakthrough. 
To date, every search has ended in disappointment. 
The latest search, in County Laois, is just across the county border from where another search concluded in County Offaly on Tuesday. 
What is different about these two searches is that they are the first digs conducted by search teams since the investigation into the disappearance of Ms Pender was upgraded to murder at the beginning of this week. 
A two-day search of bogland near the County Offaly village of Killeigh ended on Tuesday 
To date there have been no convictions in relation to Ms Pender's disappearance nor her suspected murder. 
However, over the course of the 28-year missing person investigation, five people have previously been arrested and detained.
The investigation team have also taken more than 300 statements and ""discovered and collated thousands of documents""."

South Africans are paying tribute to actor Presley Chweneyagae, who has died at the age of 40.
His family said he had died from natural causes after experiencing breathing problems. 
Family spokesperson Mzwakhe Sigudla said that paramedics had attended to him, but he ""couldn't make it"".
Chweneyagae, who was born in 1984 in South Africa's North-West Province, got his big international break after starring in the 2005 film Tsotsi, which earned the country its first Oscar for best foreign language film.
Tsotsi, a powerful crime film in which Chweneyagae plays the lead role, explores gang life in a South Africa. 
The film is in a mix of different South African languages including Tsotsitaal, which is primarily spoken in townships.
Speaking to the BBC, South African film critic Stephen Aspeling said Tsotsi was a ""landmark film"" which came at a ""critical juncture for South Africa's film industry but also for South Africa on the international platform"".
""It's taking a look at post-apartheid South Africa, the social inequalities, conveying poverty [and] crime in townships,"" Mr Aspeling said, outlining that before Tsotsi, South Africa hadn't featured much at the Oscars.
The year after the film's release, its director, Gavin Hood, told an American student newspaper, external that Chweneyagae had ""never done a film"", before he scouted him for the movie, highlighting that Chweneyagae himself came from a ""tough neighborhood"".
Chweneyagae spoke about his acting technique in an interview on a South African podcast, external, where he said he liked to draw on his own experiences.
""You need to draw from your own emotional memory to make the scene more believable.""
He added that acting is all he had ever done work-wise, starting off with his first professional play in 1998. 
Mr Aspeling also highlighted Chweneyagae's role in iNumber Number, a film where he played a police officer, demonstrating his ""versatility"". 
In a statement announcing his death, his agency described him as a ""South African icon"" and one of the country's ""most gifted and beloved actors"".
The South African government published a post on X describing him as ""a gifted storyteller whose talent lit up our screens and hearts"".
Chweneyagae also starred in the Nelson Mandela biopic Long Walk to Freedom in 2013, as well as acting in various theatre productions. 
The South African Film and Television Awards described him as a ""true legend of South African cinema"" and a ""powerhouse performer"".
The Ministry of Sports, Art and Culture released a statement highlighting his role in the popular South African series River and Cobrizzi.
""The Department of Sports, Art and Culture, mourns the loss of a true trailblazer - a storyteller who held the soul of a nation in his craft,"" Culture Minister Gayton McKenzie said in the statement.
Speaking on the MacG podcast in 2020, Chweneyagae outlined what he hoped his legacy would be.
""I just want to be remembered as an actor who loved his work, and who had great respect for others. I think that's about it.""

A former England rugby league star has announced he will take on another seven ultra-marathons over seven days, in honour of his late teammate Rob Burrow.
Kevin Sinfield, 44,  said he and his team will begin this year's challenge - which takes place across the UK and Ireland - on 1 December, raising money and awareness for motor neurone disease (MND).
This year he hopes to raise Â£777,777 - to add to funds of more than Â£10m raised since he began running marathons in 2020, following his friend's diagnosis in 2019.
Mr Sinfield said he was excited to take on another challenge, adding it ""feels like a form of therapy at times"" - particularly last year following Rob Burrow's death, at the age of 41.
He told BBC Breakfast: ""The five challenges we've done so far have been really tough and challenging, but the people we've met so far, they've all been amazing - so it's important we keep Rob's legacy going and get the other two done.
""Hearing people's stories along the way is a massive energy-giver, as there's some dark moments on the road [when] it's dark and wet and cold, and your body is telling you to give up.
""But you take all that energy and emotion on the road and use it as fuel. We share our stories with each other every night, about what's gone on during the day, so it is really powerful.""
The team will start in Bury St Edmunds before travelling to Ipswich, Cork, Swansea, Sheffield, Workington, Whitehaven, Dundee, and North Yorkshire, arriving in Leeds on 7 December.
Kevin Sinfield has been raising money for MND since 2020
The money raised will be split between the MND Association, the Leeds Hospital Charity, Irish MND Association, the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, MND Scotland and The Darby Rimmer Foundation.
While in Cork, the team will pause to remember former Warrington Rugby League player and Munster Rugby Union coach Paul Darbyshire, who died in 2011 from MND.
""The challenge is good for me,"" Mr Sinfield said, adding: ""It's almost like a form of therapy at times, and has given us something to really go after.
""We can't just expect to rock up on the 1st December and expect it to happen, so there's 10-12 weeks before where we put a lot of time and effort in, and that involves putting yourself in a dark place - the training is the difficult bit.
""I don't like being in the dark spot but I enjoy coming through it... knowing I've been in there.""

Kenya's President William Ruto has publicly apologised to Tanzania following days of tension between the neighbouring countries.
Some Kenyans on social media have been targeting Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan following the recent detention and deportation of prominent East African activists.
Angry Tanzanian MPs on Monday accused Kenyans of cyberbullying and disrespecting Tanzanian sovereignty and ""meddling in domestic affairs"". 
Speaking at a national prayer breakfast on Wednesday, Ruto appeared to extend an olive branch to Tanzania.  
""To our neighbours from Tanzania, if we have wronged you in any way, forgive us,"" he said.
""If there is anything that Kenyans have done that is not right, we want to apologise,"" the president added.

'They aimed to kill' - BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters
Ruto also apologised to young Kenyans, popularly known as Gen-Zs, who have been critical of his administration since the deadly anti-tax protesters last June. 
Some of them have dismissed Ruto's apology, insisting that the president should resign. 
The president made the remarks in response to a call by visiting American preacher Rickey Allen Bolden, who urged leaders to pursue reconciliation.
The diplomatic row was triggered by the deportation of activists who had travelled to Tanzania to attend the trial of opposition leader Tundu Lissu.
Among them were Kenyan Boniface Mwangi and Agather Atuhaire from Uganda. 
The two said they were held incommunicado for several days and tortured, before they were left at the border by Tanzanian security forces, sparking widespread condemnation across the region and from international rights groups. 
Tanzania is yet to comment on the torture claims but President Samia had earlier warned that she would not allow activists from neighbouring countries to ""meddle"" in her country's affairs and cause ""chaos"".
Both Kenya and Uganda had formally protested against the detention of the activists, accusing the Tanzanian authorities of denying consular access despite repeated requests.
The alleged mistreatment of the activists triggered an online war, with social media users from Kenya and Tanzania clashing over the claims.
In a heated debate on Monday, Tanzanian parliamentarians expressed outrage over the young Kenyans trolling President Samia.
The MPs said Samia had every right to defend Tanzania's national interests.  
The legislators' comments angered some Kenyans who hit back by sharing lawmakers' contacts and flooding their phones with messages to express their disapproval.
Tanzania's Iringa Town MP Jesca Msambatavangu said that most of the messages came via WhatsApp, forcing her to temporarily switch off her phone.
Msambatavangu, however, welcomed the engagement, encouraging Kenyans on social media to ""counter ideas with ideas"". 
She asked young Kenyans to create a WhatsApp group for further engagement and promised to engage them in a live session on Saturday.
""Kenyans are our neighbours, our brothers, and we cannot ignore each other,"" she added.

The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has said that ""Israeli strikes in Gaza go beyond what is necessary to fight Hamas"" as the death toll there continues to mount.
Kallas also said that the EU did not support a new aid distribution model backed by the US and Israel which bypasses the UN and other humanitarian organisations.
""We don't support the privatisation of the distribution of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid can not be weaponised"", she said.
Israeli air strikes and other military actions since it resumed the war in March following a ceasefire have killed 3,924 people, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel says it is acting to destroy Hamas and get back hostages the group holds.
Recent Israel bombardments have killed large numbers of civilians. Last Friday an air strike in Khan Younis killed nine of a Palestinian doctor's 10 children. At least 35 people were killed in a school building sheltering displaced families in northern Gaza overnight into Monday.
Kallas' remarks follows an intervention by new German Chancellor Friedrich Merz who declared he ""no longer understands"" Israel's objectives in the besieged enclave. 
""The way in which the civilian population has been affected... can no longer be justified by a fight against Hamas terrorism,"" he said.
The EU is one of the largest donors of humanitarian aid to Gaza, yet Kallas said most of it was currently unable to get to Palestinians who need it. Israel imposed a complete blockade on Gaza in March and only began allowing a trickle of aid in after 11 weeks.
""The majority of the aid to Gaza is provided by the EU but it's not reaching the people as it is blocked by Israel,"" Kallas said.
""The suffering of the people is untenable.""
EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meanwhile described recent Israeli attacks on Gaza's civilian infrastructure as ""abhorrent"" and ""disproportionate"".
It also follows the strongest criticism yet by the UK, France and Canada, who demanded Israel end its military offensive in Gaza. The UK later said it was suspending trade talks with Israel.
The EU has launched a formal review of its own trade agreement with Israel and Kallas said she would present ""options"" at the upcoming EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on 23 June.
UN agencies have warned that Gaza's 2.1 million population is facing catastrophic levels of hunger after an almost three-month Israeli blockade that was eased last week.
Israel and the US are backing a new aid distribution system run by a controversial new group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
The GHF's aid distribution system uses US security contractors and bypasses the UN, which has rejected it as unethical and unworkable. The US and Israeli governments have said it is preventing aid from being stolen by Hamas, which the armed group denies doing.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated on Tuesday plans to relocate Gaza's entire population to a ""sterile zone"" in the south of the territory while Israeli troops continue fighting Hamas elsewhere. He also vowed to facilitate what he described as the ""voluntary emigration"" of much of Gaza's population to other countries - a plan many view as forcible expulsion.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas' cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 54,084 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry."

Le Scouarnec was dressed in black as he stood emotionless in court listening to judge Aude BurÃ©si deliver the verdict. In March, he admitted sexually abusing all 299 victims.
Judge BurÃ©si said the court had taken into account the fact that the former surgeon had especially sought out unwell, vulnerable and sedated victims. 
The sentence has a mandatory minimum term of two-thirds - and because Le Scouarnec has already served seven years, he may be eligible for parole by 2030.
AmÃ©lie LÃ©vÃªque, one of Le Scouarnec's victims, said: ""To think one day he could walk down the street, see people - that upsets me. We [the victims] no longer have a normal life while they're giving him back that life, and that disgusts me.""
""Twenty years is little compared to the number of victims in this trial,"" said Francesca Satta, a lawyer for some of the victims. ""It is time for the law to change so we can have more appropriate sentences.""
His lawyer Maxime Tessier said Le Scouarnec had no intention of appealing.
Le Scouarnec, 74, has been dubbed France's most prolific paedophile. He is already in jail after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces. 
The former doctor has been on trial in Brittany since late February. 
During that time dozens of his victims have testified, telling the court how the abuse they sustained as children shaped their lives.
In March, Le Scouarnec admitted sexually abusing all of his victims, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations.
He kept diaries in which he described the assaults in graphic detail, which allowed police to track down his victims â many of whom had no memory of the abuse they suffered while in Le Scouarnec's care.
Earlier this month he also said he was ""responsible"" for the deaths of two victims whose relatives say died by suicide, following the trauma of being sexually assaulted by Le Scouarnec when they were children. 
The grandparents of one of them, Mathis Vinet, who died four years ago, told the BBC about the ""descent into hell"" experienced by his grandson when police revealed to him that his name appeared in one of the diaries.
""I can no longer look at myself the same way because I am a paedophile and a child rapist,"" Le Scouarnec said during his last statements to the court last week.
""Many things have been said. I don't necessarily remember everything now. It will no doubt come back to me when I'm in my cell, but what I've witnessed [in court] is the suffering for which I am responsible,"" he said.
He added he neither wanted or expected to be given any leniency.
A long banner representing the many victims of Le Scouarnec was unfurled near the courthouse on Wednesday
The trial has sparked fury that Le Scouarnec got away with the abuse for over fifteen years, and that he was allowed to continue to treat children despite a conviction in 2005 for downloading paedophile images.
The Victims of Joel Le Scouarnec Collective group lamented that the trial had failed to capture the attention of politicians and society at large.
""No lesson has been drawn from this, neither from the medical world nor from politicians,"" the group said in a statement. Several victims held a protest in front of the courthouse ahead of the verdict being delivered on Wednesday afternoon. 
Catherine, the mother of a victim, said on the day of the verdict that it was the first time she had seen so many journalists covering the trial and added that she felt the victims had been forgotten. 
""It's a pity but my hope is that now our message can be passed on. Not for the generation that has been hurt but for my grandchildren,"" she said, adding that she hoped institutions would ""react"".
Le Scouarnec, who was present in court every day of the 14-week trial, repeatedly apologised for his ""revolting"" acts.
""I never saw tears running down his cheeks,"" said victim Manon Lemoine
Many of his victims were left unimpressed with his demeanour. ""His words are always the same, in the same tone, I don't see any sincerity in them,"" Louis-Marie, 35, told the BBC. ""The only thing I hope is that he doesn't do any more harm to society... that he stays locked up.""
""I never saw tears running down his cheeks,"" said another victim named Manon Lemoine.
But Maxime Tessier, Le Scouarnec's lawyer, said he believed his client had been sincere. ""He was very moved during this trial... It was very important for him to confess as he did. It was a moment of truth and justice.""
Mr Tessier also pointed the finger at the medical establishment, which civil parties have accused of not doing more to stop Le Scouarnec's from practicing medicine even when rumours of his paedophilia were circulating widely. 
""No one acknowledged responsibility, whereas all the victims said it's not only a man who did that - but also the system which let him do it,"" he told the BBC.
The National Order of Doctors (Cnom), which has also filed a lawsuit against Le Scouranec, said in March that it ""expressed its deep regrets"" as the former surgeon should have been ""prevented from practicing"".
""This situation has highlighted poor communication between the different entities of the Order of Doctors, and we deeply regret this,"" they said in a statement.

A court in Germany has rejected a lawsuit brought by a Peruvian farmer against German energy giant RWE in a long-awaited decision. 
SaÃºl Luciano Lliuya had argued that the firm's global emissions contributed to the melting of glaciers in Peru - threatening his hometown of Huaraz with flooding.
He was seeking â¬17,000 (Â£14,250) in compensation - money he said he would use to pay for a flood defence project to protect the city.
However, the higher regional court in the German city of Hamm on Wednesday blocked the case from proceeding further and ruled out any appeals, putting an end to Mr Lliuya's 10-year legal battle. 
RWE said it was not active in Peru and questioned why it was singled out.
It also pointed to its plans to phase out its coal-fired power plants and become carbon neutral by 2040.  
In their ruling on Wednesday, judges deemed that the flood risk to the property of Mr Lliuya was not high enough for the case to proceed.
However, in what climate change groups have hailed as a win, they did say that energy companies could be held responsible for the costs caused by their carbon emissions.
While the sum demanded by Mr Lliuya was very low, the case has become a cause celebre for climate change activists, who hope that it will set a precedent for holding powerful firms to account. 
The 44-year-old mountain guide and farmer said he had brought the case because he had seen first-hand how rising temperatures were causing glaciers near Huaraz to melt.
He said that as a result, Lake Palcacocha - which is located above the city - now has four times as much water than in 2003 and that residents like him were at risk of flooding, especially if blocks of ice were to break off from Palcacocha glacier and fall into the lake, causing it to overflow. 
He alleged that emissions caused by RWE were contributing to the increase in temperature in Peru's mountain region and demanded that the German firm pay towards building a flood defence.
Mr Lliuya also said that he chose the company because a 2013 database tracking historic emissions from major fossil fuel producers listed the German energy giant as one of the biggest polluters in Europe. 
Mr Lliuya says that as a mountain guide he has seen the effects of climate change at first hand
Mr Lliuya's original case was rejected by a lower court in Germany in 2015, with judges arguing that a single firm could not be held responsible for climate change. 
But in a surprise twist, Mr Lliuya in 2017 won his appeal with judges at the higher regional court, which accepted there was merit to his case and allowed it to proceed.
His lawyers previously argued that RWE was responsible for 0.5% of global CO2 emissions and demanded that the energy firm pay damages amounting to a proportional share of the cost of building a $3.5m-flood defence for Huaraz.
Mr Lliuya's lawyer, Roda Verheyen, celebrated the court's decision
Germanwatch, an environmental NGO which backed Mr Lliuya's case, celebrated the court's ruling saying it had ""made legal history"".
""Although the court dismissed the specific claim - finding flood risk to Luciano Lliuya's home was not sufficiently high - it confirmed for the first time that major emitters can be held liable under German civil law for risks resulting from climate change,"" it said in a statement. 
The group said it was hopeful that the decision could positively influence similar cases in other countries."

The meat of brown bears, a protected species in the EU, could soon be available to eat in Slovakia after the populist government approved plans for sale.
Last month, the cabinet authorised a plan to shoot about a quarter of the country's 1,300 brown bears in response to some recent fatal encounters.
The state-authorised slaughter has been criticised by conservationists and opposition politicians, including in the European Parliament. The brown bear is listed as a ""near threatened"" species in the EU by the World Conservation Union.
However, Slovakia's government is forging ahead with the plan and this week announced that meat from culled bears would be sold to the public to prevent waste.
From next week, organisations under the environment ministry can offer the meat for sale, provided all legal and hygiene conditions are met. 
State Minister Filip Kuffa said it was wasteful that the animals had previously been sent to carcass disposal facilities.
""We will release every shot animal that meets certain conditions for consumption. Why? Because bear meat is edible,"" he said.
Bears have become a political issue in Slovakia after a rising number of encounters with humans, including fatal attacks.
Slovakia ranks second in Europe, behind Romania which is estimated to have about 13,000 brown bears, for the number of attacks.
The country reported a total of 54 bear attacks from 2000-2020. The average number of attacks has also risen to 10 per year, rough figures suggest.
In April, a man was mauled to death while walking in a forest in Central Slovakia.
Shortly after, Prime Minister Robert Fico announced the cull, saying: ""We can't live in a country where people are afraid to go into the woods.""
He said his government would shoot up to 350 brown bears  - a figure equivalent to the species' entire population in Spain.
His government argues that a bear overpopulation problem has led to the attacks.
However environmental groups and critics say the focus should be on prevention. 
Michal Wiezik, an ecologist and MEP for the opposition party Progressive Slovakia, told the BBC last month the government's plan was ""absurd"" and it had already failed to limit the number of attacks ""by the unprecedented culling of this protected species.""
Wiezik argued that thousands of encounters a year passed without incident and he hoped the European Commission would intervene.
Miroslava Abelova of Greenpeace Slovakia called the culling plan ""completely reckless,"" accusing the government of ignoring conservation laws and scientific advice. 
Brown bears are strictly protected under EU directives, and may only be killed in exceptional cases - such as threats to public safety - when no other alternatives exist.
Bear meat is not commonly eaten in Europe and is considered a delicacy only in a few regions, such as parts of Eastern Europe and the Nordic countries. 
In most EU member states, strict hunting rules and the protected status of the bears mean the meat is rarely available. When it is, it is usually from controlled culls or licensed hunting and not commonly found in restaurants or shops.
Where bear meat is consumed, health officials warn of the risk of Trichinella - a parasite that can cause serious illness in humans. 
The European Union Food Safety regulation requires all bear meat to be tested for Trichinella larvae before it can be sold and the US' Centre for Disease Control Prevention stipulates an internally cooked temperature of at least 70 degrees centigrade to kill the parasite. Freezing, smoking or drying the meat does not make it safe."

US President Donald Trump's administration has ordered US embassies around the world to stop scheduling appointments for student visas as it prepares to expand social media vetting of such applicants.
An official memo said social media vetting would be stepped up for student and foreign exchange visas, which would have ""significant implications"" for embassies and consulates.
It comes during a wide-ranging Trump crackdown on some of America's most elite universities. He sees these institutions as too left-wing - accusing them of failing to combat antisemitism when pro-Palestinian protests have unfolded on campuses.
Responding to the move, China called on the US to protect international students.
""We urge the US side to earnestly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of international students, including those from China,"" an official was quoted as saying. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students attend US universities.
The universities themselves are likely to be disquieted as well. Many of them rely on foreign students for a significant chunk of their funding - as those scholars often pay higher tuition fees.
Foreign students who want to study in the US are usually required to schedule interviews at a US embassy in their home country before approval.
State department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday: ""We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.""
Are you a student who has been affected by the issues in this story? Tell us here
The memo, viewed by the BBC's US partner CBS News, directed US embassies to remove any unfilled appointments from their calendars for students seeking visas, but said those with appointments already scheduled could go ahead.
The pause would last ""until further guidance is issued"", Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote.
The memo also said the state department was preparing for an ""expansion of required social media screening and vetting"" applicable to all student visa applications. 
Trump administration to 'aggressively' revoke visas of Chinese students
It did not spell out what the vetting would look for. 
The Trump administration had already enhanced its vetting of student social media, according to a report by the Guardian in March, which linked the move to a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campuses.
In April, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that it would consider ""antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests"".
As part of the broader crackdown, Trump's team has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for universities and moved to deport students, while revoking thousands of visas for others. Many of these actions have been blocked by the courts.
The White House has accused some US universities of allowing pro-Palestinian activism on campus to be hijacked by antisemitism.
Universities have accused the Trump administration of trying to infringe on free speech. Critics say the new policy on social media vetting represents a further violation of the rights that are supposed to be enshrined by the First Amendment in the US Constitution.
Trump has throughout his presidency countered that he is working to defend free speech.
Harvard University has been the focal point of the president's ire; he has frozen $2.65bn (Â£1.96bn) in federal grants to the institution and has sought to put other federal funding worth $100m under review. 
The university's president has said the cuts will ""hurt"" the country, not just Harvard, because academics were conducting research deemed ""high-priority"" by the government.
Last week, Trump also revoked Harvard's ability to enrol international students or host foreign researchers. A federal judge blocked the policy.
If the measure is ultimately allowed, it could deliver a devastating blow to the university, where more than a quarter of students are from overseas. Students protested against the move at the university's campus near Boston on Tuesday."

A former college principal in the eastern Indian state of Odisha has been sentenced to life in prison for sending a parcel bomb that killed a newlywed man and his great aunt in 2018. 
A court found Punjilal Meher, 56, guilty of murder, attempted murder, and use of explosives in what became known as the ""wedding bomb"" case that stunned India. 
The bomb, disguised as a wedding gift, was delivered to the home of Soumya Sekhar Sahu, a 26-year-old software engineer, just days after his wedding. 
When the couple opened the package, it exploded - killing Sahu and his great aunt, and leaving his wife, Reema, who opened the package, critically wounded.
Punjilal Meher was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, and use of explosives
While acknowledging the prosecution's argument that it was a ""heinous"" crime, the court declined to classify it as a ""rarest of the rare"" case deserving the death penalty.
The BBC covered the incident in a detailed two-part investigative series.
Who sent the wedding gift bomb that killed this newlywed?
A wedding bomb, a letter and an unlikely suspect
The February 2018 explosion took place in Patnagarh, a quiet town in Odisha's Bolangir district. 
The victims had been married just five days and were preparing lunch when a parcel arrived at their home. It was addressed to Soumya and appeared to be a wedding gift, allegedly sent from Raipur in Chattisgarh state, over 230km (142 miles) away.
As Soumya pulled a thread on the parcel to open it, a powerful blast tore through the kitchen, killing him and his 85-year-old great-aunt Jemamani Sahu. Reema, then 22, survived with serious burns, a punctured eardrum, and trauma.
After a prolonged investigation, police arrested Meher, then 49, a teacher and former principal of a local college where Soumya's mother worked. 
Investigators had told me then that Meher harboured a grudge over professional rivalry and meticulously planned the attack. He used a false name and address to mail the bomb from Raipur, choosing a courier service without CCTV or parcel scanning.
The bomb travelled over 650km by bus, passing through multiple hands before being delivered. Investigators said it was a crude but deadly device wrapped in jute thread, rigged to detonate on opening.
The parcel carrying the explosive bore a fake name - SK Sharma from Raipur. Weeks passed with no clear suspects. Investigators scoured thousands of phone records and interrogated over 100 people, including one man who had made a threatening call after Reema's engagement - but nothing stuck.
Then, in April, an anonymous letter reached the local police chief. 
It claimed the bomb had been sent under the name ""SK Sinha,"" not Sharma, and cryptically mentioned motives of ""betrayal"" and money.
The letter claimed three men had ""undertaken the project"" and were now ""beyond police reach"". It cited the groom's ""betrayal"" and money - hinting at a scorned lover or property dispute - as motives. It also asked police to stop harassing innocents. 
The letter turned the investigation.
Arun Bothra, a police officer who then headed Odisha's crime branch, noticed that the handwriting on the parcel's receipt had been misread: it did resemble ""Sinha"" more than ""Sharma."" 
Crucially, the letter writer seemed to know this - something only the sender could have known. 
The police now believed the suspect had sent the letter himself.  
""It was clear that the sender knew more about the crime than we did. By writing that it was being sent by a messenger, he wanted to tell us that the crime was not the work of a local man. He wanted to tell us that the plot was executed by three people. He wanted to be taken seriously, so he was kind of blowing his fake cover by pointing out a mistake we had made,"" Mr Bothra told me in 2018.

A video grab of the kitchen moments after the incident in 2018
The victim's mother, a college teacher, recognised the letter's writing style and phraseology as that of a colleague, Meher, a former principal she had replaced. 
Police had previously dismissed Meher's workplace rivalry as routine academic politics. Now he became the prime suspect.
Under questioning, Meher initially offered an implausible story about being forced to deliver the letter under threat. 
Police allege he later confessed: he had hoarded firecrackers during Diwali, extracted gunpowder, built the bomb, and mailed it from Raipur using a courier.
He allegedly left his phone at home to create an alibi and avoided CCTV by not buying a train ticket. Meher had even attended both the victim's wedding and funeral.

Australia's main opposition political party - a coalition of the Liberals and Nationals - has been revived after the two party leaders agreed to reunite.
The latest development comes a week after the break-up of the long-standing coalition of the two conservative parties.
Liberal leader Sussan Ley thanked the Nationals leader David Littleproud for the ""respectful and productive way"" the two parties had negotiated their reunification - the pair also announced its new shadow cabinet made up of members from both parties.
The Coalition split last Tuesday after Littleproud said both parties were not able to agree on key policy matters but it appears those issues have now been resolved.
""The focus now is on [Australia's Prime Minister] Anthony Albanese and the Labor government and holding them to account 'cause that's important for our democracy,"" he told media on Wednesday afternoon.
Ley added that the Coalition will be ""stronger together, better together and we can't wait to do this on behalf of the Australian people"".
In announcing the split last week, Littleproud said the Coalition had broken up and reunited in the past, adding that he would work with Ley to ""rebuild the relationship to the point we can re-enter a coalition before the next election"".
Ley replaced former Liberal leader Peter Dutton following the Coalition's poor election results earlier this month, with Labor winning its second term in a landslide victory. She has vowed to bring the Liberals back to the centre-right.
The relationship between the Liberals and Nationals - which mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals - had become strained in recent times, with climate and energy being key points of contention.
According to local broadcaster ABC, the two parties have agreed to ditch an earlier commitment to build seven nuclear power plants but will push to lift the national ban on nuclear power.
Other policy positions which have been negotiated as part of the Coalition coming back together include regional infrastructure spending, internet speeds and mobile coverage in regional and rural areas, and improving supermarket competition, the ABC reported.
At Wednesday's press conference, both leaders refused to be drawn on the issue of net zero commitments â a sticking point within the Coalition - with Ley saying those discussions will happen"" inside the policy development process"".
The Coalition reuniting was a ""major win"" for Ley, according to Mark Kenny, director of the Australian Studies Institute, who told the BBC that the initial break-up was a ""dramatic negotiating manoeuvre aimed at gaining greater representation for [Littleproud's] party"".
Many political observers had expected the Coalition would reunite, Pandanus Petter from the Australian National University's School of Politics and International Relations told the BBC. 
""Neither party can hope to govern without the other,"" Mr Petter said, ""so maybe [the Nationals] feel they've made their point and were able to get some concessions from the Liberals in renegotiation"".
The Liberal-National partnership, which in its current form dates back to the 1940s, has broken down and been re-established several times over the decades. 
The last time the Coalition split was almost four decades ago, in 1987."

A spate of arrests, diplomatic expulsions and public humiliations has plunged relations between war-torn Ukraine and its prickly Nato neighbour Hungary to a new low.
At the heart of the row are accusations that Viktor Orban's Fidesz government in Hungary is using the spat to fight his main political rival, the opposition Tisza party, which leads in the polls ahead of 2026 elections.
Earlier this month, Ukraine's SBU security service announced the arrest of two Ukrainian citizens accused of spying for Hungary.
According to the allegations, backed by video and audio evidence, the man and woman were in the pay of Hungarian military intelligence, preparing for Hungarian military action in Ukraine. 
Hungary then expelled two Ukrainian diplomats and Ukraine followed suit in a tit-for-tat response that has further damaged already sour relations. Hungary also arrested a Ukrainian citizen and accused him of spying.
Orban is widely seen as Russia's closest ally in the European Union, and his government has broken ranks with his European partners by maintaining trade and opposing sanctions on Russia, refusing to allow the transit of weapons, and comparing Ukraine to Afghanistan.
Now he has accused Kyiv of trying to ""vilify"" his country.
All eight million Hungarian households recently received a questionnaire from the government, dubbed ""Vox 2025"", inviting them to reject Ukraine's EU membership.
Under a year ago, Orban presented himself as the only person on the planet other than the Pope, who was trying to secure an unconditional ceasefire.
But his critics depicted his so-called peace mission to Kyiv, Moscow and other capitals as an attempt to reward Russian aggression.
The day after Orban met Russia's Vladimir Putin, Russian missiles struck the Ohmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv. 
Three days later, the leader of the Tisza Party in Hungary, Peter Magyar, brought $40,000 (Â£29,000) of Hungarian medical aid to the hospital. Opinion polls suggest Magyar could oust Orban from power next April.
The man who drove the Tisza leader to Kyiv, Roland Tseber, is now a target of Fidesz attempts to accuse the Hungarian opposition party of betraying Hungary.
Roland Tseber (R) drove Peter Magyar (L) to Kyiv in July 2024 after a Russian attack on the capital
Roland Tseber came across as a fresh-faced, hard-working politician when I met him at a Ukrainian refugee centre in Uzhorod in April. 
He was helping distribute medical aid from Hungary, working with Hungarian doctors and psychologists who have supported internally displaced Ukrainians from the eastern war zone, since 2022. 
His troubles began within weeks of Peter Magyar's visit, he told me. 
In August, he heard he was banned from Hungary and, at Hungary's insistence, from the whole Schengen zone of the EU, without explanation. 
Mr Tseber's letter to the Hungarian embassy in Kyiv went unanswered. 
The leader of the far-right Our Homeland party in the Hungarian Parliament, Laszlo Toroczkai, labelled him a ""terrorist"". Mate Kocsis the leader of the Fidesz faction in the Hungarian parliament, has called him a ""Ukrainian spy"", long in the sights of Hungarian counter-intelligence.
""I reject all such accusations which try to link me to intelligence activities of any kind. This is ridiculous. I'm a Transcarpathian politician who works honestly and openly for his homeland and for Hungarian interests,"" Mr Tseber told me in a phone interview.
Both Hungary's government and its citizens regularly send medical help to Ukraine
As an elected, independent councillor in the regional assembly of Transcarpathia, who sits in the political group of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's Servant of the People party, he meets politicians of all shades, he says, including the deputy Hungarian Foreign Minister, Levente Magyar.
""I'm a Ukrainian politician and I meet with everyone. This whole situation is ridiculous. They want to drag me into this spy story. But anyone with any common sense can understand that this is absurd.""
The weakest link in the Hungarian government's narrative is that if he was really on the radar of Hungarian intelligence, government politicians and Peter Magyar as a Member of the European Parliament would have been warned to stay away from him.
The dwindling Hungarian community in Transcarpathia has become collateral damage in the Ukraine-Hungary row. 
In Ukraine's last census, in 2001, their population was 150,000, but latest estimates suggest their number has since halved to 70-80,000. Dozens have lost their lives, fighting for Ukraine against Russia.
Another twist in the story is that a former Hungarian chief-of-staff, Romulusz Ruszin-Szendi, who's now a prominent Tisza party politician, has come under attack from government-controlled media. 
The government alleges that ""a former senior figure in the defence sector"" - an apparent reference to Ruszin-Szendi - was in contact with Ukrainian intelligence. 
Ruszin-Szendi hit back, alleging a smear campaign. ""I am a decent Hungarian citizen who has worn the uniform since the age of 14. I am shocked and saddened to know that what I and my comrades have done for our country is worth so much for you,"" he addressed the government on Facebook.
Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Viktor Orban has portrayed himself as a man of peace, and won the April 2022 election with a promise to keep Hungary out of the war in Ukraine.
However, a speech from 2023 that has only just been leaked by Peter Magyar tells a very different story.
Defence Minister Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky was recorded saying a year after the war in Ukraine began that the government had decided to break with the peace mentality and move to ""phase zero of the road to war"", with a combat-ready Hungarian army.
This was the same year that many experienced Atlanticists such as Ruszin-Szendi were sacked as part of a ""rejuvenation"" of the military.
They were replaced by officers loyal to the government's pro-Moscow stance."

Capricorn Clark, who worked on-and-off for Mr Combs for more than a decade, told his trial that the defendant and a security guard had shown up to her apartment in 2011 and forced her to drive with them to Kid Cudi's home.
""Get dressed,"" she recalled Mr Combs saying. ""We're going to go kill this [expletive]."" She also told the court Diddy had threatened to kill her on her very first day working for him.
Mr Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.
The Kid Cudi incident was first discussed in the trial last week when that rapper, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi, took the stand to testify against Mr Combs. 
He detailed his relationship with Mr Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, an alleged break-in at his Los Angeles home and an incident in which his Porsche was damaged by a Molotov cocktail, which he believed Mr Combs orchestrated.
Mr Combs is facing possible life in prison if convicted on federal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.

Diddy a 'mastermind'? How Cassie's testimony builds the case against him
What is Sean 'Diddy' Combs charged with and how long will his trial last?
The rapper has separately denied accusations in a barrage of civil lawsuits that echo some of the claims made in his criminal case.
In her testimony on Tuesday, Ms Clark - who was global brand director for Mr Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment - said the hip-hop mogul had arrived at her home in 2011 after he discovered Ms Ventura was in a relationship with Mr Mescudi.
Mr Combs was holding a gun in his hand when he arrived, she said, and appeared ""livid"" and told her ""we're going to kill"" Mr Mescudi.
She told the court he forced her to get into a car and go with them against her will, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. 
Capricorn Clark worked for Sean ""Diddy"" Combs for more than a decade
Under cross-examination by Mr Combs' lawyer, Ms Clark denied that she went with him voluntarily.
Once they arrived at Mr Mescudi's home, Mr Combs and a security guard went inside while she called Ms Ventura from the car and told her what was unfolding. 
When Mr Combs returned and caught her on the phone he became more angry, Ms Clark said, adding that they sped off as Mr Mescudi arrived back at his home. 
Afterwards, the court heard that the defendant had told Ms Clark he would not let her go until she and Ms Ventura persuaded Mr Mescudi that Mr Combs was not involved in the break-in at his LA home.
""If you don't convince him of that I'll kill all you,"" Mr Combs told Ms Clark, she testified.
Ms Clark also described the difficult working relationship she had with Mr Combs over the years.
On her very first day in the job, she testified, Mr Combs threatened to kill her as he warned that her past work for other rappers had better not become a problem for him.
But, she told the court, despite the tumult she also felt like his protector and wanted to remain in his circle. 
""He broke the ceiling of what we were allowed to do as black people in the business world.""

The Trump administration will direct US federal agencies to review Harvard University's grants to potentially end or redistribute funding, as part of the White House's escalating battle with America's oldest university.
The Government Services Administration (GSA) plans to circulate a letter to agencies asking them to identify whether Harvard contracts could be ""cancelled or redirected elsewhere"", a senior White House official said.
The administration estimates about 30 contracts, collectively worth $100m (Â£74m), could be reviewed. It already had frozen $2.65bn in federal grants and tried to revoke Harvard's ability to enrol international students.
Harvard University did not immediately comment.
On its website, the university says that its ""cutting-edge medical, scientific, and technological research"" has historically been ""supported by the federal government"" and other entities.
Touting the institution's research on cancer, heart disease, infectious diseases and obesity, the university website warns that ""without federal funding, this work will come to a halt midstream"".
US halts student visa appointments
The White House will not revoke the funds automatically, but rather kick off a review of money Harvard receives from the federal government to determine whether that funding is critical in the eyes of the administration.
GSA will recommend each agency ""terminate for convenience each contract that it determines has failed to meet its standards"", and consider reallocating those funds elsewhere.
A draft of the letter accuses Harvard of engaging in discrimination and antisemitism as justification for the move.
Students and faculty at the university have criticised the Trump administration for its penalties against Harvard. On Tuesday evening, a few dozen gathered in protest.
""The administration's excuse that these policies somehow address antisemitism are so absurd,"" said Jacob Miller, a student and former head of Harvard Hillel, the Jewish social hub on campus.
An administration official told the BBC that potential cuts would not affect hospitals affiliated with Harvard University. 
And if a federal grant was deemed critical to a particular agency's functions, they said, that agency could make a case to preserve funding.
The White House and Harvard have been locked in a political, legal and financial battle - the stakes of which have dramatically escalated over the past two months.
This is not the first time the administration has attempted to block Harvard's funding. In April, the White House threatened the university's tax exempt status and froze $2.2bn in federal funding, prompting a lawsuit. A month later, it cut another $450 million in grants.
Last week, the Trump administration also tried to revoke Harvard's ability to enrol international students or host foreign researchers, prompting mass confusion among thousands of impacted students and another lawsuit from Harvard. A judge later issued a temporary restraining order blocking the move.
Before news broke of the latest attempt at cuts, Harvard University president Alan Garber told NPR on Tuesday morning: ""Why cut off research funding? 
""Sure, it hurts Harvard, but it hurts the country because after all, the research funding is not a gift.
""The research funding is given to universities and other research institutions to carry out work â research work â that the federal government designates as high-priority work. 
""It is work that they want done. They are paying to have that work conducted.""
One department hit by funding cuts is the Sinclair Lab at Harvard Medical School, which studies aging and seeks to find interventions for Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, cancer, infertility, immune disorders, and more.
""We aim to understand and reverse the underlying mechanisms of aging to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases and tissue injuries,"" the lab's founder, anti-aging geneticist David Sinclair, told the BBC via email. 
Under the Trump administration, the laboratory lost a National Institutes of Health grant, and researcher Kelly Rich lost a career grant to study age reversal to combat motor diseases. The White House's move to revoke Harvard's ability to host international researchers had affected six people - half of the laboratory's staff.
""The loss of funding not only halts ongoing experiments that cannot simply be restarted, but also jeopardizes the contributions of international scholars who are integral to the lab's operations and the wealth of the US,"" Mr Sinclair said.
Adam Nguyen, a Harvard alumnus and founder of the admissions consulting firm Ivy Link, said that the potentially ""hugely negative"" impact would fall on graduate and PhD students. Academics from both the US and abroad rely on outside funding for their research, he said.
""If you have the cuts, they're out of a job,"" Mr Nguyen said. ""It's as simple as that. There's no money to fund their research. You're talking about cuts, lay-offs and immediate stop-work orders for many graduate students."""

A judge in Argentina has stood down from the trial of Diego Maradona's medical staff after being criticised for taking part in a documentary about the case. 
Seven members of the legendary footballer's medical team have been charged with negligent homicide relating to his death in 2020. They deny the allegations.
Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari accused Judge Julieta Makintach of behaving ""like an actress and not a judge"".
She was one of three judges in the case which has been adjourned. A decision about whether a new trial will be ordered will be made on Thursday.  
Maradona had been recovering at his home in Buenos Aires from surgery on a brain blood clot in November 2020 when he died of a heart attack, aged 60.
Prosecutors allege his death could have been avoided and describe the care given as ""reckless, deficient and unprecedented"".
The medical team on trial includes a neurosurgeon, a doctor and a night nurse.  They claim the football star refused further treatment and should have stayed at home for longer after his operation.
If convicted, they face between eight and 25 years in prison.  
The long-awaited trial began on 11 March and was expected to last until July however its future has been thrown into doubt. 
Judge Makintach said she had ""no choice"" but to excuse herself from the case.  
Judge Julieta Makintach had denied authorising filming inside the Buenos Aires court but her credibility was questioned after footage from a trailer emerged
It is a violation of court rules for unauthorised filming to take place. 
As a trailer for the documentary series Divine Justice was played in court, defence lawyer Rodolfo Baque shouted ""trash!"" at Judge Makintach.  
Maradona's daughter Gianinna and his former partner Veronica Ojeda both cried after seeing the footage.  
Ms Ojeda's lawyer Mario Baudry said there was a feeling that the case had now been ""compromised"" and it was ""healthiest to start over from scratch"".
The court will decide whether the trial can continue with a new judge or whether it will have to start again from the beginning. 
In July, an eighth member of Maradona's medical team will face a separate trial by jury."

Nitrous oxide â known colloquially as ""laughing gas"" â has many uses, from a painkiller during dental procedures to a whipping agent for canned whipped cream.
While its euphoric side effects have long been known, the rise of vaping has helped create a perfect delivery vehicle for the gas - and a perfect recipe for an addiction, experts warn.
Meg Caldwell's death wasn't inevitable.
The horse rider from Florida had started using nitrous oxide recreationally in university eight years ago. But like many young people, she started to use more heavily during the pandemic.
The youngest of four sisters, she was ""the light of our lives,"" her sister Kathleen Dial told the BBC.
But Ms Caldwell's use continued to escalate, to the point that her addiction ""started ruining her life"".
She temporarily lost use of her legs after an overdose, which also rendered her incontinent. Still, she continued to use, buying it in local smoke shops, inhaling it in the car park and then heading straight back into the shop to buy more. She sometimes spent hundreds of dollars a day.
She died last November, in one of those car parks just outside a vape shop.
""She didn't think that it would hurt her because she was buying it in the smoke shop, so she thought she was using this substance legally,"" Ms Dial said.
The progression of Ms Caldwell's addiction â from youthful misuse to life-threatening compulsion â has become increasingly common. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers found there was a 58â¯% increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide in the US between 2023-2024.
What is nitrous oxide and how dangerous is it?
'Daily use of laughing gas left me in a wheelchair'
In a worst-case scenario, inhalation of nitrous oxide can lead to hypoxia, where the brain does not get enough oxygen. This can result in death. Regular inhalation can also lead to a Vitamin B12 deficiency which can cause nerve damage, degradation of the spinal column and even paralysis. The number of deaths attributed to nitrous oxide poisonings rose by more than 110% between 2019 and 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Possession of nitrous oxide was criminalised in the UK in 2023 after misuse among young people increased during the pandemic. But while many states have also outlawed the recreational use of the product in the US, it is still legal to sell as a culinary product. Only Louisiana has totally banned the retail sale of the gas.
Galaxy Gas, a major manufacturer, even offers recipes for dishes, including Chicken Satay with Peanut Chili Foam and Watermelon Gazpacho on their website. With flavours like Blue Raspberry or Strawberries and Cream, experts warn this loophole - as well as major changes in packaging and retail - has contributed to the rise in misuse.
Until recently users would take single-use plain metal canisters weighing around 8g and inhale the gas using a balloon. But when usage spiked during the pandemic, nitrous oxide manufacturers began selling much larger canisters online â as large as 2kg â and, eventually, in shops selling electronic vapes and other smoking paraphernalia.
Companies also began to package the gas in bright colourful canisters with designs featuring characters from computer games and television series.
Pat Aussem, of the Partnership to End Addiction, believes these developments are behind increased misuse:
""Even being called Galaxy Gas or Miami Magic is marketing,"" she said. ""If you have large canisters, then it means that more people can try it and use it and that can lead to a lot of peer pressure.""
The BBC reached out for comment to both Galaxy Gas and Miami Magic but did not receive a response. Amazon, where the gas is sold online, has said they are aware of customers misusing nitrous oxide and that they are working to implement further safety measures. In a response to reporting from CBS News, the BBC's news partner in the US, Galaxy Gas maintained that the gas was intended for culinary use and that they include a message on their sites warning against misuse.
Concern about nitrous oxide misuse increased last year, after several videos of people using the product went viral online.
On social media, videos of young people getting high on gas became a trend. A video uploaded in July 2024 by an Atlanta-based fast-food restaurant featured a young man inhaling Strawberries and Cream flavoured nitrous oxide saying ""My name's Lil T, man"", his voice made deeper by the gas. To date the clip has been viewed about 40 million times and spawned thousands of copies.
Misuse also featured heavily in rap music videos and Twitch streaming. Guests tried it on the Joe Rogan Show and rappers including Ye (formerly Kanye West) spoke about abusing the substance publicly. Ye has since sued his dentist for ""recklessly"" supplying Ye with ""dangerous amounts of nitrous oxide"".
In response to the trend, TikTok blocked searches for ""galaxy gas,"" and redirected users to a message offering resources about substance use and addiction. Rapper SZA also alerted her social media followers about its harms and slammed it for ""being MASS marketed to black children"".
In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an official alert warning against inhaling the gas after it ""observed an increase in reports of adverse events after inhalation of nitrous oxide products"". 
The FDA told the BBC that it ""continues to actively track adverse events related to nitrous oxide misuse and will take appropriate actions to protect the public health"".
Flavoured nitrous oxide cans sold in a smoke shop near Washington, DC
But for some, these warnings came too late.
In 2023, the family of a 25-year-old woman, Marissa Politte successfully sued Nitrous Distributor United Brands for $745m in damages after the radiology technician was killed by a driver high on nitrous oxide. The jury found the company responsible for selling the product in the knowledge that it would be misused.
""Marissa Politte's death shouldn't have happened in the first place, but my God, it should be the last,"" Johnny Simon, the Politte family's lawyer, said at the time. In the years since there have been several fatal traffic accidents involving the gas both in the US and the UK.
Meanwhile, Ms Caldwell's family have launched a class action lawsuit against manufacturers and distributors of nitrous oxide, hoping to remove the product from retail sales across the US for good.
""The people who administer nitrous oxide in a dentist office now have to go through hours and hours of training, she said. ""It just is crazy to me that the drug can be purchased in a smoke shop to anyone who goes in.""
""Unfortunately, it's become very obvious that the manufacturers and the owners of the smoke shops are not going to do the moral thing and take this off the shelves themselves,"" Ms Dial said."

US President Donald Trump says he'll be issuing a pardon for a couple who starred in a reality TV show before being jailed in a multi-million dollar fraud and tax evasion case.
Todd and Julie Chrisley were cast in the reality TV series Chrisley Knows Best, which followed the duo in their career as property tycoons in Nashville and Atlanta.
But in June 2022 a jury found them guilty of tax evasion and defrauding banks out of more than $36m (Â£26.6m) in loans.
Earlier this month the couple's daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was interviewed by the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, on Fox News.
Todd and Julie Chrisley were first indicted in 2019, then faced a three-week trial on fraud, tax evasion and obstruction of justice charges three years later.
Prosecutors said that they submitted fake documents to community banks, spending the money on luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate, and travel before using new fraudulent loans to pay off the old ones.
After spending the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy. The couple then used a company to hide income from their TV show and avoid paying a $500,000 tax bill, prosecutors said in 2022.
The couple blamed a former employee, but were convicted after a three-week trial.
Todd Chrisley was sentenced to 12 years in prison and Julie Chrisley was sentenced to seven years. Their accountant, Peter Tarantino, was also convicted and received a three-year sentence.

Savannah Chrisley spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee
In a video posted online by White House aide Margo Martin, Trump was shown speaking on the phone with the Chrisley children.
""Your parents are going to be free and clean and I hope we can do that by tomorrow,"" the president said. ""I don't know them but give them my regards, and wish them a good life.""
Savannah Chrisley is a podcaster and social media influencer who also appeared on several other reality shows and campaigned for Trump, including a speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where she alleged that her parents had been persecuted by ""rogue prosecutors"" and that the US has a ""two-faced justice system"".
On Lara Trump's Fox News programme, My View, broadcast on 18 May, she was billed as a prison reform advocate and claimed that her parents had been prosecuted for their political beliefs and called their case ""eerily similar"" to the criminal charges that were lodged against President Trump.
""Both prosecutors were Democrats, they have donated to Democratic candidates,"" Ms Chrisley told Lara Trump. ""At trial, we knew it was game over.""
Chrisley Knows Best was broadcast on the station USA Network starting in 2014 and inspired a number of spinoffs including According to Chrisley and Growing Up Chrisley.
It's the second pardon Trump has flagged in the space of two days. On Monday, he granted a pardon to a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted on fraud and bribery charges.
A jury found former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins guilty of accepting more than $75,000 (Â£55,000) in bribes last December, in exchange for making several businessmen into law enforcement officers without them being trained.
Jenkins, a long-time supporter of Trump, was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison.

The address in Ottawa set out the government's priorities on behalf of new Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose Liberals won the country's general election in April. The campaign was dominated by US President Donald Trump's threats to Canada's independence.
The King, who is Canada's head of state, said relationships with partners - including the US - were changing, and he stressed the sovereignty of both nations.
Here are five takeaways from Tuesday's address, which was the first time a monarch has delivered the throne speech opening parliament in almost 50 years. 
Carney's invitation to King Charles was in part a message to Trump, who has made repeated remarks undermining its sovereignty. 
Tensions with Canada's neighbour were a theme throughout, though the US president was never mentioned by name. 
The speech opened with an appeal to patriotism as a trade war looms with the US, Canada's largest economic partner. The King spoke of the ""pleasure and pride"" of being in the country at a time of renewed ""national pride, unity, and hope"". 
He expressed his ""admiration for Canada's unique identity"" and its growth since the last time a sovereign opened parliament - Queen Elizabeth II in 1957. (She gave a second throne speech 20 years later). It has become ""a bold, ambitious, innovative country,"" he said. 
""The Crown has for so long been a symbol of unity for Canada,"" the King added. ""It also represents stability and continuity from the past to the present. As it should, it stands proudly as a symbol of Canada today, in all her richness and dynamism."" 
The speech concluded on a similar note: ""As the anthem reminds us: The True North is indeed strong and free!""
Analysis: King's speech doesn't mention you-know-who
The King's decision to open parliament - a role traditionally left to the governor general, his top representative in Canada - has been seen as a symbolic show of support for the Commonwealth nation.
Later in the day, Trump again suggested that Canada should be annexed by the US - an idea that Ottawa has flatly rejected - as he touted his plan for a North American missile defence shield.
The US president posted on his Truth Social network that his so-called Golden Dome project would cost Canada $61bn ""if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation, but will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State"". 
""They are considering the offer!"" he claimed.
Another major theme of the speech was how Canada would face a world with ""unprecedented challenges, generating uncertainties across the continents"". 
Another nod to the US and tensions between the two countries followed: ""The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada's relationships with partners are also changing,"" the King said. 
The speech underscored the need for the country to reinforce its established trading relationships, notably with European allies, while moving forward with economic and security relationship talks with the US. 
During the recent election campaign, Carney repeatedly said the country was at a pivotal moment in its history. The King's speech emphasised that ""this moment is also an incredible opportunity"".
""An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War."" 
The King also focused directly on domestic policy and plans set out by Carney's Liberals to address the country's economic headwinds. 
There was a commitment to speed up major national infrastructure projects and to double a loan programme that would enable more indigenous ownership of major projects. 
The government also said it would introduce legislation by 1 July to remove federal barriers to internal trade within the country.  According to the government, interprovincial trade and labour mobility barriers cost the country as much as C$200bn ($145bn; Â£107bn) each year. 
Opposition parties reacted to the Liberal government's domestic agenda laid out in the speech, with Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre saying it lacked ""specific plans"" on implementing some of the big commitments, like energy projects. 
Canada faces housing affordability crises as housing prices have skyrocketed across the country in the last decade. 
Alongside the US-Canada relationship, it was one of the top issues on the campaign trail. Carney's Liberals promised to double the rate of building to 500,000 new homes a year.
The King's speech underlined the government's other plans to address the issue, including investing in prefabricated and modular housing, and cutting municipal development charges in half for housing with multiple units. 
There was a pledge to deliver on another campaign promise - to end a goods and services tax for first-time homebuyers on houses costing less than C$1m. The King highlighted other plans to drive down costs for Canadians, including a tax cut for the lower-middle class. 
Another major issue during the campaign was crime. The speech contained promises to address tougher penalties for car thefts, home invasions, human trafficking and drug smuggling.
House Leader Alexandre Boulerice for the left-wing NDP said after the speech that there were ""big holes"" on issues like climate and women's rights. 
Canada has been under mounting pressure from the US and other Nato partners to increase its military spending, as it continues to fall short of the 2% of GDP on military spending target set out for alliance members.
Carney has committed to hitting that benchmark by 2030. 
Tuesday's speech contained commitments to ""rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting"" in its military; reinforcing defence relationships with European allies, including by joining Rearm Europe, a plan to dramatically increase defence spending on the continent; and to strengthen Canada's Arctic presence. 
Last week, Carney also said that ""high-level"" talks were taking place with the US about joining Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile defence system.

The search for a former Arkansas police chief convicted of rape and murder continues after he escaped from prison on Sunday. 
Grant Hardin was chief of police in Gateway, Arkansas - a small town of a few hundred residents on the state's border with Missouri - for around four months in 2016, according to the Associated Press.
The state's Department of Corrections said on social media that he escaped from the North Central Unit prison in Calico Rock at around 15:40 (20:40 GMT) on Sunday, where he had been incarcerated since 2017. 
The department added that Hardin was no longer in his prison uniform, and was ""wearing a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement"" when he escaped. 
Hardin, 56, remains at large. The Department of Corrections urged anyone with information to ""contact local law enforcement immediately"".
The department told the BBC that a ""multitude of agencies"" were involved in the search. 
The Pea Ridge Police Department also issued an alert on social media, saying Hardin ""has numerous connections and family in our area"". 
They warned the public not to approach him, saying he is ""considered armed and dangerous"".
The Izard Country Sheriff's Office told its community to ""stay vigilant, lock your house and vehicle doors and report any suspicious activity.""
The US Marshals Eastern Arkansas Fugitive Task Force is also assisting with search efforts, a spokesperson said on Tuesday.
The former prosecutor who helped put Hardin behind bars described him as a ""sociopath"", local television station KHBS 40/29 News reported. 
""Prison's not full of people who are all bad. It's full of a lot of people who just do bad things. Grant's different,"" former Benton County prosecutor Nathan Smith told the station. 
Grant Hardin pleaded guilty to first-degree murder -  the intentional killing of another person - after fatally shooting 59-year-old James Appleton in 2017. He was given a 30 year prison sentence.  
Mr Appleton worked in the city's water department. He was shot and killed while speaking to his brother-in-law, then-Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, on 23 February 2017, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. 
Police later found Mr Appleton's body inside a car. 
While serving time for Mr Appleton's murder, DNA evidence emerged linking Hardin to the long unsolved rape of Amy Harrison at Frank Tillery Elementary School in Rogers, Arkansas, in November 1997. 
According to an affiliate of CBS News, Ms Harrison was raped at gunpoint while she exited a classroom to go to the bathroom. 
Hardin pleaded guilty, and received a sentence of 50 years. 
Before becoming Gateway's police chief, Hardin served as an officer at the Eureka Springs Police Department (ESPD).
He resigned in October 1996 after he was informed by ESPD Chief Earl Hyatt that he was going to be fired for falsifying a police report, according to the CBS News-affiliated 5News.
""I was going to terminate him, but he resigned, and he was caught lying on a police report,"" Mr Hyatt reportedly said. 
Chief Hyatt also said he was not surprised at Hardin's conviction, telling 5News: ""He was just always a very violent, excessive person, and had a really bad temper.""
Cheryl Tillman, the mayor of Gateway, Arkansas, told local news outlet KATV she was worried Hardin would come after her and her family. Ms Tilman is the sister of Mr Appleton whom Hardin shot and killed.
""It's kind of scary,"" Tillman said. ""I don't think he'll be taken alive.""
His escape from prison comes just weeks after an unrelated incident in which 10 inmates broke out of a prison in New Orleans, Louisiana, after breaching the wall behind a toilet."

Could India's decades-long jungle insurgency finally be approaching its end?
Last week, the country's most-wanted Maoist, Nambala Keshava Rao - popularly known as Basavaraju - was killed along with 26 others in a major security operation in the central state of Chhattisgarh. Home Minister Amit Shah called it ""the most decisive strike"" against the insurgency in three decades. One police officer also died in the encounter.
Basavaraju's death marks more than a tactical victory - it signals a breach in the Maoists' last line of defence in Bastar, the forested heartland where the group carved out its fiercest stronghold since the 1980s.
Maoists, also known as ""Naxalites"" after the 1967 uprising in Naxalbari village in West Bengal, have regrouped over the decades to carve out a ""red corridor"" across central and eastern India - stretching from Jharkhand in the east to Maharashtra in the west and spanning more than a third of the country's districts. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh had described the insurgency as India's ""greatest internal security threat"".
The armed struggle for Communist rule has claimed nearly 12,000 lives since 2000, according to the South Asian Terrorism Portal, external. The rebels say they fight for the rights of indigenous tribes and the rural poor, citing decades of state neglect and land dispossession.
The Maoist movement - officially known as Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) - took formal shape in 2004 with the merger of key Marxist-Leninist groups into the CPI (Maoist). This party traces its ideological roots to a 1946 peasant uprising in the southern state of Telangana.
In 2023, Chhattisgarh saw the majority of Maoist violence, making it the worst-hit state
Now, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government pledging to end Maoism by March 2026, the battle-hardened rebellion stands at a crossroads: could this truly be the end - or just another pause in its long, bloody arc?
""There will be a lull. But Marxist-Leninist movements have transcended such challenges when the top leadership of the Naxalites were killed in the 70s and yet we are talking about Naxalism,"" said N Venugopal, a  journalist, social scientist and long-time observer of the movement, who is both a critic and sympathiser of the Maoists. 
One of the senior-most officials in India's home ministry who oversaw anti-Maoist operations, MA Ganapathy, holds a different view.
""At its core, the Maoist movement was an ideological struggle - but that ideology has lost traction, especially among the younger generation. Educated youth aren't interested anymore,"" says Mr Ganapathy.
""With Basavaraju neutralised, morale is low. They're on their last leg.""
The federal home ministry's latest report, external notes a 48% drop in violent incidents in Maoist-related violence - from 1,136 in 2013 to 594 in 2023 - and a 65% decline in related deaths, from 397 to 138. 
However, it acknowledges a slight rise in security force casualties in 2023 compared to 2022, attributed to intensified operations in core Maoist areas.
The report says Chhattisgarh remained the worst-affected state in 2023, accounting for 63% of all Left-Wing Extremism (LWE) incidents and 66% of the related deaths. 
Jharkhand followed, with 27% of the violence and 23% of the deaths. The remaining incidents were reported from Maharashtra, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.
Onlookers at the site of a 2023 Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh, where a blast killed 10 policemen
The collapse of Maoism in Chhattisgarh, a stronghold of the insurgency, offers key clues to the movement's broader decline.
A decade ago, the state's police were seen as weak, according to Mr Ganapathy.
""Today, precise state-led strikes, backed by central paramilitary forces, have changed the game. While paramilitary held the ground, state forces gathered intelligence and launched targeted operations. It was clear role delineation and coordination,"" he said.
Mr Ganapathy adds that access to mobile phones, social media, roads and connectivity have made people more aware and less inclined to support an armed underground movement.
""People have become aspirational, mobile phones and social media have become widespread and people are exposed to the outside world. Maoists also cannot operate in hiding in remote jungles while being out of sync with new social realities. 
""Without mass support, no insurgency can survive,"" he says.
A former Maoist sympathiser, who did not want to be named, pointed to a deeper flaw behind the movement's collapse: a political disconnect.
""They delivered real change - social justice in Telangana, uniting tribespeople in Chhattisgarh - but failed to forge it into a cohesive political force,"" he said.
At the heart of the failure, he argued, was a dated revolutionary vision: building isolated ""liberated zones"" beyond the state's reach and ""a theory to strike the state through a protracted people's war"".
""These pockets work only until the state pushes back. Then the zones collapse, and thousands die. It's time to ask - can a revolution really be led from cut-off forestlands in today's India?""
The CPI (Maoist)'s 2007 political document clings to a Mao-era strategy: of creating a ""liberated zone"" and ""encircling the cities from the countryside."" But the sympathiser was blunt: ""That doesn't work anymore.""
Ongoing operations by security forces have significantly weakened the Maoists 
The party still retains some popular support in a few isolated pockets, primarily in the tribal regions of eastern Maharashtra, southern Chhattisgarh and parts of Odisha and Jharkhand - but without a strong military base.
Ongoing operations by state forces have significantly weakened the Maoist military infrastructure in their strongholds in southern Chhattisgarh. Cadres and leaders are now being killed regularly, reflecting the rebels' growing inability to defend themselves.
Mr Venugopal believes the strategy needs rethinking - not abandonment.
The underground struggle has its place, he said, but ""the real challenge is blending it with electoral politics"".
In contrast, Mr Ganapathy sees little hope for the Maoists to mount a meaningful fightback in the near future and argues that the time has come for a different approach - dialogue.
""It would be wise for them to go for talks now and perhaps unconditionally or even lay down the conditions and let the government consider them. This is the time to approach the government instead of unnecessarily sacrificing their own cadres, without a purpose,"" he said.
Maoists enjoy support in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana from mainstream political parties. In Telangana, both the ruling Congress and the main opposition Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) have backed calls for a ceasefire, along with 10 smaller Left parties - an effort widely seen as aimed at protecting the group's remaining leaders and cadres. 
The Maoist movement, rooted in past struggles against caste oppression, still carries social legitimacy in parts of these states. Civil society activists have also joined the push for a truce.
""We, along with other civil rights groups, demanded a two-step process - an immediate ceasefire followed by peace talks,"" said Ranjit Sur, general secretary of the Kolkata-based group Association for Protection of Democratic Rights.
Maoist-affected states remain resilient strongholds in part because they are rich in minerals - making them sites of intense resource battles. Mr Venugopal believes this is key to the CPI (Maoist's) enduring presence.
Chhattisgarh, for instance, is India's sole producer of tin concentrates and moulding sand, and a leading source of coal, dolomite, bauxite and high-grade iron ore, according to the ministry of mines, external. 
It accounts for 36% of the country's tin, 20% iron ore, 18% coal, 11% dolomite and 4% of diamond and marble reserves. Yet, despite strong interest, mining companies - both global and national - have long struggled to access these resources.
""Multinational companies couldn't enter because the Maoist movement, built on the slogan 'Jal, Jangal, Jameen (Water, Forest, Land),' asserted that forests belong to tribespeople - not corporations,"" Mr Venugopal said.
But with the Maoists now weakened, at least four Chhattisgarh mines, external are set to go to ""preferred bidders"" after successful auctions in May, according to an official notification. 
Mr Venugopal believes that the resistance won't die with the death of Maoist leaders.
""Leaders may fall, but the anger remains. Wherever injustice exists, there will be movements. We may not call them Maoism anymore - but they'll be there."""

Before the events of 3 December 2024, Lee Jaeâmyung's path to South Korea's presidency was littered with obstacles.
Ongoing legal cases, investigations for corruption and allegations of abusing power all looked set to derail the former opposition leader's second presidential bid.
Then a constitutional crisis changed everything.
On that night, former president Yoon Suk Yeol's abortive attempt to invoke martial law set in motion a series of events that appears to have cleared the path for Lee.
Now, as the Democratic Party candidate, he is the frontrunner to win South Korea's election on 3 June.
It's a dramatic reversal of fortunes for the 61-year-old, who at the time of Yoon's martial law declaration stood convicted of making false statements during his last presidential campaign in 2022.
Those charges still cast a long shadow over Lee, and could yet threaten his years-long pursuit of the top job. But they are also just the latest in a string of controversies that have dogged him throughout his political career.
A rags-to-riches origin story combined with a bullish political style has made Lee into a divisive figure in South Korea.
""Lee Jae-myung's life has been full of ups and downs, and he often takes actions that stir controversy,"" Dr Lee Jun-han, professor of political science and international studies at Incheon National University, tells the BBC.
These actions typically include attempts at progressive reform â such as a pledge, made during his 2022 presidential campaign, to implement universal basic income scheme â which challenge the existing power structure and status quo in South Korea.
""Because of this, some people strongly support him, while others distrust or dislike him,"" Dr Lee says. ""He is a highly controversial and unconventional figure â very much an outsider who has made a name for himself in a way that doesn't fit traditional Democratic Party norms.""
Lee's humble origins and controversial political style have made him a divisive figure
In a recent memoir, Lee described his childhood as ""miserable"". Born in 1963 in a mountain village in Andong, Gyeongbuk Province, he was the fifth of five sons and two daughters, and - due to his family's difficult circumstances - skipped middle school to illegally enter the workforce.
As a young factory worker, Lee suffered an industrial accident where his fingers got caught in a factory power belt, and at the age of 13 suffered a permanent injury to his arm after his wrist was crushed by a press machine.
Lee later applied for and was allowed to sit entrance exams for high school and university, passing in 1978 and 1980 respectively. He went on to study law with a full scholarship, and passed the Bar Examination in 1986.
In 1992, he married his wife Kim Hye-kyung, with whom he has two children.
He worked as a human rights lawyer for almost two decades before entering politics in 2005, joining the social-liberal Uri Party, a predecessor of the Democratic Party of Korea and the ruling party at the time.
While his poor upbringing has drawn scorn from members of South Korea's upper class, Lee's success in building his political career from the ground up has earned him support from working-class voters and those who feel disenfranchised by the political elite.
He was elected mayor of Seongnam in 2010, rolling out a series of free welfare policies during his tenure, and in 2018 became governor of the broader Gyeonggi Province. 
Lee would go on to receive acclaim for his response to the Covid-19 pandemic, during which he clashed with the central government due to his insistence on providing universal relief grants for all residents of the province.
It was also during this time that Lee became the Democratic Party's final presidential candidate for the first time in October 2021 â losing by 0.76 percentage points. Less than a year later, in August 2022, he was elected as the party's leader.
From that point on, Dr Lee says, Lee dialled back on the controversial, fire-and-brimstone approach for which he had become notorious â opting instead to play it safe and keep a low profile.
""After [Lee's] term as a governor, his reformist image faded somewhat as he focused more on his presidential ambitions,"" he says. ""Still, on certain issues â like addressing past wrongs [during the Japanese colonial era], welfare and corruption â he has built a loyal and passionate support base by taking a firm and uncompromising stance.""
This uncompromising attitude has its detractors, with many members and supporters of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) viewing Lee as aggressive and abrasive in his approach. 
Lee's political career has also been marred by a series of scandals â including a drink driving incident in 2004, disputes with relatives in the late 2010s and allegations of an extramarital affair that emerged in 2018.
While in other parts of the world voters have shown forgiveness and even support for controversial politicians, in South Korea â a country that is still relatively conservative in what it expects of public figures â such scandals have not typically played well.
In recent years, Lee's political ambitions have been saddled with even more pressing controversies - including the ongoing legal cases that continue to hang over him, threatening to hamstring if not scuttle his chances at election.
One of these concerns a string of high-profile charges, including corruption, bribery and breach of trust, associated with a land development project in 2023. 
Another, perhaps more critical legal battle concerns allegations that Lee made a knowingly false statement during a debate in the last presidential campaign.
During the debate, which aired on South Korean television in December 2021, Lee had denied personally knowing Kim Moon-ki, a key figure in a corruption-ridden land development scandal who had taken his own life just days earlier.
Prosecutors allege that claim was false, thus violating the Public Official Election Act, and in November 2024 Lee was convicted of the false statements charge and given a one-year suspended prison sentence. 
Then, in March, an appeals court cleared him of the charges â only for that ruling to be overturned by South Korea's Supreme Court. At the time of writing, the case is still awaiting a verdict.
Other threats against Lee's future political ambitions posed a more fatal danger.
Lee, who survived an assassination attempt in 2024, now campaigns behind bulletproof glass and wears a bulletproof vest
In January 2024, while answering questions from reporters outside the construction site of a planned airport in Busan, Lee was stabbed in the neck by a man who had approached him asking for an autograph. 
The injury to Lee's jugular vein, though requiring extensive surgery, was not critical - but he now campaigns behind bulletproof glass, wearing a bulletproof vest, surrounded by agents carrying ballistic briefcases. 
The assailant, who had written an eight-page manifesto and wanted to ensure that Lee never became president, was later sentenced to 15 years in prison.
The attack raised concerns about deepening political polarisation in South Korea - embodied perhaps most publicly in the bitter rivalry between Lee and Yoon, and more privately in the country's increasingly extreme online discourse.
In December 2023, just weeks before Lee was attacked, a survey sponsored by the newspaper Hankyoreh found that more than 50% of respondents said they felt South Korea's political divide worsening.
Some claim that, as Democratic Party leader, Lee played a major role in fuelling the problem, frequently blocking motions by Yoon's government and effectively rendering him a lame duck president.
Such constant stonewalling by the Democratic Party only exacerbated Yoon's leadership struggles - which also included repeated impeachment attempts against administration officials and constant opposition to his budget.
Finally, as the pressure against him mounted, the former president took the drastic step of declaring martial law.
Yoon's declaration of martial law on 3 December - made in a self-proclaimed bid to eliminate ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea sympathisers - served as the catalyst for Lee to emerge as a leading presidential candidate.
Within hours of the declaration, Lee appealed to the public via a livestream broadcast and urged them to assemble in protest outside the National Assembly building in central Seoul.
Thousands responded, clashing with police and blocking military units as opposition lawmakers rushed into the assembly building, clambering over fences and walls in a desperate attempt to block Yoon's order.
Lee was among them, climbing over the fence to enter the National Assembly and helping to pass the resolution to lift martial law.
Former president Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law plunged South Korea into a political maelstrom
The Democratic Party later decided to impeach President Yoon - a decision that was unanimously upheld by South Korea's Constitutional Court on 4 April, 2025.
It was then that Lee began the path to a full-fledged election bid, announcing his resignation as leader of the Democratic Party on 9 April ahead of his presidential run. In the Democratic Party presidential primary held on April 27, he was selected as the general candidate with overwhelming support.
The result of Yoon's abortive martial law attempt was a political maelstrom from which South Korea is still reeling: a constitutional crisis that ended the former president's career and left his PPP in tatters.
But of the small few who have managed to leverage that chaos to their advantage, none have benefitted more than Lee.
Now the controversial presidential candidate awaits the verdict on his political future - not only from the South Korean people, but also the courts. 
If his guilty ruling is ultimately confirmed, Lee will likely lose his seat in the National Assembly. As a candidate, that would prevent him from running for president for a period of five years.
But with the courts having now approved Lee's request to postpone his legal hearings until after the election, another possibility has emerged: that Lee, who remains the electoral favourite, could be convicted after winning the presidency.
And that could mean that South Korea, having just endured a months-long period of political turmoil, may not be done with its leadership dramas just yet."

Authorities said the arrests were in connection with investigations into a recent abduction attempt in Nantes and the attempted kidnapping of a woman and child in Paris in May. 
The incidents have raised concerns about the safety of those with cryptocurrency fortunes which could make them a target for criminals seeking ransom payments.
Earlier this month French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau vowed to bolster security around the country's crypto executives and their families.
A total of 24 people have been taken into custody, French media report.
The arrests were connected to an unsuccessful attempt by a masked gang to abduct the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency chief in Paris on 13 May.
The pair were described by French media as relatives of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium.
Arrests were also made over a kidnapping attempt against a person with ties to the crypto sector which was foiled by police in the Nantes region of western France on Monday, local media outlets reported.
Police intervened before the attack was carried out, police sources said.
Other incidents of kidnappings or attempted kidnappings have taken place across the country in recent months, including the case of the father of a cryptocurrency millionaire who was bundled into a van by men in balaclavas in Paris on 1 May. 
Le Parisien newspaper said his kidnappers demanded his wealthy son pay a â¬5-7m ransom (Â£4.2-5.9m).
The victim had one finger missing when he was rescued by police days later in a house in Palaiseau, south of Paris, according to French media.
These incidents follow the kidnapping of David Balland, co-founder of the cryptocurrency firm Ledger, who was abducted with his wife at their home in central France in January.
The pair were rescued by police within days and Mr Balland also had a finger cut off, French media reported. 
The criminals had demanded a â¬10m ransom. Six men and a woman were previously arrested in connection with that case.
In response to the spate of attacks against those with links to the cryptocurrency sector, Retailleau held an emergency meeting with industry leaders in mid-May.
In the meeting, he promised the ""entire state apparatus"" was ""fully mobilised to track down the perpetrators and instigators of this violence and put them out of action"", according to French media reports."

The search for the remains of a pregnant Irish woman in County Offaly has come to an end.
Fiona Pender was last seen at about 06:00 on 23 August 1996 at her flat on Church Street, Tullamore.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) say their investigation into the murder of the 25 year old is ongoing but the results of the searches are not being released for operational purposes.
Ms Pender's family have been updated, police added.
GardaÃ­ searched an open ground area close to Killeigh, about 5km from Tullamore
Since Monday morning gardaÃ­ searched a small remote area at Graigue, near Killeigh village, just off the main road between Tullamore and Portlaoise.
The investigation has been reclassified as a murder investigation based on the entirety of the information available to investigators.
Ms Pender went missing in a decade when a number of other young women also disappeared without trace in the same province of Leinster.
But police sources have always indicated that they do not believe her disappearance was linked to any of the other cases.
On Monday, gardaÃ­ confirmed that the missing person investigation has been re-classified as a murder investigation
Over the last 28 years, gardaÃ­ have conducted significant inquiries and what they describe as a sustained investigation.
Investigators say they have collated thousands of documents and reports, taken more than 300 statements of evidence and retained a number of exhibits.
A number of extensive searches have also been carried out.
According to police, five people have been arrested and detained in connection with this investigation.
No one has been brought to justice for her disappearance.
Ms Pender was described as 5'5"" in height, with long blonde hair and she was wearing bright coloured clothing and white leggings when she went missing.
At the time of her disappearance she was seven months pregnant. 
GardaÃ­ has issued a fresh appeal for anyone who may have information about the case to come forward.
They have also appealed to anyone who has previously come forward but felt at the time they could not provide police with all the information about Ms Pender's disappearance."

Outside the Senate building later, another voice from the crowd shouted: ""Thanks for coming King Charles"" in a voice full of emotion - as the King himself had sounded at the end of his speech.
But what was never mentioned was what the speech was really about: US President Donald Trump.
There was a promise to ""protect Canadians and their sovereign rights"", but with diplomatic discretion, there was no mention of who might be threatening the country's independence.

Claims by Trump that Canada would be the 51st US state hung over this speech, but his name was never uttered.
Not when the speech talked of the virtues of ""open trade"" (ie, not tariffs) or when it talked of a ""critical moment"" in which ""democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom"" must be protected.
And there was no one named as making it necessary to guard the country's ""fundamental rights and freedoms"".
There might even have been an olive branch, with a promise by the Canadian government to do more to stop fentanyl crossing the border, a drug that was the subject of accusations by the US administration. But there was no mention of Trump by name.
The opening of parliament followed a general election in which Mark Carney had been brought to power on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment.
Headdresses and traditional clothes were on show at the opening of Parliament
The speech was written on the advice of the Canadian government, but there was a great deal of symbolism in the King reading it out. The King of Canada was in town.
Inviting King Charles seemed to have paid off for Carney, who afterwards said how well the speech had been delivered. ""Our sovereignty is strong,"" said Carney. 
From the parliamentarians inside the packed chamber to the crowds pressed up against the railings outside, the King's visit was seen as sticking up for Canada when it was under pressure from its bigger neighbour.
Compared with openings of Parliament in Westminster, this was a more dressed-down affair. No crowns or robes, with the King looking businesslike in a suit. 
Showing this really is a relaxed country, the former PM, Justin Trudeau, was wearing a pair of green trainers.
Justin Trudeau made a fashion statement with green trainers
A theme of this brief royal visit has been paying respects to the First Nations people and the King noted that parliament was meeting on the territory of the Algonquin people.
Among the parliamentarians were many representatives of First Nations communities, dressed in traditional outfits and spectacular headdresses. The speech, delivered in French and English, made a virtue of the country's diverse roots.
Before the King's arrival, there was an unmistakable sense of anticipation with the sober lawmakers taking a few quick selfies before the big royal moment. There was that nervous buzz ahead of something important.
There would be a long list of government plans and policies, but there was a bigger historic feel to events, with a huge media encampment outside and crowds lining the streets.
The opening of parliament took place in Canada's Senate, which is currently using temporary accommodation while its own building is renovated.
The building being used by the Senate used to be Ottawa's main railway station. You could still see how the floor of the chamber had once been the station concourse.

A different type of king, Elvis Presley, had come through here on a train journey in 1957. If there were suspicious minds here about whether King Charles would stand up for Canada, he was able to put that to rest.
In the warm Ottawa sunshine, there were crowds sending their own message by turning out to see the King. Even a fleeting visit here soon shows how deeply people have been upset by their near neighbours and allies in the US.
There seemed to be a genuine sense of relief that the King was there and showing support. The King also looked pleased, standing outside the Senate, holding a quick walkabout while a motorcade of oversized black cars was waiting to drive him away. He later spoke of the ""warmest of welcomes"".
He waved before he left, having a last look around, towards the crowds and towards the cameras. Was there someone south of the border watching?
The US state department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce responded to the speech: ""I'm a fan of King Charles. And of Prince William and Princess Kate. I think they're a great family.""

Russian forces are making gains in the Ukrainian north-eastern region of Sumy - a development that may be linked to Moscow's attempts to create ""buffer zones"" along the border, Ukrainian regional authorities have said.
The head of the Sumy region Oleh Hryhorov said Russian forces have seized four villages and that fighting is continuing near other settlements in the area ""with the aim of setting up a so-called 'buffer zone'"".
Russia maintains it has captured six villages in Sumy so far. 
Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to create ""security buffer zones"" along the border. ""Enemy firing points are being actively suppressed, the work is under way,"" he said. 
The buffer zones would be created to provide ""additional support"" to areas in Russia which border Ukraine's Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv regions, Putin said.
In a statement on Facebook on Monday, Sumy's Hryhorov wrote: ""The enemy is continuing attempts to advance with the aim of setting up a so-called 'buffer zone',""
He added that the villages of Novenke, Basivka, Veselivka and Zhuravka - all in Sumy - had been occupied.
Kyiv has not yet officially stated that Russian troops are in the Sumy region and, when contacted by the BBC, Hryhorov declined to confirm the information he shared on Monday, saying only the military could comment on front-line activities.
The General Staff's daily briefings only mentioned clashes and other military activities in ""the Kursk direction"" - meaning towards the border with Russia - without naming any specific locations.
The Ukrainian army's group of forces that coordinate military activities in the region declined the BBC's request for comment, indicating that information about the Russian advancement in the north is an extremely sensitive issue for Ukrainian authorities.
However, in his address on Monday night Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky mentioned Russia's ""preparation for new offensives"" â which was largely interpreted as a reference to the events in the Sumy region.
Deep State map, a group that monitors the latest front-line developments in Ukraine, marked four Ukrainian villages as fully controlled by Russian forces even before Hyrhorov's announcement. 
Deep State's co-founder Roman Pohorily said that Russian troops have been pushing in those areas since March.
Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets confirmed this, although he pointed out that Russia's advance has been very slow - about 1km (0.6 miles) in the past two weeks. Mr Mashovets also said Moscow recently relocated new units from the Donbas - to Sumy region.
Colonel Vadym Mysnyk, a spokesperson for a formation of the ground forces that is involved in defending the Sumy region, said Russian forces mostly use small groups on motorbikes and buggies during their attacks.
The movement of larger armoured vehicles could be quickly spotted by drones and destroyed, Col Mysnyk explained. On the battlefield, speed and mobility are crucial.
But the Sumy region has regularly come under attack by Russian air strikes and artillery fire, with the regional administration reporting that since Saturday, Russia has dropped more than 30 guided bombs on the area.
One of the biggest attacks took place last month when ballistic missiles hit the city of Sumy killing 34 people. Several weeks later, drones hit an intercity bus killing nine people.
Russia targets residential buildings, hospitals and civilian vehicles to spread panic among the population, Col Mysnyk claimed. Russia denies that it targets civilians in strikes, saying they are aimed at military targets.
Local authorities say evacuation is taking place in 202 settlements close to the front line, which makes up a third of all territorial communities of the region. 
Serhiy Grabskiy, a retired colonel and a military expert, agreed that the advances in Sumy are part of Moscow's plan to create a buffer zone. 
Grabskiy said Russia's main strategic goal is to seize the Donbas region in the east, where the most intensive fighting is taking place.
Considering the number of troops they have, Russia ""cannot concentrate major forces to go deep in the north"", Grabskiy argued.
He called the Sumy region a ""zone of distraction"" - as by maintaining pressure in the north, Russia forces Ukraine to spread its resources and weaken positions in key front-line areas. 
The US-based Institute for the Study of War think tank also reports that any success in Sumy could be used by Putin as a leverage and justification for new territorial demands as part of future peace negotiations.
However, observers agree there is no immediate threat of a major breakthrough in the Sumy region. 
Based on the speed of their gains in the region so far, it is unlikely that in the near future Russian forces could capture a major city like Sumy, which had a population of 250,000 before the invasion.
Mr Pohorily of Deep State said Ukrainian troops have managed to stabilise the front line. ""It's been almost three months since [Russia] started their operation in the Sumy region and yet, they are still at the border areas,"" he said.
Col Mysnyk claimed that Ukraine has built defence lines along the entire border since 2022 and at present they're much better prepared to stop the Russian forces than they were at the start of the Russian invasion.
But those measures may not last long if the Kremlin's priorities change and Moscow sends greater forces to Sumy."

The Irish government has apologised to the family of a cyclist who was killed in a hit-and-run caused by a driver who should have been in jail.
Shane O'Farrell, 23, was struck by a car while cycling near his home in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, in 2011.
The driver, Zigimantas Gridziuska, had more than 40 convictions at the time, including some in Northern Ireland.
A formal apology was issued by the Republic of Ireland's justice minister Jim O'Callaghan.
The taoiseach (Ireland's prime minister) and tÃ¡naiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) spoke in the chamber on Tuesday afternoon.
Speaking in the DÃ¡il Ãireann on Tuesday, tÃ¡naiste Simon Harris TD said: ""We acknowledge failures in the Courts Service and the criminal justice system that exposed Shane to danger on the fateful day of his tragic death.""
The O'Farrell family have campaigned for a public inquiry into their son's death.
The body of the law graduate was found nearly 60 yards (54m) from the point where he was hit by a car on 2 August 2011.
Gridziuska, a Lithuanian national, left the scene of the fatal crash but the following day he handed himself into gardaÃ­ (Irish police).
He had been a regular defendant in courts in Monaghan, Cavan and Louth in the years prior to the killing, according to RTÃ.
Simon Harris said he supports the government's apology
In the January, before the fatal crash, a ruling from Monaghan Circuit Court meant Gridziuska should have been in jail at the time of Mr O'Farrell's death.
Instead, he remained on bail.
Another prison sentence handed down in February 2011 was also not imposed.
The Court Services of Ireland previously said Gridziuska's prison sentences were never served because of what it described as an administrative error.
As part of their long-running campaign, the O'Farrell family have previously travelled to Belfast and Brussels to raise their case in Stormont and the European Parliament.
Harris hopes that the apology can ""in some small way can start to heal the wounds left by Shane's untimely death"".
""The harrowing events of that day in August 2011 were just the beginning of a living nightmare for the O'Farrell family,"" he said.
Harris added that the government has made ""a number of decisions"" which have been recommended by the minister and have risen from the campaign of the O'Farrell family.
He hopes these decisions will ""bring about meaningful change"" and said that Minister O'Callaghan will outline these decisions in more detail.
""As tÃ¡naiste, I fully endorse and support the apology."""

The National Assembly approved the bill, which is backed by President Emmanuel Macron, by 305 votes to 199. It will now go to the upper house, the Senate, before a second reading in the National Assembly. Supporters hope it will become law by 2027.
It would make France the eighth country in the European Union to allow a version of assisted dying.
As currently framed, the French version would be not as permissive as in the Netherlands or neighbouring Belgium, which were the first countries in Europe to legalise assisted dying.
A separate bill creating a right to palliative care went through unopposed. It is estimated that 48% of French patients who require palliative care do not get it.
Macron said the decision to approve both bills was ""an important step"" in a social media post on Tuesday.
""With respect for sensitivities, doubts and hopes, the path of fraternity that I hoped for is gradually opening up"", he wrote on X.
Much of the two-week debate in the Assembly had focused on the conditions under which a patient could qualify for assisted dying.
The approved formula is for ""people struck by a serious and incurable disease"" that is ""life-threatening and in its advanced or terminal phases"", who are in ""constant physical or psychological suffering"".
The patient would have to be able to ""freely manifest his or her intention"". They would have to wait 48 hours and then confirm it.
Once authorised, the lethal dose would be self-administered by the patient; or by a medical assistant if the patient were incapable.
Authorisation would be provided by a doctor, but only after consultation with peers.
MPs were allowed a free vote on the bill â a reflection of how differences of opinion on the matter defy party lines. Broadly though, the measure was backed by the centre and left and opposed on the right and populist right.
Conservative critics â echoing views of the once-dominant Catholic Church â were concerned that definitions in the bill were too broad, opening the way for assisted dying for patients who might have years to live.
As in other countries where the ethical issues have been hotly debated, opponents fear that vulnerable elderly people could feel under pressure to die in order to remove a burden from their families.
In a demonstration against the bill outside the National Assembly on Saturday, one 44-year-old woman suffering from Parkinson's disease said it would be like a ""loaded pistol left on my bedside table"".
Some left-wingers wanted to toughen the government's bill by widening access to assisted dying to minors, non-French nationals and patients who leave instructions before going into a coma.
Under the bill, medical staff who oppose assisted dying would not be obliged to carry it out. However, it would be a crime punishable by two years in jail to try to block an act of assisted dying.
Conservatives wanted to create another crime â of incitement to assisted dying.  But this amendment was rejected by MPs.
Prime Minister FranÃ§ois Bayrou, who is a practising Catholic, said that if he had a vote on the bill he would abstain. As he is not an MP, he did not have a vote."

Hundreds of lawyers have called on the UK government to use ""all available means"" to stop the fighting in Gaza, including reviewing trade ties with Israel and imposing sanctions and travel bans on Israeli ministers.
Some 828 UK-based or qualified legal experts, among them former Supreme Court justices, signed a letter, external to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Monday.
They warned ""genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza"" from Israel's blockade of food and aid and its new military offensive, which has killed hundreds of Palestinians there in the past fortnight.
Israel has strongly denied genocide allegations, claims which are also being examined by the International Court of Justice.

The group of legal experts includes former Supreme Court Justices Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption, former chair of the Criminal Bar Association of England and Wales Andrew Hall KC, and several professors from Oxford and Cambridge universities.
Their letter comes amid a wave of increased criticism from Israel's Western allies, condemning its latest military offensive, which began in mid-May, and the impact of its blockade. The blockade was in full effect for 11 weeks from 2 March.
Last week, the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statement condemning Israel's ""egregious"" expansion of military operations in Gaza. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the British, French and Canadian leaders of ""siding with Hamas"", saying the offensive was aimed at freeing the remaining 58 hostages held by the group.
But UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the escalation ""morally unjustifiable"". The UK last week suspended trade deal talks, summoned Israel's ambassador and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers.
Netanyahu has declared Israel's intention to take over the Gaza Strip and displace residents from the north to the south. 
The operation has seen about a 100 Gazans killed per day in strikes in its first week, according to the territory's Hamas-run rescue authorities and health ministry.
On Monday, the group of legal experts said in a detailed 36-page letter that Israel's May offensive was ""a grave violation"" of international law, and also violated the Palestinian people's legal right to self-determination.
The group of lawyers, legal experts and retired judges expressed their ""deep concern over the worsening catastrophe"" in Gaza and the occupied West Bank where violations of international law were ""being committed and are further threatened"" by Israel.
""First, genocide is being perpetrated in Gaza or, at a minimum, there is a serious risk of genocide occurring,"" the legal experts wrote.
They said this had been caused by Israel's blockade  - and the trickle of aid now being allowed in was ""gravely insufficient.""
They said the UK and all countries were legally obliged to ""prevent and punish genocide"". 
""The UK's actions to date have failed to meet those standards"", they said, but they welcomed the ""indication"" of stronger action in last week's statement.
The UK must immediately impose financial and immigration sanctions on Israeli ministers suspected of ""unlawful conduct"", to help secure a ceasefire, the lawyers wrote.
The letter also called for the UK to review existing trade ties with Israel, impose trade sanctions on the country and also suspend the UK's ""2030 Roadmap"" with Israel - an agreement between the UK and Israel on defence, technology and science, culture, the arts and other areas.
They called on the government to ensure it would adhere to its obligations as a member of the International Criminal Court to act on arrest warrants issued by the court. Netanyahu is currently wanted by the court for alleged war crimes in Gaza and breaches of international law, charges he emphatically denies.
The letter is the group's latest since the war began in October 2023. Its first missive was issued weeks into the conflict, where it raised concerns about the UK government selling arms to Israel.
The legality of the UK's decisions concerning arms sales is now being examined by the High Court of England and Wales.
Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 54,056 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,901 since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March following a two-month ceasefire, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
On Tuesday, Germany and Finland also spoke out, saying Israel must allow humanitarian aid into Gaza immediately. 
""We must put pressure on Israel to ensure the aid truly reaches its target,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters alongside Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo in Finland. 
""But it is also crucial that Hamas must not prevent humanitarian aid from arriving.""
Merz, who has strongly criticised Israel in recent days, said events in Gaza were ""in no way acceptable"". He described the effect on Gazan civilians as ""excessive"" and called for an end to the killing and suffering.
""This is a terrible human catastrophe and we must be able to tackle it,"" Orpo added.
Sweden on Tuesday also summoned the Israeli ambassador to its foreign ministry, and called on the country to ""immediately ensure safe and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza"".
The Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement that Israel had a right to defend itself but ""the current way the war is waged is unacceptable""."

War-torn Sudan is now ""on the brink"" of a public health disaster as cholera and other deadly diseases spread, aid group, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has warned.
In just one week, Sudan's Health Ministry recorded that 172 people had died because of a cholera outbreak, posting on Facebook that most of the new cases were in Khartoum state, external. 
According to local doctors, cited by Sudanese media, external, drone attacks have caused power outages at water purification stations, which has left people with no choice but to use unclean water.
IRC country director for Sudan Eatizaz Yousif said the civil war - now in its third year -  was ""fuelling the resurgence of cholera"".
In a statement, the IRC emphasised that cholera vaccine coverage was ""low"", external and ""essential supplies dwindling"".
The medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has warned of reports of ""thousands of suspected cholera cases"", external in Khartoum since the middle of last month.
Its medical co-ordinator in the country, Slaymen Ammar, stated that ""the conflict has clearly compromised basic infrastructure"".
In a press release, he said that healthcare in parts of the capital was ""either unavailable or unaffordable"", adding that ""many of the remaining health workers had no choice but to leave"" due to fighting.
Mr Ammar adds that the few remaining health facilities are overwhelmed.
As many as 500 cases of cholera were reported in just one day in the past week in Khartoum, MSF said.
Aside from the Khartoum area, cases were also cited in northern and southern Sudan, the AFP news agency reports.
Most people with cholera have mild symptoms or none at all. 
However, the disease can be a fatal if it causes severe diarrhoea, requiring antibiotics and IV fluids for treatment, according to the World Health Organization.
More than 150,000 people have been killed during Sudan's conflict, which began over two years ago when Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began a vicious struggle for power.
Millions have been forced from their homes and the conflict has plunged the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The grieving mother of a woman who died after unknowingly taking a fatal mixture of drugs in Thailand has warned people to beware of buying drugs abroad.
Rebecca Turner, 36, from Bexhill-on-Sea in East Sussex, was found dead alongside her boyfriend, Sam Melnick, in their hotel room in Bangkok on 15 March 2024.
A toxicology report found evidence of heroin, codeine, diazepam and trazodone in her bloodstream, and assistant coroner Laura Bradford said Ms Turner died as a result of ""drug toxicity"".

She added: ""There are many deaths out there through the misuse of drugs, and with what's in these drugs, it's just not worth it because it's the parents that sit there picking up the pieces.
""Every day it kills me, every day I cry. I can't get over it and no mother would get over it.""
The mother added that her daughter had thought she was taking cocaine, but with ""everything else mixed in it, it was deadly"".

This article contains distressing descriptions of death
Swedish authorities have charged a convicted terrorist over the 2015 killing of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death in Syria.
Osama Krayem, 32 - a Swedish citizen - was on Tuesday charged with war and terrorism crimes relating to the death of Moaz al-Kasasbeh.
Krayem is currently in prison after being convicted for his role in the 2015 and 2016 terror attacks in Paris and Brussels respectively. 
The BBC has contacted his lawyer for comment relating to the latest allegations. He has previously denied the charges, Swedish public broadcaster SVT reported.
Krayem's trial is expected to begin on 4 June.
""It is painful for my parents to be confronted with this event again, but we are grateful that the Swedish authorities want to give us justice,"" the pilot's brother, Jawdat al-Kasasbeh, told Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Radio following the announcement of the charges.
The Swedish Prosecution Authority last week announced they planned to charge a man with the ""execution"" of Lt Kasasbeh, along with other suspected members of the Islamic State (IS) group. 
Jordan confirmed the death of Lt Kasasbeh in 2015, following the circulation of a gruesome video published online by IS that appeared to show the 26-year-old being burned alive in a cage.
He was captured when his plane came down near the city of Raqqa during a mission against IS in December 2014. 
At the time of Lt Kasasbeh's death, Jordan - which was part of a US-led coalition fighting IS in Syria during the civil war - had been attempting to secure his release as part of a prisoner swap. 
Swedish prosecutors said in its statement last week the offences Krayem has now been charged with took place between 24 December 2014 and 3 February 2015.
They added an investigation had shown Krayem ""armed and masked, together with others forced the pilot into a metal cage"". 
""The cage was subsequently set on fire by one of the co-perpetrators, and the pilot died as a consequence of the fire.""
Krayem is originally from the Swedish city of Malmo and is thought to have travelled to Syria in September 2014 to fight for IS. 
In June 2022, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in the November 2015 Paris terror attacks - in which 130 people were killed - and for planning a separate attack on Amsterdam airport.
A year later, he was also found guilty of terrorist murder for his role in the Brussels attacks that killed 32 people.
He has been temporarily transferred from France to Sweden in order to participate in this latest trial."

A controversial new aid distribution group backed by the US and Israel has begun working in Gaza.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said lorry loads of food had been delivered to secure sites on Monday and that distribution had begun. Hundreds of Palestinians collected food parcels from a site in southern city of Rafah on Tuesday.
The GHF, which uses armed American security contractors, aims to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to the 2.1 million people in Gaza, where experts have warned of a looming famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade that was recently eased.
A UN spokesman said the operation was a ""distraction from what is actually needed"" and urged Israel to reopen all crossings.
The UN and many aid groups have refused to co-operate with GHF's plans, which they say contradict humanitarian principles and appear to ""weaponise aid"".
They have warned that the system will practically exclude those with mobility issues, force further displacement, expose thousands of people to harm, make aid conditional on political and military aims, and set an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery around the world.
Israel says an alternative to the current aid system is needed to stop Hamas stealing aid, which the group denies doing.
In a statement sent to journalists on Monday night, GHF announced that it had ""commenced operations in Gaza"" and delivered ""truck loads of food to its Secure Distribution Sites, where distribution to the Gazan people began"".
""More trucks with aid will be delivered [on Tuesday], with the flow of aid increasing each day,"" it added.
Handout photos showed three lorries laden with pallets of supplies at an unspecified location and just over a dozen men carrying away boxes.
The BBC has asked the GHF how many lorry loads of aid got in and how many people were able to pick up aid, but it has not yet received a response.
On Tuesday, the Israeli military said in a statement that two distribution sites located in the Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood of Rafah and the Morag Corridor, which separates the city from the rest of Gaza, had begun operating and distributing food to thousands of families.
Hundreds of Palestinians were seen queueing at the site in Tal al-Sultan, where food parcels were handed out by Palestinian workers.
""We stood in a long queue. We did not deal with the Israeli army or any American staff,"" one recipient told a local journalist.
A Palestinian working with one of the local companies involved in the operation told the BBC that ""dozens of Palestinian workers from three Palestinian companies are overseeing the distribution process, which runs daily from 09:00 to 19:00"".
The employee, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media, added: ""The distribution is co-ordinated with five American security personnel, who are present on-site, but there are no Israelis involved in the process.""
But many Palestinians stayed away from the sites.
A displaced woman from the neighbouring city of Khan Younis expressed concern about having to cross Israeli military lines to collect aid from the GHF's sites.
""We have no idea what awaits us there - whether we will return or be lost forever. We are being forced to risk our lives just to feed our children,"" she told BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily radio programme.
A man who was still living in Khan Younis despite an Israeli evacuation order said he would ""refuse to accept American aid under these terms"", and warned that it marked the beginning of a ""broader strategy of displacement"".
When asked to comment on the GHF's work by reporters in Geneva, a spokesman for the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke, said: ""We do not participate in this modality for the reasons that we have given.""
""It is a distraction from what is actually needed, which is the reopening of all the crossings into Gaza, a secure environment within Gaza, and faster facilitation of permissions and final approvals of all the emergency supplies that we have just outside the border,"" he added.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says lorries delivered food to its ""Secure Distribution Sites"" on Monday
Under the GHF's mechanism, Palestinians must collect boxes containing food and basic hygiene items for their families from four distribution sites in southern and central Gaza.
The sites will be secured by American contractors, with Israeli troops patrolling the perimeters. To access them, Palestinians were expected to have to undergo identity checks and screening for involvement with Hamas.
UN and other aid agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with any scheme that fails to respect fundamental humanitarian principles.
Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief, has described the GHF as ""militarised, privatised, politicised"".
""The people behind it are military - ex-CIA, ex-security people. There is a security firm that is going to work closely with one party to the armed conflict, the Israel Defense Forces,"" he told the BBC on Monday. ""They will have some hubs... where people will be screened according to the needs of one side in this conflict - Israel.""
""We cannot have a party to the conflict decide where, how and who will get the aid,"" he added.
On Sunday night, Jake Wood resigned as the GHF's executive director, saying the group's aid distribution system could not work in a way that would be able to fulfil the principles of ""humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence"".
The GHF's board rejected the criticism, accusing ""those who benefit from the status quo"" of being more focused on ""tearing this apart than on getting aid in"".
It said the system was fully consistent with humanitarian principles and would feed a million Palestinians - just under half the population - by the end of the week.
John Acree, a former senior manager at USAID - the US government agency responsible for administering foreign aid - has been named interim executive director.
Hamas has warned Palestinians not to co-operate with GHF's system, saying it would ""replace order with chaos, enforce a policy of engineered starvation of Palestinian civilians, and use food as a weapon during wartime"".
GHF's statement alleged that Hamas had also made ""death threats targeting aid groups supporting humanitarian operations at GHF's Safe Distribution Sites, and efforts to block the Gazan people from accessing aid at the sites"".
Israel's prime minister says its troops will ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza
Israel imposed a total blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
On 19 May, the Israeli military launched an expanded offensive that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would see troops ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. The plan reportedly includes completely clearing the north of civilians and forcibly displacing them to the south.
Netanyahu also said Israel would temporarily ease the blockade and allow a ""basic"" amount of food into Gaza to prevent a famine, following pressure from allies in the US.
Since then, Israeli authorities say they have allowed at least 665 lorry loads of humanitarian aid, including flour, baby food and medical supplies, into Gaza.
However, the head of the UN's World Food Programme warned on Sunday that the aid was only a ""drop in the bucket"" of what was needed in the territory to reverse the catastrophic levels of hunger, amid significant shortages of basic foods and skyrocketing prices.

Scientists in Spain say they have discovered the oldest full human fingerprint after unearthing a rock which they say resembles a human face and suggests Neanderthals could make art.
A Neanderthal man is believed to have dipped his finger in red pigment to paint a nose on a pebble around 43,000 years ago. The rock was discovered in the San LÃ¡zaro rock shelter in Segovia, Spain.
The ""strategic position"" of the dot has led scientists to see it as evidence of Neanderthals' ""symbolic behaviour"", suggesting they had the ability to think about things in an abstract way.
The findings contribute to the ongoing debate on Neanderthals' ability to make art, study co-author MarÃ­a de AndrÃ©s-Herrero said.
Sample zones in the red dot
In an interview with the BBC's Newsday, Prof de AndrÃ©s-Herrero from the University of Complutense in Madrid said excavation at the shelter began five years ago and in 2022 they found the stone below 1.5m (5 feet) of sediments from Neanderthal groups.
""At the beginning we couldn't believe what we were looking at, because there was a bigger stone in comparison to other stones that appeared at this site, with a red dot just in the middle which looked like a human face.""
It was unclear whether the dot was made with ochre, a natural clay pigment. Once the research group was able to confirm it was a pigment, Prof de AndrÃ©s-Herrero said they contacted Spain's scientific police to support their efforts.
This team was able to conduct deep research using multi-spectrum analysis and they identified a fingerprint.
Analysis of the pebble also suggested the fingerprint was of a male adult, according to the team's investigations.
But archaeologist David Ãlvarez Alonso, the study's co-author, said that as there were no other Neanderthal references to compare the prints to, it was difficult to say for certain. 
Speaking from a news conference updating the public on the scientific development, Spanish official Gonzalo Santonja said the pebble was the oldest portable object to be painted in the European continent and ""the only object of portable art painted by Neanderthals"".

Multi-spectrum analysis led to the identification of a fingerprint from the red dot
Prof de AndrÃ©s-Herrero said her research group's findings mark ""an important contribution to the debate on Neanderthals' symbolic capacity, because it represents the first known pigment-marked object in an archaeological context"" and it is ""clear it is a Neanderthal site"".
In addition to this, the human fingerprint was found in a non-utilitarian context, the expert added, suggesting that the dot on the pebble was intended for artistic purposes.
Prof Herrero also said it is the first time scientists have discovered a stone in an archaeological context with a red ochre dot, meaning Neanderthals brought it to the shelter.
The thinking is that one of the Neanderthals found the stone, ""which caught his attention because of its fissures, and he intentionally made his mark with an ochre [pigment] stain in the middle of the object,"" Prof Alonso said, quoted by Spanish news agency Europa Press.
Researchers believe the mark was not accidental because, according to their findings, the red pigment does not exist naturally in the shelter, meaning it was ""intentionally brought to the shelter"". 
In their paper, which was published in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, external, researchers wrote: ""The pebble from San LÃ¡zaro rock-shelter presents a series of characteristics that render it exceptional, based on which we have deemed it a visual symbol that could be considered a piece of portable art in some contexts."""

In a world first, wildlife researchers have snapped and published a photo of one of the most endangered African animals - a rare and relatively unknown antelope called the Upemba Lechwe.
Researchers carried out an aerial survey in the Kamalondo Depression, an area in southern Democratic Republic of Congo, which spotted just 10 of the antelopes - indicating their population is below 100.
Recounting how the photo came about, Manuel Weber, who led the survey and subsequent research, external, told the BBC it was ""extremely nerve-wracking"", but that he was ""relieved"" to get the image.
The Upemba Lechwe are known for the lack of dark stripes on their legs unlike other antelopes in the area, researchers say, external. 
They are also distinct due to the absence of dark patches on their shoulders.
The area the Upemba Lechwe were found is ""a magical place in terms of biodiversity"", Mr Weber said.
He however warned that it is an ""incredibly challenging"" setting with regards to conservation.
He said several issues including increasing human population, fishing and hunting put the areas ecology ""at risk"".
In a press statement published on the Upemba National Park website, external, Mr Weber, described the species as ""on the very brink"".
The fact the Upemba Lechwe was ""still hanging on at all is extraordinary"", Mr Weber added, but warned that they would ""vanish"" without ""urgent protection"".
""This may be our only chance to save this species.""
According to the study, published in the African Journal of Ecology, this was the first attempt to survey the species in more than 50 years.
The photo was captured on the second and final day of the aerial survey, and taken through the windows of a Cessna aircraft, Mr Weber told the BBC.
""It stood still for just a couple of seconds before running.""
DR Congo has a history of famous wildlife pictures. 
In 2019 a picture went viral taken at the Virunga National Park when two gorillas posed for a photo with their ranger.

""I have committed a grave crime, I am prepared to accept the verdict,"" Issa al H said in a statement read out by his defence lawyers at the start of his trial in the western city of DÃ¼sseldorf.
Issa al H, whose surname was not made public because of German privacy rules, is accused of being a member of the Islamic State jihadist group, and pledging allegiance to IS in videos shortly before the attack.
The stabbings took place as Solingen was holding a three-day festival to mark its 650th anniversary and came shortly before a series of key regional elections.
In the space of a year, German cities saw a string of deadly attacks, which began in Mannheim in May 2024, when an Afghan national stabbed a police officer at a rally.
Most of the attackers were described as having migrant backgrounds and the killings played a significant part in the national debate leading up to Germany's federal elections in February. 
While most mainstream parties toughened their language on migration, the far-right AfD were seen as benefiting most from the heightened climate, coming second with almost 21% of the vote. They have since narrowed the gap with Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives even further.
The man accused of the 23 August Solingen knife attack had arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2022, but because he had already registered for asylum in Bulgaria he was ordered to be deported there.
By the time German authorities tried to deport him in 2023 he had disappeared.
On Tuesday, Issa al H appeared in a high-security wing of the court in DÃ¼sseldorf wearing a blue T-shirt, and kept his head bowed for most of the time he stood in the dock.
He is accused of three murders as well as 10 counts of attempted murder and further charges of grievous bodily harm.
Prosecutors allege he approached IS contacts on jihadist social media forums before the attack and he was then given help planning it and choosing his murder weapon.
In his statement read out by his lawyers, Issa al H said: ""I killed innocents, not infidels.""
One of the people wounded in the Solingen attack sat in court on Tuesday, her arm in a sling, in a reminder of the wounds he inflicted in the city.
Athanasios Antonakis, a lawyer acting on behalf of a mother and daughter who were wounded in the attack, told public broadcaster WDR that ""my clients are expecting this trial will help improve the healing process""."

Party leaders lost their own seats, the New Democratic Party (NDP) now faces the possibility of life on the sidelines and the Liberal Party pulled off a dramatic turnaround in fortunes, all while led by a prime minister who wasn't even a member of Parliament (MP).
Validated results from Elections Canada show that 17% of seats - 59 out of 343 - changed hands in this election, up from just 7% - 22 out of 338 - in 2021.
The rise in the number of available seats in the House of Commons, from 338 to 343, reflects a new political map which accounts for changes in population.
Leaders from three of the five parties represented in the House of Commons failed to win their seats.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre - who was on course to become prime minister three months ago when his party held a double-digit lead in the polls - lost his seat in Carleton, Ontario to the Liberals.
Jagmeet Singh resigned as NDP leader after finishing third in his British Columbia seat of Burnaby Central, while the Green Party's co-leader Jonathan Pedneault came fifth in Outremont, Quebec.
Only Yves-FranÃ§ois Blanchet of the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois and Elizabeth May, the other Green co-leader, retained their seats while Mark Carney became an MP for the first time.
All 59 seats that flipped went to either the Liberals or Conservatives.
The NDP lost 17 of the 24 seats they were defending - 10 to the Conservatives and seven to the Liberals - and fell short of the 12 seats required for official party status.
This means the loss of parliamentary funding for things like office budgets and technology equipment, as well as fewer chances to ask questions of the government and sit on committees.
NDP losses were part of a wider shift away from Canada's smaller parties.
The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois had 35 seats going into the election, taking into consideration the impact of boundary changes on 2021 results - calculated by Elections Canada, external - and last year's victory in the LaSalle-Ãmard-Verdun by-election.
It lost 13 of them, with all but one going to the Liberals.
Terrebonne, a suburb of Montreal, had to go to a judicial recount which found that it had been won by the Liberals by just one vote.
Meanwhile, the Greens lost their Kitchener Centre riding, the first Ontario seat in their history, to the Conservatives. 
Despite making overall gains it was still a turbulent night for incumbents in the two largest parties.
The Liberals gave up 16 seats - all to the Conservatives - which was twice as many as the eight they lost in 2021.
Eight of the 16 losses came in Toronto and the surrounding ""905"" - places that all share the same area code.
Preliminary results suggested the Conservatives had taken another, Milton East-Halton Hills South by 298 votes. However, Elections Canada's vote validation process found it had stayed Liberal by just 29 votes. The result then went to a judicial recount which certified a Liberal hold by 21 votes.
The Conservatives saw 12 of their MPs suffer defeat including Poilievre, up from nine four years ago.
All 12 were won by Liberals, including Toronto St Paul's which the Conservatives previously flipped in a 2024 by-election.
Correction 11 May: This article was amended to say that the Conservatives won the Kitchener Centre riding, not the Liberals as we previously reported.

US President Donald Trump has issued a pardon to a former Virginia sheriff who was convicted on fraud and bribery charges. 
A jury found former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins guilty of accepting more than $75,000 (Â£55,000) in bribes last December, in exchange for making several businessmen into law enforcement officers without them being trained.
Jenkins, a long-time supporter of Trump, was sentenced in March to 10 years in prison. He was set to report to jail on Tuesday, but due to Trump's pardon, he will not spend a single day behind bars.
""Sheriff Scott Jenkins, his wife Patricia, and their family have been dragged through HELL,"" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network.
Trump said Jenkins was the ""victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice"". The judge who presided over Jenkins's case, Robert Ballou, was appointed by former President Joe Biden, but it was a jury trial.
Trump called Jenkins a ""wonderful person"" who was persecuted by ""Radical Left monsters"" and ""left for dead"". 
Jenkins was found guilty of one count of conspiracy, four counts of honest services fraud and seven counts of bribery concerning programmes receiving federal funds.
Prosecutors said he accepted bribes from eight people, including two undercover FBI agents. These were in the form of cash and campaign contributions. Jenkins's position was an elected one. 
The men who bribed Jenkins paid for auxiliary deputy sheriff positions so they could avoid traffic tickets and carry concealed firearms without a permit, the prosecutors said.
Although auxiliary deputy sheriffs are volunteer positions, they can have law-enforcement powers equivalent to those of paid officers. 
Trump said Jenkins tried to offer evidence in his defence, but Judge Ballou ""refused to allow it, shut him down, and then went on a tirade"".
The acting US attorney for Virginia said at the time of Jenkins's sentencing that the ex-sheriff violated his oath of office. He said the case proved that officials who used their positions for ""unjust personal enrichment"" would be held accountable.
But Jenkins appealed to Trump for help after his conviction. 
""I believe if he heard the information, I know he would help if he knew my story,"" he reportedly said in April on a webinar hosted by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association.
Jenkins was elected sheriff of Culpeper County in 2011 and took office in January 2012. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2019. 
The former policeman is the latest in a long line of Trump supporters to receive a pardon. 
In January, the president issued almost 1,600 pardons or commutations to people charged over the 2021 US Capitol riots. 
The US Constitution says that a president has the ""power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment"".
A pardon represents legal forgiveness, ends any further punishment and restores rights such as being able to vote or run for public office."

Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has signed into law a contentious bill that requires all motorists to buy a radio licence before acquiring vehicle insurance.
There has been an outcry from some motorists as they will now have to pay $92 (Â£68) annually in order to listen to the radio in their vehicles.
The introduction of the measure is part of a plan to widen revenue sources for the state broadcaster but critics say the licence fee is too high, especially given the difficult economic situation. 
Leading opposition figure Nelson Chamisa said the new law was ""too draconian, anti-citizens and outrightly heartless""., external 
Responding to motorists' concerns on social media, Nick Mangwana, a senior official in the ministry of information, said the new law was ""necessary"" and ""fair"", external.
There are about 1.2 million registered cars in the country but only 800,000 of them pay insurance, according to local media. 
The loss-making Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) relies for income on the licence fee as well as government grants, it also generates some revenue through advertising.

But the broadcaster is struggling to make people pay for their TV and radio licences. 
Critics have been calling for the scrapping of the fee, accusing ZBC of biased coverage in favour of the governing Zanu-PF.
The opposition has complained of unfair coverage by the broadcaster, especially during elections. ZBC has denied the accusation.
Under the new Broadcasting Services Amendment Act, all motorists must now pay the radio licence fee before they can renew their vehicle insurance or obtain a licence from the Zimbabwe National Road Authority (Zinara).
The changes, which were recently approved by parliament, pegs the fee at $23 per quarter, amounting to $92 per year.
However, ZBC can grant exemptions to those who qualify, including tourists visiting the country.
But the new amendment aims to eliminate loopholes and boost compliance with the requirement to have a licence. 
It prohibits all motor insurance companies from selling their products to motorists who do not hold a valid ZBC radio licence, unless they have a ZBC exemption certificate or the vehicle being insured does not have a radio receiver.
But the law has drawn sharp criticism from motorists and opposition groups, terming it a burden on taxpayers.
""Citizens are being pauperized left, right and centre, why does the citizenry of this country deserve so uncaring & heartless a leadership?"" Chamisa posted on X.

A British man has been handed a 10-month prison sentence in Indonesia for drug offences.
Thomas Parker, 32 and from Workington in Cumbria, was found guilty of failing to report drug-related crimes to the police in Bali.
Parker was arrested after being found in possession of a package, which was addressed to him, and contained more than 1kg (2.3lbs) of MDMA, also known as ecstasy.
Prosecutors had called for Parker to be sentenced to one year's imprisonment but judges handed him a lighter sentence because they said he had shown admission, remorse and an acknowledgment of guilt for failing to report the incident.
The 10-month prison term will be reduced to reflect the time he has already spent in detention since his arrest in January.

A 19-year-old New Zealander has died of a ""serious head injury"" sustained in a social media-inspired game of tackle with friends, police said.
The young man, identified in local media as Ryan Satterthwaite, died in hospital on Monday after a game of ""run it straight"" in the city of Palmerston North.
The game has two players - one with a ball, the other the tackler - who try to knock the other one down.
""We would urge anyone thinking about taking part in a game or event like this to consider the significant safety and injury risks,"" police spokesperson Ross Grantham said in a statement on Tuesday.
""While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity.""
He added that it was not a police matter, but officers would ""continue to undertake enquiries on behalf of the coroner"".
""Run it straight"" has long been played casually in Australia and New Zealand, but has recently taken off as a trend online and been endorsed by some professional rugby players, despite critics warnings it could give players head trauma and brain injury.
On social media, ""run it straight"" challenges show young men and students charging at each other as their friends watch on. In some videos, participants are seen passing out after being hit.
As the popularity of the game grew, some have started to hold their own tournaments - though it is unclear how these are regulated.
One such tournament, the Runit Championship League, made its debut in Auckland this month after first being held in Australia in March.
On its website, organisers described the game as the ""fiercest, new collision sport"".
The league drew more than 1,000 people to the Auckland's Trusts Arena as men went head-to-head for a prize of around $13,000 (Â£9,500).
Some participants were injured during their matches, and one video showed a man appearing to have a seizure after colliding with his rival.
But Runit Championship League organisers have promised to return to next month with an even bigger prize.
Kimami Ngaluafe, the organiser of Up the Guts NZ, another ""run it straight"" event in New Zealand, tells says the game has long been popular in the country, attracting five-year-old boys to men in their 40s.
""It's a Kiwi national backyard sport. The boys are currently playing as we speak,"" he tells the BBC.
But Satterthwaite's death is a reminder of how important safety is, Mr Ngaluafe says. He adds that players should wear protective headgear - which many currently do not - and have spotters around to prevent their heads from hitting the ground. 
""In New Zealand, kids are playing this kind of game every day. They deserve to be guided properly and shown how to do it the right way,"" he says."

The King is the head of state of Canada - and of 13 other Commonwealth realms such as Australia, New Zealand and several Caribbean states - as well as the UK. 
The King, who has travelled with Queen Camilla, previously journeyed to Canada several times as the Prince of Wales. This is his 20th visit.
Tuesday's address would traditionally be given by the governor general, who is the monarch's top representative in Canada. They read it on behalf of the prime minister, to set out the government's agenda when a new parliamentary session is about to begin.
Canada's House of Commons and Senate cannot conduct any public business before the Speech from the Throne is made.
It is so-called because it is typically read from the seat in the Senate chamber that is reserved for the monarch or their representative in Canada.
The current governor general is Mary Simon. But this time, newly elected Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited the King himself to inaugurate the new parliament.

What's changed in how Canada views the monarchy?
Elizabeth II delivered the address in 1977
While it is not unprecedented for the throne speech to be read by the monarch, the last time this happened was in October 1977, when Elizabeth II read the speech for the second time. The first was in 1957.
This is the first time a king has opened a new session of parliament. King Charles's grandfather George VI granted royal assent to several bills when he visited Canada in 1939, but he never delivered a throne speech.
Earlier in May, Prime Minister Mark Carney said he had invited the King to formally open Canada's 45th session of parliament. 
His request was viewed as a strategic one, as it came amid strained ties between Canada and its powerful neighbour the United States. 
US President Donald Trump has imposed tariffs on Canada, and has repeatedly referred to it as the ""51st state"". He also disparagingly referred to Carney's predecessor Justin Trudeau as ""Governor Trudeau"". 
Speaking in Ottawa, Carney said the King's visit ""clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country"". He told reporters: ""This is a historic honour that matches the weight of our times.""
Canada's Governor General Mary Simon said the visit ""highlights the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown"".
""Now more than ever, we need to come together to ensure a future that builds on our shared global values of democracy, equality and peace,"" she said. 
King Charles and Queen Camilla arrived at Ottawa's Macdonald-Cartier International Airport at 13:15 EST (17:15 GMT) on Monday, and were greeted by Governor General Mary Simon, Prime Minister Mark Carney and his wife, Diana Fox Carney. 
Assembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Natan Obed, and MÃ©tis National Council President Victoria Pruden were also at the airport.
The trip began at Lansdowne Park, where the royal couple met individuals and organisations showcasing Canadian identity and diversity.
They then made their way to Rideau Hall - the residence of Canada's governor general and the official residence of the monarch when in Canada. There, the King took part in a tree-planting ceremony.
He then held separate private meetings with Simon and Carney.
On Tuesday morning, the King and Queen headed to Canada's Senate accompanied by a royal escort, where they received full military honours - including a 100-person guard of honour from the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment, an inspection of the guard and the band, and a 21-gun salute.
Shortly after, the King delivered his Speech from the Throne to open the 45th session of parliament. 
The royal couple then paid their respects to Canada's fallen soldiers at the National War Memorial. 
They left the country around 13:00 local time (17:00 GMT).

A former MP from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Singh still faces charges of sexual harassment and stalking in a separate case by six adult female wrestlers.
Singh has always denied these charges.
The cases against Singh made headlines in 2023 when he was charged with sexual harassment after months of protests by India's top wrestlers.
The protests made headlines globally, especially after the police detained them as they tried to march to India's new parliament building in Delhi.
Footage of the Olympic medallists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and two-time world champion medallist Vinesh Phogat being dragged in the streets and carried off in police vans went viral, sparking criticism from top athletes and opposition politicians.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also condemned the way the wrestlers were being treated and called for an impartial inquiry into their complaints.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was criticised for not acting strongly or swiftly enough against Singh since he was a member of his party. The government had rejected the allegations.

The wrestlers agreed to pause their protests after meeting Home Minister Amit Shah and then Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.
Thakur assured them that charges would be filed against Singh by 15 June 2023.
Seven female wrestlers, including the minor, registered complaints with the police accusing Singh of molesting and groping them at training camps and tournaments. 
In the case of the minor, police had invoked the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.
Singh, denied all the allegations, accusing the wrestlers of being ""politically motivated"".
Weeks later, the minor retracted her earlier statements and withdrew her allegations, reports, external said. Wrestler Sakshi Malik told the BBC at the time that she believed ""the player was pressurised into withdrawing the charges"". Mr Singh refused to comment on the allegation, saying ""let law take its course"".

The prosecution lawyer said ""no corroborative evidence"" had been found in the allegations after a detailed investigation in the case.
Bar and Bench said the wrestler and her father had appeared before the court and expressed satisfaction with the police investigation. They also did not oppose the cancellation report.
In the aftermath of the row, Singh had stepped down as the wrestling federation chief. He was replaced by his close aide Sanjay Singh, who was later elected as the organisation's chief, leading to the accusation that Brij Bhushan Singh was still running it by proxy. The two Singhs denied the accusation but the federal sports ministry suspended the federation in December 2023.
In 2024, the federation resumed its functions after United World Wrestling, the international, organisation governing wrestling, lifted its ban on the Indian federation. Earlier this year, The Hindu and Indian Express newspapers reported that the Wrestling Federation of India was functioning, external out of Singh's address in Delhi.

North Korea has criticised the US's plan for a futuristic ""Golden Dome"" missile shield, saying it could ""turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field"".
The defence system, which President Donald Trump plans to unveil by the end of his term, is aimed at countering ""next-generation"" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.
Pyongyang's foreign ministry slammed the plan as ""the height of self-righteousness [and] arrogance"", state media reported.
It accused Washington of being ""hell-bent... to militarise outer space"" and warned that the plan might spark ""a global nuclear and space arms race"".
North Korea considers Washington an adversary and has routinely condemned joint military drills between the US and South Korea.
Pyongyang probably sees the Golden Dome as a threat that can ""significantly weaken"" its nuclear arsenal, Hong Min, a senior analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told AFP news agency. 
""If the US completes its new missile defence programme, the North will be forced to develop alternative means to counter or penetrate it,"" he said.
In 2022, the North passed a law declaring itself a nuclear weapons state, and it has tested a variety of ballistic and cruise missiles in recent years.
Early this year it claimed it fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead which it said ""will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region"".
North Korea joins China in criticising the US's plan. Beijing said last week that it is ""seriously concerned"" about the Golden Dome, which it said has ""strong offensive implications"".
""The United States, in pursuing a 'US-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,"" China's foreign ministry said. ""This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability.""
Many analysts believe an update to the US's limited defence systems is necessary, but some warn the process of developing the Golden Dome could face technical and political challenges.
For one, its hefty price tag could suck up a large chunk of the US defence budget. 
An initial sum of $25bn (Â£18.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it could end up costing 20 times that over decades."

Two bears are set to be rehomed at an animal sanctuary in the UK after being discovered ""emaciated"" and injured at a restaurant in Azerbaijan.
More than Â£225,000 has been raised by the Wildheart Animal Sanctuary, on the Isle of Wight, to build a ""world-leading"" facility which will be used to rehome Benji and Balu.
The two bears are thought to have been kept in inhumane conditions in a cage on the side of a restaurant, until their captivity was ruled to be illegal.
Having been saved by Azerbaijani charity, Good World Animal Rescue and Protection (GWARP), the bears are expected to be transported to the UK within the next month.
""Brothers Benji and Balu have lived a life of misery in a tiny cage on the side of a restaurant in Azerbaijan,"" the sanctuary said.
""Bored, hungry and suffering from serious injuries, these bears were kept there as nothing more than a novelty to attract customers.""
The bears had been used to attract tourists to a restaurant
They were discovered ""emaciated and in a very poor condition"", caged in the woods with 13 other bears by animal welfare charity GWARP, which has since been caring for them.
Having become aware of Benji and Balu in May 2024, Wildheart Animal Sanctuary fundraised hundreds of thousands of pounds to build a home for the bears.
The 3500 sq m (37,700 sq ft) facility can host up to four bears, with the brothers set to become its first residents next month.
They are set to arrive in the UK in June
""There are so many bears in need of rescue across Europe and a lack of facilities or space to house these bears who cannot be returned to the wild,"" the sanctuary's marketing director Lee Saudan said.
""We will provide them with bespoke care plans to ensure that they recover from the trauma they have experienced, with a forever home that will allow them to be bears again, with ponds and a stream, grass, trees, and places to hibernate, none of which they have every experienced before,"" he added.
Benji and Balu are expected to be flown on a flight sponsored by the airline Cargolux from Baku to their new home on the Isle of Wight in June.

Nepali sherpa Kami Rita, also known as ""Everest Man"", has scaled Mount Everest for the 31st time, breaking his own record for the most climbs up the world's tallest peak.
The 55-year-old, who was guiding a group of Indian army officials up the mountain, reached its 8,849m summit at 04:00 local time on Tuesday (23:15 GMT Monday).
""Kami Rita Sherpa needs no introduction. He is not just a national climbing hero, but a global symbol of Everest itself,"" expedition organiser Seven Summit Treks said in a statement.
Kami Rita first summited Everest in 1994 guiding a commercial expedition and has made the peak almost ever year since.
He scaled it twice some years, like in 2023 and 2024.
His closest competitor for the Everest record is fellow Nepali sherpa Pasang Dawa, who scaled the peak 29 times - the latest attempt made last week.
Kami Rita has previously told media how his climbs are just work.
""I am glad for the record, but records are eventually broken,"" he told AFP in May last year. ""I am more happy that my climbs help Nepal be recognised in the world.""
Earlier this month, Kami Rita posted snippets of life on Everest, including one of the Puja ceremony, a Tibetan Buddhist ritual done before Everest expeditions to pray for a safe and successful climb.
Kami Rita's feat comes one week after British mountaineer Kenton Cool summited Everest for the 19th time, also breaking his own record for the most climbs for a non-sherpa. 
More than 500 people and their guides have climbed Everest successfully this climbing season, which is coming to an end.
Nepal issued more than 1,000 climbing permits this season - including for Everest and other peaks - according to its tourism department. 
The number of Everest summit attempts has soared in recent years. However this has led to concerns around overcrowding and environmental impact. 
Last year, authorities introduced a rule requiring climbers to clear up their own poo and bring it back to base camp to be disposed of."

A Canadian man has been sentenced to almost two years in prison for stealing a famous photograph of Sir Winston Churchill known as ""The Roaring Lion"".
Jeffrey Wood had pleaded guilty to stealing the original print from Ottawa's ChÃ¢teau Laurier hotel between Christmas 2021 and early January 2022.  He also admitted committing forgery.
The photo of Britain's war-time prime minister, taken by Yousuf Karsh in 1941, features on the UK Â£5 note.
Ottawa Police said it was found last year in Genoa, Italy in the possession of a private buyer, who was unaware it was stolen.
The image depicts a frowning Churchill, who was 67 at the time, shortly after he delivered a speech to the Canadian parliament. 
It wasn't until August 2022 that a hotel staff member realised the original photo had been replaced with a fake.
According to Canadian media, Wood said he took the photo to find money for his brother, who was suffering from mental health problems. 
During sentencing, Justice Robert Wadden said: ""It is a point of national pride that a portrait taken by a Canadian photographer would have achieved such fame.""
""There is an element of trust in our society that allows such properties to be displayed, to be enjoyed by all Canadians. To steal, damage and traffic in such property is to breach that trust,"" he added.
""We're very happy to see that Canadian history is recognised,"" said GeneviÃ¨ve Dumas, the general manager of the ChÃ¢teau Laurier hotel, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, external.
Wood was sentenced to ""two years less a day"", a distinction which means he will serve his sentence in a provincial institution instead of a federal prison.
The lawyer representing Wood said the sentence was ""unnecessarily harsh"" given that he was a first-time offender."

The King and Queen Camilla received a warm welcome when they arrived in Ottawa, on the royal couple's first trip to Canada since the start of their reign.
Soon after arriving, the King, who is Canada's head of state, held a meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney, recently elected on a wave of anti-Trump public opinion.
Carney has praised the ""historic ties"" that make up Canada's independent identity, including the ""vitality of our constitutional monarchy"", which he said ""crises only fortify"".
Carney invited the King to deliver the speech at the opening of parliament after his recent general election victory, in a campaign dominated by the threats to Canada's sovereignty from Trump.
It will be the first time in almost 50 years that a monarch gives the Speech from the Throne, with the King's decision to come to parliament in Ottawa seen as a symbolic show of support for Canada.
The King's speech will be written on the advice of the Canadian government, with the expectation that it will send a clear, if diplomatic, message that the country is ""not for sale"" to the US.
Carney said in advance that the speech, to be delivered in French and English, would match ""the weight of our times"".
On Monday afternoon, the King and Carney held a meeting at Rideau Hall, the residence of Canada's governor-general, with both men sitting in front of Canadian flags.
There were also meetings with leaders of Canada's indigenous and First Nations groups, including Cindy Woodhouse, the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations.
In pictures: King Charles and Queen Camilla welcomed in Ottawa
Why is the King in Canada, and what is the throne speech?
What's changed in how Canada views the monarchy?

Looking relaxed in the Ottawa sunshine, the King took part in a tree-planting ceremony, receiving an enthusiastic reception from onlookers, who cheered and crowded round to shake hands with him.
""Canada feels threatened and scared. It is very important he is here,"" said Theresa McKnight, from Mississauga, Ontario.
Her sister Dianne St Louis, from near Toronto, agreed: ""It's critical. It means a great deal to have the King standing side by side with Canadians.""
There had been a warm welcome at Ottawa airport, for what will be a visit of about 24 hours on the ground in Canada.
Carney was on the runway to meet the royal visitors, with a welcoming party that included schoolchildren from English- and French-speaking schools and representatives of First Nations communities.
A community event had also been a checklist of Canadian moments, such as the King dropping a puck to start a game of street hockey and getting jars of maple syrup.
But the main focus of this trip will be the historic speech on Tuesday, with the prospect of the King delivering the Canadian government's message of rejecting calls to become the US 51st state.
It is also a diplomatic balancing act because in his role as head of state of the UK, the King has been part of an effort to keep good relations with Trump, including inviting him for a second state visit.
But in Canada, the King will have to speak on behalf of Canada. As another bystander said at Rideau Hall: ""Sovereignty is important and he is the epitome of that.""

A naval court in Greece has charged 17 coastguards over the deadliest migrant boat disaster in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade.
Up to 650 people were feared to have drowned when the overcrowded Adriana fishing vessel sank near Pylos, off the Greek coast, in the early hours of 14 June 2023.
Survivors later told the BBC that Greek coastguards had caused their boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then silenced witnesses. 
""It has taken us two years just for these charges to come, even though so many people witnessed what happened,"" one of the survivors said on Monday. 
The Greek authorities have always denied the claims against them.
The Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court has found that 17 members of the Hellenic Coast Guard should face criminal charges.
Among them is the captain of the coastguard ship, the LS-920, who is charged with ""causing a shipwreck"", leading to the deaths of ""at least 82 people"".
This corresponds to the number of bodies recovered, although it is thought as many as an additional 500 people drowned, including women and children who were all below deck.
The disaster occurred in international waters but within Greece's rescue zone.
The then-Chief of the Coast Guard and the Supervisor of the National Search and Rescue Coordination Centre in Piraeus are among four officials charged with ""exposing others to danger"". 
The captain of the LS-920 is also charged with ""dangerous interference of maritime transport"" as well as a ""failure to provide assistance"" to the migrant boat.
The crew of the ship are charged for ""simple complicity"" in all the acts allegedly committed by the captain.
A coastguard ship had been monitoring the Adriana for 15 hours before it sank.
It had left Libya for Italy with an estimated 750 people on board. Only 104 of them are known to have survived.
We have been investigating since the day of the disaster and our series of findings has cast serious doubt on the official Greek version of events.
Within a week, we obtained shipping data which challenged the claim the migrant boat had not been in trouble and so did not need to be rescued. 
A month later, survivors told us the coastguard had caused their boat to sink in a disastrous effort to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent. 
Last year, a case against nine Egyptians was thrown out, amid claims they had been scapegoated by the Greek authorities. 
Earlier this year, audio recordings emerged which further challenged the official Greek version of events. 
We first met Syrian refugees, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identities, a month after the disaster.
They said they each paid $4,500 (Â£3,480) for a spot on the boat.
The younger brother of Ahmad - a Syrian now living in Germany - was also on board and did not survive.
Musaab described to us the moment when - he alleged - the Greek coastguards caused their boat to sink.
""They attached a rope from the left,"" he said. ""Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it. The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance.""
The men claimed that once on land, in the port of Kalamata, the coastguard told survivors to ""shut up"" when they started to talk about how the Greek authorities had caused the disaster.
""When people replied by saying the Greek coastguard was the cause, the official in charge of the questioning asked the interpreter to tell the interviewee to stop talking,"" Ahmad said.
He said officials shouted: ""You have survived death. Stop talking about the incident Don't ask more questions about it.""
On Monday, Ahmad said he felt vindicated by the charges that had been brought. 
""I'm very happy they are eventually being held accountable for all that they have committed, but until I see them in prison nothing has been done yet,"" he said. 
""To be honest, the Greek legal system is very unreliable.""  
The joint legal team representing survivors and victims of the disaster said the decision to pursue a case against the 17 coastguards was a big step forward towards justice being done.
In a statement it said: ""Almost two years after the Pylos shipwreck, the prosecution and referral to main investigation for felonies of 17 members of the Coast Guard, including senior officers of its leadership, constitutes a substantial and self-evident development in the course of vindication of the victims and the delivery of justice.""
It is understood the 17 men who have now been charged will be questioned in the coming weeks by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court.
The court will then decide whether to send them to full trial or dismiss the charges.
It is not immediately clear what punishment the coastguards could receive if found guilty.
Greece has previously told the BBC its Coast Guard fully respects human rights and has rescued more than 250,000 people at sea in the past decade."

For Mansukh Prajapati, childhood in the western Indian city of Morbi began before sunrise, with a six-mile walk to collect clay for their family business.
""My father was a potter,"" he recalls.
Often he would wake up to the rhythmic sound of his father at work at his potter's wheel.
""My mother and I would get up at four in the morning and walk for miles every day to get clay.""
Used for storing water, clay pots were a common item in Indian households in the 1970s.
But the income from making pots was meagre and the profession also came with social stigma.
""Nobody wanted to their daughter married in a potter's family,"" Mr Prajapati says. ""They feared she will be burdened with endless labour.""
Aged 31, a natural disaster marked the turning point for Mr Prajapati. 
The devastating earthquake that hit Gujarat in 2001 destroyed his family home and left a pile of smashed clay pots in the courtyard.
""A local reporter wrote that 'the poor people's fridge is broken',"" Mr Prajapati says.
""Clay pots keep water cool in the summer, so they are just like a fridge. The thought got stuck in my head. So, I decided to make a fridge out of clay that doesn't need electricity.""
With no formal training, Mr Prajapati started experimenting with designs and materials.
""I first tried to make it like the modern fridge and even added a water tank, but nothing worked', he says.
""At one point I had $22,000 (Â£17,000) in loans and had to sell my house and small workshop. But I knew I had to keep going.""
It took four years of tinkering to come up with a design that worked - a small clay cabinet with a water talk on the top and storage shelves below.
As water trickles through the cabinet's porous clay walls, it naturally cools the interior.
Mr Prajapati says it can keep fruit and vegetables fresh for at least five days - no electricity needed. 
He named it MittiCool or the clay that stays cool.
At $95 its affordable and now sold through 300 stores in India and exported to countries including the UK, Kenya, and UAE.
""Fridges are a dream for many poor families,"" Mr Prajapati says. ""And such dreams should be within reach.""
The affordable MittiCool fridge is made from clay
Mr Prajapati's innovation is part of a growing wave of grassroots entrepreneurship in India, driven by necessity.
Prof Anil Gupta who runs the Honeybee Network, a platform for supporting such ventures, call these ""frugal innovations"".
""It is a mindset,"" says Prof Gupta.
""Frugal innovation is about making solutions affordable, accessible, and available. Many of these innovators don't have formal education but are solving real world problems.""
It's difficult to put a number on such businesses, as there has never been an in-depth study.
Prof Gupta says such start-ups are crucial because they provide jobs in rural areas and start a cycle of economic change.
For example, Mr Prajapati now employs 150 people in his workshop and has branched out into cookware, clay water filters and is experimenting with homes made of clay.
Botanist turned entrepreneur Bijayshanti Tongbram shows the fibres in lotus stems
Another start-up that's hoping for similar success, is run by Bijayshanti Tongbram in the northeastern state of Manipur.
She lives in Thanga village which is home to one of India's largest freshwater lakes, Loktak.
Here lotus flowers bloom in abundance.
""People in my village use the petals of lotus flowers for religious offerings. But their stems often go to waste and that's what I wanted to change and thought of doing something sustainable,"" she says.
A botanist by profession, Ms Tongbram developed a way to extract silk-like fibres from the lotus stems and now leads a team of 30 women in her village who spin the threads into a yarn and weaves them into unique scarves and garments.
""It takes two months, and 9,000 lotus stems to make one scarf,"" she says.
Ms Tongbram pays the women $80 a month.
""This isn't just about fashion. I am giving women in my village a chance to do something other than fishing and earn money,"" she says.
Like many small business owners, she wants to scale-up and find new markets, perhaps overseas.
""Funding is the biggest challenge,"" she says.
Fibres can be extracted from lotus stems to make a yarn
Prof Gupta from the Honeybee network agrees.
""There are government schemes and small grants, but rural entrepreneurs often don't  know how to access them.
""Even venture capitalists who are looking at IT innovations rarely invest in these kinds of start-ups because of high transaction costs,"" he says.
Nevertheless, innovators continue to spring up.
In Karanataka's Vijaynagar, Girish Badragond is working on a device to help blind and partially-sighted farmers.
His device, described as a smart farming stick, uses soil sensors and weather data to guide its users about the crop conditions and harvests through audio messages and vibrations.
""There are so many blind people in India who want to farm but they can't trust others to guide them. This will help them become independent and empower them,"" says Mr Badragond.
He has sourced mechanical parts from different shops and is hoping to gain support for commercialising his project soon. For now, he is doing rounds of government exhibitions.
""It's a prototype but I am hopeful that people will support me to change lives of others,"" he says."

Today, there are concerns that this is being ignored.
While the constitution requires regional representation in cabinet positions, the broader distribution of other prominent roles has traditionally followed a convention aimed at fostering national cohesion. 
Nigeria's fractious divisions have in the past torn the country - Africa's most populous - apart.
Worries about fairness in presidential appointments are not new, but a chorus of criticism is growing over President Bola Tinubu's picks, with some accusing the head of state - who has been in power for two years -Â of favouring people from his own Yoruba ethnic group.
The presidency vehemently denies the accusation.
There have long been fears that members of one ethnic group would come to dominate key positions â and this means that presidential appointments are closely scrutinised whenever they are announced.
There are more than 250 ethnic groups in the country with Hausa-Fulanis, Igbo and Yoruba - hailing from the north, south-east and south-west respectively - being the three largest.
Critics say that Tinubu, a southern Muslim, showed signs of ignoring precedent from the onset when he picked another Muslim (although from the north) to be his running mate for the last election. 
Since the return of democracy in 1999, the major parties had always put forward a mixed Muslim-Christian ticket, as the country is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.
It is now Tinubu's appointments since becoming president in May 2023 that people are focusing on.
The rich traditions of Nigeria's many ethnic groups are often celebrated, but tensions between those groups have threatened the unity of the nation
Although there are dozens of roles for a head of state to fill, there are eight jobs that ""are the most crucial for every administration"", according to political analyst and barrister Lawal Lawal. 
These are the heads of the: 
central bank
state-owned oil company, NNPC
police
army
customs service
intelligence agency
anti-corruption agency and
revenue service.
There is no constitutional ranking of positions, but collectively these roles control the key financial and security apparatus of the country. 
Every president inherits his predecessor's appointees, but has the prerogative to replace them.
As of April, all eight positions under Tinubu are now filled by Yorubas.
The recent appointment of former Shell boss Bayo Ojulari to head the state-owned oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), in place of a northerner turbocharged the debate about the apparent monopoly of one group in top positions.
Looking at who filled the same posts under Tinubu's two immediate predecessors, there was no such dominance of one ethnic group at the same stage of their presidencies.
Goodluck Jonathan - who served from 2010 to 2015 - had a relatively balanced team of two ethnic Fulanis, two Hausas, one Atyap, one Igbo, one Yoruba and one Calabar.
When it came to Muhammadu Buhari - in power from 2015 to 2023 - the situation was less clear.
In the top eight he had three Hausas, two Kanuris, one Igbo, one Yoruba and one Nupe.  
But in the minds of many Nigerians, Hausas, Kanuris and Nupes are all seen as northerners - and therefore there was a perception that Buhari, who is from the north, showed favouritism. 
Some argue that Tinubu's appointments have merely continued the trend, but the 100%-Yoruba make-up of the eight key positions is unprecedented.
""For a democratically elected president, I cannot remember at any point in Nigerian history where you have this high concentration of a particular ethnic group holding most of the sensitive positions,"" history professor Tijjani Naniya told the BBC.
This is not just about what has happened in the past but it could have an impact on the unity and even the future of the country, the professor said. 
""For me, the fear is what if the next president continues on this path and picks most of the sensitive positions from his ethnic group, it diminishes the feeling of belonging among the rest and also reduces belief in democracy,"" he said.
In the last two years, many northerners, mostly Hausa-Fulanis, have looked at the apparent direction of travel with alarm.
The current men (there are no women) in charge of the NNPC, the police, customs and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) all replaced northerners.
The removal of Abdulrasheed Bawa, a Hausa, as boss of the EFCC in 2023 just two years after he was appointed was especially controversial. 
He was arrested, accused of abuse of office and detained for more than 100 days before the charges were dropped. 
He was replaced by Ola Olukoyode, an ethnic Yoruba.
Some from the north felt Mr Bawa was unfairly treated and pushed aside to make way for Mr Olukoyode.
""The president needs to know that the Yoruba people are just a part of the country, and all appointments should be spread across all ethnic groups and regions,"" social affairs analyst Isah Habibu told the BBC.
Without addressing specific cases, a Tinubu spokesperson has said the president is being fair and balanced, by taking the wider view of all appointments.
Some Nigerians are concerned that President Tinubu's Yoruba ethnic group is dominating the government
Media aide Sunday Dare did try to go into detail, saying overall, 71 northerners and 63 southerners had been appointed by Tinubu. But his 9 April post on X was later deleted, after people pointed out errors in his claim.
He promised an updated list, but more than six weeks later, it has yet to appear. 
Tinubu faces critics even from within his own party.
Senator Ali Ndume is from the north and - like Tinubu - belongs to the All Progressives Congress. In one television interview he said he had gone on air to talk about the president's appointment ""wrongdoings"".
Ndume said he was shocked, describing them as ""non-inclusive and not reflecting the president's 'Renewed Hope' agenda, which promised to carry every section of the country along"".
Another presidential aide, Daniel Bwala, disputed the idea that some positions were more significant than others.
""All I know is that the constitutional provisions [regarding appointments] have been taken care of by the president - there's nowhere in the constitution [where it is] mentioned top five, top 10 and the rest,"" he told the BBC.
""The way we see it is that any position or appointment that one is privileged to serve in is very critical and important.
""The national security adviser is from the north-east, the chief of defence staff is from the north-west and the secretary to the federal government is from north-central.""
The Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, which co-ordinates policy on behalf of the presidency, released a statement on 12 April saying Tinubu was being fair.
""This administration is dedicated to ensuring that all regions and demographics of the country are adequately represented in its institutions and agencies,"" it said.
Political analyst Mr Lawal said the president should appoint the best person for the job, irrespective of their ethnic origin - and argues that this is what Tinubu is doing.
""It's high time Nigeria looks beyond ethnicity,"" he said.
There could be a time when Nigerians no longer obsess over the ethnic origins of those in the upper echelons of government, but historian Prof Naniya says this is still some way off.
He believes it can only happen when the country gets at least four presidents in succession who give every section a sense of belonging in terms of projects and appointments.
""I think it can be done but needs the right leaders.""

Nearly three weeks after Rohit Sharma's sudden retirement from Test cricket, the Indian cricket board has ended speculation of his successor by naming Shubman Gill as India's new captain for the upcoming five-Test series against England in June.
At 25, Gill becomes India's 37th Test captain - and one of its youngest, after Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri.
His appointment marks a turning point for Indian cricket. The squad he leads is without batting greats Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, spin stalwart R Ashwin who retired six months ago, and pace spearhead Mohammed Shami, who was sidelined due to fitness concerns.
The team is rich in young batting talent but will miss the experience of Kohli and Sharma. Despite Jaspreet Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, and Mohammad Siraj, the bowling attack still feels a touch raw. 
Adding to Gill's challenge: India haven't won a Test series in England since 2007.
His appointment followed intense deliberations between chief selector Ajit Agarkar, coach Gautam Gambhir, and backchannel talks with other contenders.
Though Bumrah seemed the natural choice after serving as vice-captain in Australia, concerns over his ability to shoulder the workload of a five-Test series tipped the scales in Gill's favour.
Consistent run-getting as a junior, fast-tracked Gill (right) into the under-19 ranks 
A prodigy from Punjab state, Gill has long carried the weight of expectation with elegance.
He burst into the spotlight in 2014, not yet 15, hammering 351 in a world-record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh in the Punjab Inter-District ML Markan Trophy. It was a knock that vindicated his family's bold move from the border village of Chak Kherewala to Mohali, seeking better training and greater exposure for the young talent.
Consistent run-getting as a junior, fast-tracked him into the under-19 ranks which is where Gill really made his first big impact.
Vice-captain of the team that played the 2017-18 U-19 World Cup, he emerged as the top run aggregator for India, highlighted by a skilful, unbeaten 102 against arch rivals Pakistan in the semi-final. In the final where India beat Australia, Gill scored a handy 31.
At the time, all eyes were on Prithvi Shaw - the U-19 captain whose Mumbai schoolboy feats drew comparisons with Tendulkar. His rise was meteoric: a Test debut century, another soon after. But by 2020, his career had begun to unravel.
Temporarily sidelined, Gill made an immediate impact on his Ranji Trophy debut with a half-century, followed by a century. Under Yuvraj Singh's mentorship, he sharpened both his batting and game awareness.
Prolific runs pushed selectors to consider Gill as Shaw's replacement. He debuted in Tests in Melbourne, December 2020, during India's memorable comeback series win.
Tall and graceful, Gill's technical precision and elegant stroke play - especially front of the wicket - set him apart as a promising young talent. Nicknamed the 'Prince' by his family, the title soon became his cricketing identity. Hailed as the Next Big Thing, he's widely tipped to succeed Virat Kohli as the next generation's leading batsman.
That promise remains unproven. Like Kohli, Gill is an all-format player, but unlike Kohli's early dominance, Gill has yet to display the same ambition and match-winning impact - especially in Tests, where his 1,893 runs in 32 matches are solid but not outstanding.

Gill (right) is captaining the IPL side Gujarat Titans in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL)
Gill's first captaincy, less than five years after his Test debut, comes at a crucial point in his career.
With enough international experience to elevate his batting from good to great, he now faces a stern test against England's Bazball style of play in challenging conditions. Success here would be a major boost to his standing as a top Test player.
But it is as captain that Gill probably faces tougher challenges.
The England series kicked off India's new World Test Championship cycle, following two finals appearances but a disappointing early exit in the last one. India's recent Test form has been poor, with back-to-back series losses to New Zealand and Australia.
To pull India out of the current rut, Gill will have to lead the way as batter as well as captain in charge of a new-look team, whose dressing-room and dynamics he will have to understand and, perhaps, reshape.
""Gill is a young man we are investing in not just for one series, but for the next five-six years to take Indian cricket ahead,'' said chief selector Ajit Agarkar.
That should be a tremendous reassurance for the new captain. While his appointment brings its share of pressure, it also carries immense hope - and an opportunity to carve his own legacy in Indian cricket history."

South Korea will elect a new president on 3 June to replace Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office for placing the country under martial law for six hours in December.
The winner will be tasked with managing the political and economic fallout of Yoon's move, which plunged the country in deep turmoil and divided opinions.
The snap election is also being held as South Korea faces an unpredictable ally in US President Donald Trump - and that will shape long-running challenges such as the threat from North Korea, and Seoul's frosty relationship with China. 
Here is what you need to know as the nation of about 52 million people chooses a new president who will lead it for the next five years.
Yoon was supposed to serve as president until 2027, but his term ended in disgrace.
He shocked the nation by declaring martial law on 3 December, citing threats from ""anti-state forces"" and North Korea - but it soon became clear that he was spurred by his own political troubles.
A week later, he was impeached by parliament. On 4 April, a constitutional court upheld his impeachment and removed him from office permanently, setting the stage for a snap presidential election within 60 days, as required by law.
In the six turbulent months since Yoon's martial law attempt, the country has had three acting presidents, the most recent being Lee Ju-ho, the education minister who assumed the role one month before the election.
Lee replaced Prime Minister Han Duck Soo, who himself was impeached just weeks after taking over from Yoon as acting president. Finance minister Choi Sang-mok was acting president before Han was reinstated in March.
Yoon's martial law laid bare the deep political divisions in the country, as those who supported his decision to impose martial law and those who opposed it took to the streets in protest.  
Yoon's martial law declaration immediately triggered protests calling for his ouster   
The following months of uncertainty shook public confidence in South Korea's economy. And this was at a time when US President Donald Trump unleashed his tariffs on America's trading partners, with South Korean goods facing a 25% levy.
Closer to home, relations with North Korea are a persistent challenge. While 2025 has been relatively uneventful, the year before saw heightened tensions as Kim Jong Un escalated the rhetoric, and both sides spent months sending balloons and drones carrying propaganda materials across the border. 
South Korea's new leader must also balance Seoul's relations between its biggest trading partner, Beijing, and its most important security ally, Washington.
Then there is the task of arresting the country's declining birth rate, which is among the lowest in the world - 0.75. 
Polls have placed Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party as the frontrunner among six candidates, followed by Kim Moon-soo from the ruling PPP.
Lee, who lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin in 2022, is hailed by his supporters as a working class hero. He worked in a factory before he became a human rights lawyer and politician. He has promised to establish a ""real Republic of Korea"" with jobs and a fair society.
Kim, a former labour minister, has positioned himself as a president for the economy, promising to create a business-friendly environment.
The other candidates are Lee Jun-seok of the New Reform Party, Kwon Young-guk of the Democratic Labor Party and two independents - Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin- ho.
For the first time in 18 years, there is no woman running for president. The first woman to run for president was Hong Suk-Ja in 1987, but she withdrew before the vote. The election in 2012 saw four female candidates contest for the top job. 
The election is scheduled on 3 June and voting precincts will be open from 06:00 local time (22:00 GMT) to 20:00. South Koreans overseas were allowed to vote early from 20 to 25 May.
Results are expected to come in after polls close and the winner will likely be known  in the early hours of the following day.
When Yoon defeated Lee in 2022, he was proclaimed the winner nine hours after the close of voting, or at 04:40 the morning after election day.
Former president Yoon Suk Yeol celebrates after winning the election in 2022
That was the closest presidential contest in the country's history, which saw Yoon win by a 0.73% difference in votes.
The new president will take office immediately and unlike many of his predecessors, will not have the advantage of a formal transition from Yoon.
Yoon faces trial for an insurrection charge as a result of his attempt to impose martial law.  
In January this year he became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody. He was released from detention weeks later on a technicality.
He was also recently indicted for abuse of power, a separate charge to insurrection.
Before the election, Yoon quit his party in what analysts said was an attempt to shore up the chances of PPP's presidential candidate Kim Moon-soo."

The two-day visit began on Monday with a whirlwind of pomp and pageantry that included a welcome ceremony for the King and Queen at the airport, a street hockey puck drop and a ceremonial tree planting. 
It comes ahead of a big day on Tuesday, when the King will deliver the Speech of the Throne - which will lay out the government's priorities and goals - to parliament.
A monarch has not delivered the throne speech in Canada since 1977, making this royal visit a rare occasion.
""The Royal Visit is a reminder of the bond between Canada and the Crown â one forged over generations, shaped by shared histories, and grounded in common values,"" said Prime Minister Mark Carney in a statement on Monday.
Here is a look at King Charles III and Queen Camilla's time in Ottawa so far.
An arrival guard from the Royal Canadian Dragoons, a senior armoured regiment of the Canadian Armed Forces, participated in the ceremony
The King and Queen touched down in Ottawa at around 13:15 local time (18:15 BST). They were welcomed by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Armed Forces. 
Waiting for them on the runway were Prime Minister Carney, his wife Diana Fox Carney, Canada's Governor General Mary Simon and other dignitaries.
They were also met by national indigenous leaders.
The King wore a dark red, patterned tie, while the Queen donned a light pink ensemble from a British designer. 
She wore a diamond maple leaf brooch that was given by King George VI to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, in 1939 ahead of their first royal tour to Canada. 
That same brooch was passed down to Queen Elizabeth II, and has been loaned to other royals including Catherine, Princess of Wales.

Carney extended an invitation to the King earlier this year and announced the visit shortly after his Liberal party won Canada's general election in April. 
The visit comes amid a trade war with the country's neighbour and close economic ally, the United States.  
US President Donald Trump has also repeatedly said the country would be better off as a 51st US state.
At the airport, the Queen was given a bouquet of flowers and she and the King  were greeted by school groups from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
Some of the children who attended the arrival are enrolled in the Duke of Edinburgh programme, a global youth development programme launched by the late Prince Phillip - the King's father - in 1956. 
Crowds gathered well before the arrival of the King and Queen at Ottawa's Lansdowne Park 
After the airport greeting, the King and Queen travelled to Lansdowne Park in central Ottawa, where they met well-wishers, local community groups, farmers, and vendors.

The King and Queen later partook in a tree planting ceremony at Rideau Hall, the official residence of Canada's governor general. 
Commemorative tree planting at Rideau Hall is a tradition that began in 1906, and is meant to symbolise friendship and cooperation between nations. 
Monday's ceremony marks the fifth tree planted by the King in Canada, and the second with Queen Camilla by his side. 
They planted a Blue Beech, a small deciduous tree native to eastern North America and known for its bright autumn leaves. 
Afterwards, the King held privates audiences with Gov Gen Simon and Prime Minister Carney.

Crowds of far-right Israelis chanted insults and assaulted Palestinians during an annual parade for Jerusalem Day on Monday.
Chants of ""death to Arabs"" and nationalistic slogans were repeated during the event, which commemorates Israeli forces taking Palestinian-majority East Jerusalem during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Violence broke out as ultranationalist Jews streamed into Palestinian areas of Jerusalem's walled Old City.
Opposition Leader Yair Lapid said the event had become a festival of ""hatred and racism"", adding it was ""a disgrace and an insult to Judaism"".
Right-wing activists hold a banner saying ""67 - Jerusalem in our hands; 2025 - Gaza in our hands""
Israeli police were deployed as violence broke out in the walled Old City of Occupied East Jerusalem shortly after midday.
Thousands of nationalist Israelis descended to Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances. Right-wing activists held banners that read ""67 - Jerusalem in our hands; 2025 - Gaza in our hands"". 
Arab traders in the Muslim Quarter who had yet to close their shops were harassed by young Israeli men, witnesses said. 
Chants of ""May your village burn"" and ""Your home will be ours"" were heard throughout the march. 
Aggressive marchers were detained and removed from the Old City by Israeli police. 
National security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, of the Jewish Power party, called for the death penalty for ""terrorists"" in an address to the crowds.
Gvir also visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam and known by Jews as the Temple Mount. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and it is the holiest site in Judaism.
The compound is administered by a Jordanian Islamic trust. Jews are allowed to visit but not pray there.
A spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, based in the West Bank, condemned the march and Ben Gvir's visit to Al-Aqsa.
Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, ""repeated incursions into the Al-Aqsa mosque compound and provocative acts such as raising the Israeli flag in occupied Jerusalem threaten the stability of the entire region,"" Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a statement.
In a cabinet meeting on Monday morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep Jerusalem ""united, whole, and under Israeli sovereignty"".

Left-wing opposition leader Yair Golan described images of violence in the Old City as ""shocking"".
""This is what hatred, racism and bullying look like,"" he said in a statement on X. 
""We will fight for Jerusalem for all of us, Jews, Christians and Muslims, secular and religious.
""Jerusalem belongs to all those who love her. We will fight for her and restore her as a city for us all.""
Lapid, another opposition leader, added: ""There is nothing Jewish about this violence. The government ministers who remain silent in the face of these events are complicit in this disgrace.""
Every year thousands of Israelis march a route through Jerusalem and the annexed Old City, ending at the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are allowed to pray in Jerusalem. On Sunday, a large Israeli flag was unfurled at the Western Wall plaza.
The parade marks Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and the ""unification"" of a city that the Israeli government says is their eternal capital.
Palestinians also want Jerusalem as their future capital and much of the international community regards East Jerusalem as Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory.
This year's Flag March again coincided with the war in Gaza and escalating Israeli military operations against Palestinian militants in the West Bank. 
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Fifty-seven are still being held, about 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.
At least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

The US president said on Truth Social on Sunday that ""something has happened"" to Putin, after Russia killed 13 in Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles. ""He has gone absolutely crazy,"" Trump said. ""Needlessly killing a lot of people.""
Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the comments were ""connected to an emotional overload of everyone involved"".
Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, meanwhile said that Ukraine's allies had removed all range limits on supplied arms, amid reports he would give Kyiv Taurus missiles.
Trump's comments followed Russia's largest combined aerial attack since its full-scale invasion of February 2022. At least 13 people were killed and dozens injured in Ukraine during the night between Saturday and Sunday after Russia fired 367 drones and missiles.
Between Sunday evening and Monday morning, Russia launched 355 drones against Ukraine, killing 10. The Ukrainian air force said it was the largest attack yet conducted with drones alone.
Peskov said the latest aerial assaults were a response to Ukrainian attacks on Russia's ""social infrastructure"".
The Russian defence ministry said that air defence systems destroyed 20 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions.
Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, said on Sunday there was no ""military sense"" to Russia's aerial attacks - rather they were ""an obvious political choice... by Putin, a choice by Russia... to continue the war and destroy lives.""
In an apparent response to the Russian attacks over the weekend, German chancellor Merz said there were ""no longer"" range restrictions on arms supplied to Ukraine.
""This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... with very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that,"" Merz said.
Reuters reported that Zelensky was due to travel to Berlin on Wednesday, although this has not been confirmed.
The BBC approached the Chancellery for comment on whether Merz's statement suggested an announcement was imminent on the supply of Taurus missiles - something that the previous German government refused to do.
Last year, the UK said that Ukraine had the right to decide how to use British supplied weapons in its defence. In November, then-US president Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use long-range missiles supplied by the US to strike Russia, albeit with limitations.
The Taurus missile has a range of about 500km - a far greater distance than other systems supplied by Ukraine's allies. Russia said supply of the weapon would be ""a dangerous move"".

Speaking in New Jersey late on Sunday, Trump said of Putin: ""I've known him a long time, always gotten along with him, but he's sending rockets into cities and killing people, and I don't like it at all.""
He also said he was considering increasing US sanctions on Russia - something he has repeatedly threatened to do before.
Trump posted his ""crazy"" remark shortly afterwards, adding on Truth Social: ""I've always said that he wants all of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!""
But the US president also had strong words for Zelensky, saying that he was ""doing his country no favours by talking the way he does"".
""Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don't like it, and it better stop,"" Trump wrote of Zelensky.
Despite Kyiv's European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or ""walk away"" if progress does not follow.
Peskov said on Monday that Russia was ""truly grateful"" to the Americans and ""personally to President Trump"" for their help in organising and launching this negotiation process.
Last week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed ceasefire deal to halt the fighting.
The US president said he believed the call had gone ""very well"", adding that Russia and Ukraine would ""immediately start"" negotiations toward a ceasefire and ""an end to the war"".
Ukraine has publicly agreed to a 30-day ceasefire but Putin has only said Russia will work with Ukraine to craft a ""memorandum"" on a ""possible future peace"" - a move described by Kyiv and its European allies as delaying tactics. 
The first direct Ukrainian-Russian talks since 2022 were held on 16 May in Istanbul, Turkey.
Aside from a major prisoner of war swap last week, there was little or no progress on bringing a pause in fighting closer.
Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. This includes Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014."

Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently won a general election on a wave of anti-Trump sentiment, met the royal couple on the airport runway in Canada's capital.

King's big moment in Canada after Trump row
Why is King Charles in Canada, and what is the throne speech?
King's invitation to Canada sends a message to Trump - and the world
Representatives of Canada's First Nations communities were among the welcoming party, including an Algonquin group playing drums.
The King and Queen, on their first visit to Canada since the start of their reign, will go on to a community festival, before a formal meeting with Prime Minister Carney.
But the main purpose of the visit is the King's ""Speech from the Throne"" to Canada's Parliament on Tuesday, the first time a monarch will have delivered this for almost 50 years.
It is expected to include a defence of Canada's sovereignty and to reject claims it should be taken over by the US.
The King is following in the footsteps of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who delivered the speech in 1977 and opened Canada's Parliament in 1957.
The timing of this week's visit has been seen as a sign of solidarity with Canada, after calls from Trump for the country to become the 51st US state.
The US threat has inflamed public opinion with some businesses in Ottawa, as elsewhere in Canada, putting on displays of national identity such as ""Proudly Canadian"" posters.
Carney, when he visited Trump at the White House earlier this month, stressed that Canada was ""not for sale"" and that message is likely to be conveyed in the King's speech which is written on the advice of Canada's government.
Mark Carney won an election campaign promising to stand up to the US president
Former Canadian high commissioner to the UK Jeremy Kinsman said this was a message the King will be pleased to deliver.
""It's going to be very affirmative of Canadian sovereignty. And I can say personally that it's something that King Charles will celebrate saying. I have no doubt,"" said Mr Kinsman, who worked as a diplomat with the King when he was Prince of Wales.
The speech, to be delivered in French and English, will set out the Canadian government's policy agenda in a way that is similar to the King's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament in Westminster. 
But it is also expected to have lines asserting the independence of Canada - a Commonwealth country and Nato member.
Speaking ahead of the King's visit and State Opening, Carney said: ""This is an historic honour which matches the weight of our times.""
In terms of the ceremony, the King is expected to wear a suit, in an event that will be more low key than the crown and elaborate robes on display in the UK's opening of Parliament.
As well as the speech in Parliament, this brief trip will include community events in Ottawa and a chance to meet local leaders.
This royal visit will be something of a diplomatic balancing act. The King is head of state of both Canada and the UK - and in his UK role, the King has been helping to maintain good relations with the US, sending a warm personal letter to President Trump inviting him for a second state visit.
In Canada, he will be expected to reflect a very different message, with Canada's government rejecting Trump's ambition to take over the country.
Ahead of the visit, a royal source said: ""The King has long experience and great skill in walking that diplomatic tightrope.
""He's held in high regard around the globe and across the political spectrum, with good relations with world leaders who understand his unique position.""

Ghana's Foreign Affairs Minister has announced that the country has temporarily closed its embassy in the US capital amid an investigation into an alleged visa scam.
Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said the embassy will be shut following the ""damning findings"" of an audit team he put together to investigate alleged corruption at the Washington diplomatic mission.
The statement added that the closure would last ""a few days"" until a ""restructuring and systems overhaul"" is finalised. 
According to Ablakwa, a locally recruited staff member and ""collaborators"" were allegedly involved in a ""fraudulent"" scheme whereby they extracted money from visa and passport applicants. 
It is alleged that the scheme consisted of creating an unauthorised link on the embassy's website to redirect visa and passport applicants to a private firm where they were ""charged extra for multiple services"" without the knowledge of the foreign ministry.
Ablakwa added that the staff member ""kept the entire proceeds"" in their private account, and that the scheme had been going on for five years.
Applicants seeking visas were charged unapproved fees ranging from almost $30 (Â£22) to $60 by the private firm.
""This conduct has been reported to the attorney-general for possible prosecution and retrieval of funds obtained through fraudulent schemes,"" Ablakwa added.

The disappearance of a pregnant Irish woman almost three decades ago has been upgraded to a murder inquiry.
A new search is under way to try to find the remains of Fiona Pender, 25, who went missing in County Offaly.
She was last seen at about 06:00 on 23 August 1996 at her flat on Church Street, Tullamore.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) have now announced that their investigation into Ms Pender's disappearance has been reclassified as a murder investigation based on the entirety of the information available to investigators.
She went missing in a decade when a number of other young women also disappeared without trace in the same province of Leinster.
But Garda sources have always indicated that they do not believe her disappearance was linked to any of the other cases.
On Monday, gardaÃ­ confirmed that this missing person investigation has been re-classified as a murder investigation
A new search is also under way on open ground close to Killeigh, about 5km from Tullamore.
GardaÃ­ say the area will be subjected to excavation and technical and forensic examinations over the coming days.
Garda teams have conducted significant inquiries and what they describe as a sustained investigation over the last 28 years in an effort to establish what happened to Ms Pender.
During this time, investigators say they have collated thousands of documents and reports, taken more than 300 statements of evidence and retained a number of exhibits.
Extensive searches have been carried out and five people have been arrested and detained in connection with this investigation, according to police.
Ms Pender was described as 5'5"" in height, with long blonde hair and she was wearing bright coloured clothing and white leggings when she went missing.
She was seven months pregnant and was said to be looking forward to the birth at the time of her disappearance.
No one has been brought to justice for her disappearance.

GardaÃ­ have renewed their appeal to anyone who may have any information about the case and who has not contacted investigators to come forward.
They have also appealed for help from anyone who may have previously come forward but felt at the time they could not provide police with all the information they had about the disappearance of Ms Pender.
The Republic of Ireland's justice minister, Jim O'Callaghan, said he was briefed on further developments in the case on Monday, according to Irish broadcaster RTÃ.
Speaking in Limerick, O'Callaghan said Ms Pender's family have ""gone through a terrible time over the past 28 years or so"".
""I think it's incumbent upon anyone who has information to bring that information to the gardaÃ­ so that this investigation can be concluded,"" he added."

At least 54 Palestinians have been killed - most of them in a school building sheltering displaced families - during Israeli air strikes on Gaza overnight, hospital directors have told the BBC.
Fahmi Al-Jargawi School in Gaza City was housing hundreds of people from Beit Lahia, currently under intense Israeli military assault. At least 35 were reported to have been killed when the school was hit.
Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence said multiple bodies, including those of children, were recovered â many severely burned, after fires engulfed two classrooms serving as living quarters.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had targeted ""a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command and control centre"" there.

The IDF said the area was being used ""by the terrorists to plan... attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops"", and accused Hamas of using ""the Gazan population as human shields"". 
Video footage shared online showed large fires consuming parts of the school, with graphic images of severely burned victims, including children, and survivors suffering critical injuries.
Faris Afana, Northern Gaza ambulance service manager, said he arrived at the scene with crews to find three classrooms ablaze.
""There were sleeping children and women in those classrooms,"" he said. ""Some of them were screaming but we couldn't rescue them due to the fires. 
""I cannot describe what we saw due to how horrific it was.""
Local reports said the head of investigations for the Hamas police in northern Gaza, Mohammad Al-Kasih, was among the dead, along with his wife and children.
Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia in northern Gaza killed 19 people, according to the director of al-Ahli hospital Dr Fadel el-Naim. The Israeli military has not yet commented on what was being targeted.
The twin attacks are part of a broader Israeli offensive that has escalated in the northern part of the enclave over the past week.
The IDF said it hit 200 targets across Gaza in 48 hours as it continued its operations against what it called ""terrorist organisations"". 
Meanwhile, a senior Hamas official told the BBC on Monday that the group had agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal offered by US special envoy Steve Witkoff.
However, Witkoff told Reuters that what he had seen was ""completely unacceptable"" and that the proposal being discussed was not the same as his.
A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said the plan agreed to by Hamas includes the release of 10 Israeli hostages held by the group in two phases.
In exchange, there would be a 70-day truce, a gradual partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the release of an agreed number of Palestinian prisoners, including several hundred serving long or life sentences.
The BBC has approached the Israeli government for comment on the proposal. Israeli media quoted anonymous Israeli officials as saying the plan would be rejected.

As mediation efforts continued, an Israeli strike on the home of a Palestinian doctor in Gaza killed nine of her 10 children on Friday. Dr Alaa al-Najjar's 11-year-old son was injured, along with her husband, Hamdi al-Najjar, who is in critical condition.
The nine children - Yahya, Rakan, Raslan, Gebran, Eve, Rival, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra - were aged between just a few months old and 12. The Israeli military has said the incident is under review. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said two of its staff were killed in a strike on their home in Khan Younis the following day.
The killing of Ibrahim Eid, a weapon contamination officer, and Ahmad Abu Hilal, a security guard at the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah ""points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza"", the ICRC said, repeating its call for a ceasefire.
On Sunday, the head of a controversial US and Israeli-approved organisation planning to use private firms to deliver aid to Gaza resigned. 
In a statement by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), executive director Jake Wood said it had become apparent that plans to set up distribution hubs would not meet the ""humanitarian principles"" of independence and neutrality.
The UN and various humanitarian organisations have said they will not co-operate with the GHF, accusing it of being discriminatory over who will receive food.
Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March that lasted 11 weeks before it allowed limited aid to enter the territory in the face of warnings of famine and mounting international outrage.
The Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in Gaza, Cogat, said 107 lorries carrying aid were allowed into Gaza on Sunday. The UN says much more aid - between 500 to 600 lorries a day - is needed.
Meanwhile, 20 countries and organisations met in Madrid on Sunday to discuss ending the war in Gaza. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares called for an arms embargo on Israel if it did not stop its attacks.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Fifty-seven are still being held, about 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.
At least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

A Kenyan member of parliament who was allegedly abducted by unknown men after a church service on Sunday is being treated in hospital after being found on a coffee farm, former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has said. 
George Koimburi had been ""badly beaten"" and was in a ""very serious condition""  at the Karen Hospital in the capital Nairobi, Gachagua added.
A vocal critic of the government, Koimburi is allied with Gachagua, who was impeached by parliament and removed from office last year after falling-out with President William Ruto.  
The alleged abduction has sparked outrage, with the opposition accusing the government of intimidation. It has not yet commented on the allegation.

Police said they were investigating the incident, local media reported.
A motorcycle rider who first found Koimburi early on Monday morning is said to have alerted other people and his family, the reports added added. 
A widely shared video clip showed the MP lying on the ground, his clothes dishevelled and seemingly in pain.
On Sunday, Koimburi's wife told reporters that they were outside church, in his Juja constituency in central Kiambu county, when he was grabbed and bundled into a vehicle.
Koimburi was reportedly found at a coffee farm in the nearby Ruiru constituency, less than 10km (six miles) from where he had been allegedly abducted.
Speaking after visiting him in hospital, Gachagua  accused the government of targeting legislators who took a ""vocal stand against the government"".
There has been a wave of abductions in Kenya since mass protests against tax hikes broke out last year. The government has previously denied involvement in the kidnappings. 
Prominent opposition politician Kalonzo Musyoka said that opposition officials would meet on Tuesday to ""assess the current state of political harassment and intimidation in the country by the Kenya Kwanza [governing] regime"".
He raised concerns over how an MP, who was entitled to security by the police, could ""get abducted in broad daylight"". 
""It means Kenyans are on their own,"" Musyoka added.
In February, Koimburi was arrested and charged with forging his academic qualifications. He denied the charge and was released on bail.
Police are reported to be also investigating him over allegations of land fraud and misuse of government funds. He denies any wrongdoing.
His alleged abduction came weeks after MP Charles Ong'ondo Were was shot dead in the streets of Nairobi by gunmen on a motorcycle.
Police said several suspects had been arrested following what appeared to be a  ""targeted and predetermined"" assassination.
Many Kenyans are alarmed by the deteriorating security situation. 
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights says that more than 80 people have been abducted since mass protests broke out last June against an increase in taxation, in what was the biggest challenge to the authority of Ruto's government since it took office in 2022. 
The commission blamed the abductions on state security agencies, but they denied any involvement.
Earlier this month, Ruto said the government had taken action to prevent further abductions, but did not give details.

Former Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila is back in the country for the first time in two years, having arrived in the rebel-held eastern city of Goma, spokespeople for the rebels as well as a youth leader from his party have said.
Kabila's arrival comes after senators stripped him of his immunity over alleged support for the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group which has been fighting the Congolese army.
Kabila, who has previously denied links with the rebel group, recently decried the justice system , alleging it was ""exploited for political ends"".
The 53-year-old led DR Congo for 18 years, after succeeding his father Laurent, who was shot dead in 2001.

He handed power to President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi in 2019, but they later fell out.
Speaking to the BBC, a Goma youth leader for Kabila's People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD), confirmed earlier reports from the M23 that Kabila had arrived in Goma.
""Kabila should be allowed full access to the country. For us it is like a father has returned to his children,"" Innocent Mirimo told BBC Swahili.
Last month, the PPRD was banned by the authorities in the capital, Kinshasa, who accused of having an ""ambiguous attitude"" towards the capture of Congolese territory by the M23.
In a message on X, external, rebel spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka welcomed Kabila to Goma saying: ""We wish him a pleasant stay in the liberated areas.""
A similar message was shared by another spokesperson, Willy Ngoma.
The Congolese authorities accuse Kabila of war crimes and treason, alleging there is a ""substantial body of documents, testimony and material facts"" that link the former leader to the M23.
In a now-deleted YouTube video released on Friday, Kabila called the Congolese government a ""dictatorship"", and said there was a ""decline of democracy"" in the country.
Congolese government spokesperson, Patrick Muyaya, rejected Kabila's allegations, saying he had ""nothing to offer the country"".
Fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 first broke out in 2012 and ended in a peace deal the following year. But in 2021 the group took up arms again, saying the promises made in the deal had been broken.
Since the beginning of this year, the M23 has made major advances in the mineral-rich east, including taking Goma in January.
The conflict has led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians in the last few months. 
Kabila has been living outside the country for the past two years - he initially left to pursue a doctorate in South Africa. At the beginning of last month he said he would be returning to help find a solution to the conflict.

Uganda's army has announced the suspension of all military cooperation with Germany after accusing its ambassador, Matthias Schauer, of being involved in ""subversive activities"" and of being ""wholly unqualified"" to be in the East African state.
The army did not back up its claim but its decision signals a sharp deterioration in relations between the two nations. 
Rejecting the accusations, a German foreign ministry spokesperson called them ""absurd and without any merit"", the Reuters news agency reports.
The highly unusual attack on Schauer came after he reportedly raised concerns about army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is the president's son, at a meeting last week. 
On X recently, the general threatened to behead opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine.
Gen Kainerugaba also boasted about torturing Wine's bodyguard after detaining him.
Rights groups have long accused the Ugandan government of targeting the opposition, especially in the run-up to elections.
Wine is expected to run against President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power for nearly four decades, in an election due next year.
Museveni's critics allege that the government is run by a family dynasty - his wife,  Janet Museveni is the minister of education, and his brother, Gen Salim Saleh, is the chief coordinator of a government programme known as Operation Wealth Creation.
Gen Saleh held a private meeting with European Union (EU) diplomats last week,  where Schauer - Germany's ambassador to Uganda since 2020 - raised concerns about the army chief's controversial tweets, and the ""reputational damage"" it was causing to Uganda, local media reported. 
Gen Kainerugaba hit back with a post on Sunday, saying he was ""having issues"" with the German ambassador ""that has to do with him as a person"".
""He is wholly unqualified to be in Uganda. It has nothing to do with the great German people. Whom I admire a lot,""  he posted.
In a separate statement, army spokesman  Col Chris Magezi said Uganda was suspending with immediate effect all defence and military cooperation with Germany because of ""credible intelligence reports"" that Schauer was involved in ""subversive activities"". 
""The suspension will remain in force until the full resolution of the matter of the Ambassador's involvement with pseudo political-military forces operating in the country against the Ugandan government,"" the statement added, without giving evidence to substantiate its claims.
On its website, Germany's embassy in Uganda said that bilateral trade between the two nations was worth around $335m (Â£247m) in 2024, and their relationship was based on ""stability and trust"".
It did not give details of military cooperation between the two nations. 
Uganda is heavily involved in peacekeeping operations, including in Somalia where it is helping to fight armed Islamist groups trying to overthrow the government.

Austria's former chancellor Sebastian Kurz has won his appeal against a conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary committee. 
The court's ruling overturns last year's judgement and eight-month suspended prison sentence for the former political star. 
Once hailed a wunderkind of Europe's conservatives, the 38-year-old resigned as chancellor in 2021 and quit politics amid a series of allegations. 
Monday's acquittal removes a key obstacle to a potential political comeback, but he still faces investigation on separate corruption allegations.
Last year, Kurz was found guilty of perjury for giving false testimony to a parliamentary committee. 
The case against him centred over allegations that he had been involved in the selection of executives on a newly-created state holding company when he was chancellor, as opposed to being merely kept informed.
Kurz told a parliamentary probe in 2020 that he was ""involved in the sense of informed"". But the first trial judge deemed that declaration false and ruled that Kurz had played a more active role.
However in his appeal Kurz argued that the judge who had convicted him was biased. 
The appeal bench of three judges ruled in his favour on Monday, reading out in their judgement that Kurz ""was acquitted because the objective offence of giving false evidence was not fulfilled"".
Speaking to reporters outside court on Monday, Kurz said the years of accusations against him had ""now all collapsed"".
""There have been numerous court hearings - a huge amount of confrontation with these accusations. You have all witnessed how much this has been celebrated and that it has now all collapsed,"" he said.
He has also denied wrongdoing on the corruption allegations for which he is being investigated.
Prosecutors are yet to decide whether to charge him over the allegations that he used public money to pay for favourable media coverage and to fund polls which exaggerated support for him. 
Kurz has not publicly voiced an intention to return to politics yet.
Since quitting in 2021, he has been involved in several business ventures including the high-profile Dream cybsersecurity company, which he co-founded in 2023 with partners including the former boss of Israel's NSO firm that developed the controversial Pegasus spyware product.
Kurz had previously headed the conservative Austrian's People's Party, leading the party to victories in 2017 and 2019 on a hardline immigration stance.
The People's Party is still in charge in Austria after it managed to form a three-party coalition with the Social Democrats and a liberal party after elections last September.
However that vote was won by the far-right Freedom Party, who seized on voter frustrations on the economy and migration. Despite topping parliamentary elections for the first time, they failed to form government."

The Kremlin has rejected claims of potential Russian involvement in alleged arson attacks at properties connected to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling them ""ludicrous"".
It comes after media reports that UK security officials are investigating a potential link following three incidents earlier this month.
In response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: ""London tends to suspect Russia of [involvement in] all the bad things happening in Great Britain. 
""As a rule, all these suspicions are groundless and not backed up with any evidence.""
Three men, two Ukrainian nationals and a Romanian man, have been charged as part of a police investigation into the attacks.
Several UK newspapers have claimed MI5 is investigating the possibility the attacks were ordered by the Kremlin, citing unnamed Whitehall officials. 
Last week, Ukrainian national Petro Pochynok, 34, from north London, was charged by the Metropolitan Police with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.
Two other men have also been charged in connection with the fires. Roman Lavrynovych, 21, has been charged with arson with intent to endanger life, while Stanislav Carpiuc, 26,  has been charged with conspiracy to commit arson with intent to endanger life.
The three men, who have already appeared in court for initial hearings, have been remanded in custody until the next scheduled hearing at the Old Bailey in London on 6 June.
On 8 May, a car the prime minister had sold to a neighbour caught fire on the Kentish Town street where he lived before moving to Downing Street.
Three days later, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of an Islington house, where Sir Keir lived during the 1990s and which has since been converted into flats.
On 12 May, the fire brigade and police were called to a fire at the prime minister's private home on the same street as where the car fire took place.
Sir Keir previously described the incidents as ""an attack on all of us, on democracy and the values that we stand for"".
Downing Street and the Metropolitan Police have so far declined to comment on reports that potential Russian involvement is being investigated."

The head of an organisation set up to distribute aid in Gaza as part of a controversial Israel-backed plan has resigned, saying it could not work in a way that adhered to ""humanitarian principles"".
Jake Wood quit the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) late on Sunday, saying it would not be able to fulfil the principles of ""humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence"".
The plan, also backed by the US, will have private contractors delivering aid via Israel-designated distribution sites. It was criticised by the UN, which says it will not participate.
The GHF said on Monday night that it had delivered its first aid shipments to Gaza and distribution to the Gazan people was under way.
Under the GHF plan, Palestinians would be expected to collect boxes weighing up to 20kg (44lbs) containing food and basic hygiene items from four distribution points in southern Gaza. 
It is unclear how the weak or injured would be able to collect the aid.
Israel insists the plan is needed to stop Hamas stealing aid, which the armed group denies doing.
UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said it would force further displacement, restrict aid to only one part of Gaza and make ""starvation a bargaining chip.""
In his resignation statement, Wood, a former US marine, said: ""Two months ago, I was approached about leading GHF's efforts because of my experience in humanitarian operations.
""Like many others around the world, I was horrified and heartbroken at the hunger crisis in Gaza and, as a humanitarian leader, I was compelled to do whatever I could to help alleviate the suffering.""
He said he was ""proud of the work I oversaw, including developing a pragmatic plan that could feed hungry people, address security concerns about diversion, and complement the work of longstanding NGOs in Gaza.""
But, he said, it had become ""clear that it is not possible to implement this plan while also strictly adhering to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence, which I will not abandon.""
In response, the GHF said it would ""not be deterred"" by Wood's resignation and would begin delivering aid on Monday, with an aim to reach one million Palestinians by the end of the week.
The group said that critics ""who benefit from the status quo have been more focused on tearing this apart than on getting aid in, afraid that new, creative solutions to intractable problems might actually succeed.""
It added: ""Our trucks are loaded and ready to go.""
An Israeli official said ""the goal of this new approach is to eliminate the Gazan population's dependence on Hamas"".
Israeli media reported that the first of four distribution centres would be opened by GHF on Monday morning.
Last week, Israel eased an 11-week blockade on all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies entering Gaza, with the first aid trucks reaching civilians in recent days - but the UN has said it's a ""drop in the ocean of what's needed"".
It says 57 children died from malnutrition during Israel's blockade - while the World Food Programme (WFP) warned last week that Gaza's entire population was ""on the brink of starvation"".
Children in Gaza are suffering from malnutrition, UN bodies say 
Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC's Today Programme that the GHF is ""militarised, privatised, politicised"" and ""not in conformity with neutrality"".
""The people behind it are military â they are ex-CIA and ex-military peopleâ¦ Let's go back to the system that worked"" he said.
The GHF has also come under intense scrutiny around its funding, origins and backing. 
On Monday evening, it announced John Acree, a former senior manager at USAID, had been named interim executive director.
Over the weekend, an investigation by The New York Times, external suggested the group may have been conceived in Israel by a group of Israeli officials and military officers and their partners in the Israeli business sector.
Responding to the plan earlier this month, UN children's fund spokesperson Jonathan Crickx said: ""How is a mother of four children, who has lost her husband, going to carry 20kg back to her makeshift tent, sometimes several kilometres away?"" 
""The most vulnerable people, including the elderly, people with disabilities, the sick and wounded, and orphans, will face huge challenges to access aid."" 
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

A search and rescue specialist hired to recover a downed research balloon in what was supposed be a four-day job has finally returned home after spending more than 100 days in a West African prison.
Paul Inch, 50, from Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, and colleague Richard Perham, 29, from Bristol, had gone to Guinea to recover the equipment for a firm when they were arrested and accused of spying.
""It was scary - the worst thing I have ever experienced,"" said Mr Inch.
Lord Collins of Highbury, UK government Foreign Office minister for Africa, welcomed the men's return after their ""lengthy ordeal"". The Guinean government has been asked to comment. 
""We were threatened with all kinds of abuse,"" said Mr Inch, who works as a mountain bike guide, water safety officer, and as a volunteer with the Aberglaslyn Mountain Rescue.
He described the conditions in the Conakry prison as ""horrific"", with 80 men sharing a toilet and shower.
""Sleeping through the night you'd have rats and mice and cockroaches crawling over your body,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.
Mr Inch said the water was contaminated so they washed with a disinfectant and were concerned about becoming unwell.
He explained how he and his colleague had believed they ""had the right permissions  to be [in Guinea]... and then quickly found out that we hadn't"".
""We were in court and then told 'you're going to prison',"" he said.
Richard Perham says the ordeal was like being ""trapped in a nightmare""
Mr Perham said: ""We had to literally fear for our lives each day. 
""After we had been there for two months, the UK ambassador walked us to the prison gate, believing we were finally being released but a phone call to the prosecutor stopped it. 
""We had to turn around and walk straight back in for another month. It was devastating.""
Paul Inch from Blaenau Ffestiniog has returned home after spending more than 100 days in a West African prison.
After their release on 11 April, the pair were stuck in Guinea for 42 more days.
Mr Inch's partner, Cheryl Potter, said: ""Every single day has been a constant battle worrying about him.""
Mr Inch has thanked his supporters, the British Embassy and his local MP, Liz Saville Roberts, for their help to get them home.

Paul Inch's partner Cheryl described the ordeal as ""absolutely awful""
Ms Saville Roberts said the organisation that hired the pair had informed Guinean authorities that Mr Inch and Mr Perham ""had no role in operating the balloon, no knowledge of its technical contents, and no involvement in its flight or descent"". 
""Their assignment was purely logistical: retrieving equipment under the understanding that all permissions had been granted,"" said the Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd.
""This has been a nightmare for the two men and their families and friends who have been focused, resourceful and determined to ensure that never a day went by without seeking their release."""

Venezuela's ruling party is celebrating what it has described as ""an overwhelming victory"" in regional and parliamentary elections, which were boycotted by the majority of opposition parties.
The electoral council (CNE), which is dominated by government loyalists, says candidates for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela's (PSUV) - President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's party - won the race for governor in 23 out of the country's 24 states.
According to the CNE, the ruling coalition also won 82.68% of the votes cast for the National Assembly, Venezuela's legislative body. 
The main opposition parties called the elections a ""farce"". Opposition leader, MarÃ­a Corina Machado, said turnout had been below 15%.
Opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado has been in hiding for months, following a wave of repression after the presidential election
""More than 85% of Venezuelans did not obey this regime and said 'no',"" Machado said about those who abstained.
Independent journalists who visited polling stations throughout the day said that they saw no queues and fewer people turning out than for the presidential election last July.
The CNE meanwhile put the turn-out at 42.6%.
The opposition has long questioned the independence of the CNE, which is led by Elvis Amoroso, a former legal counsel to President Maduro.
The CNE came in for widespread international criticism in last year when it declared Mr Maduro the winner of the presidential election without ever providing the detailed voting tallies to back up their claim. 
Venezuela's opposition, meanwhile, published voting tallies it had gathered with the help of official election observers which showed that its candidate, Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez, was the overwhelming winner. 
Amid the wave of repression and arrests which followed the presidential election, GonzÃ¡lez went into exile to Spain. 
Machado, who threw her weight behind presidential hopeful Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez after she was barred from running for public office, remained in Venezuela.
She was the main advocate for boycotting this Sunday's legislative and gubernatorial elections, saying that the result of July's presidential election should be respected before any new elections are held.
""We voted on 28 July. On 25 May, we won't vote,"" she said in a video message shared earlier this month. 
However, a handful of opposition politicians did run for office, arguing that leaving the field open to government candidates was a mistake.
Among them were former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, Zulia state governor Manuel Rosales and Juan Requesens, who was jailed by the Maduro government for allegedly taking part in a 2018 drone attack on the president. 
Capriles told Spanish daily El PaÃ­s that for him ""voting in Venezuela is an expression of resistance, of resilience, of not giving up"".
Their decision to stand in the elections was criticised by those calling for a boycott, with Machado saying they had ""betrayed the cause"". 
Opposition leader Henrique Capriles refused to be part of the boycott and encouraged his followers to vote
With turnout low, President Maduro's PSUV party sailed to victory in 23 of the 24 gubernatorial races, up from the 20 governor posts it previously held.
According to the preliminary results of the legislative election, the coalition backing President Maduro won an absolute majority of the 285 seats. 
But three politicians from Henrique Capriles' opposition UNT party were also voted into the National Assembly, including Capriles himself. 
Maduro has hailed the result as a ""victory of peace and stability"" and celebrated the fact that his party had regained control of the states of Zulia and, in particular, Barinas, the home state of his predecessor in office and political mentor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
Only the state of Cojedes will now be in opposition hands, following the re-election of opposition candidate Alberto GalÃ­ndez.
Sunday's vote was preceded by a wave of arrests, which saw more than 70 people with links to the opposition detained for allegedly ""planning to sabotage the election"".
Among those detained is Juan Pablo Guanipa, 60, a close ally of MarÃ­a Corina Machado. The interior minister accused him of being ""one of the leaders of this terrorist network"" which he claimed had been plotting to disrupt the election by planting bombs at key sites. 
Machado said his arrest and those of dozens of others was ""state terrorism, pure and simple"".
Venezuelan voters were also asked to choose representatives for the Essequibo region, a territory long administered and controlled by neighbouring Guyana which Venezuela claims as its own. 
The territorial dispute has been submitted by Guyana to the International Court of Justice, which had ordered Venezuela to refrain from conducting elections for representatives for the region, an order which the Maduro government defied.
As Venezuela is not in control of the Essequibo, there were no polling stations in the territory nor did the people living there get a chance to vote. 
Instead, voters in a small district expressly created for the purpose on the Venezuelan side of the border were asked to cast their vote, which will have only symbolic value. 
Neil Villamizar, an admiral loyal to President Maduro, won the unusual vote and will now be declared ""governor of Essequibo"" by the Venezuelan government even though he has no power or control over the territory, which remains in Guyanese hands. 
The president of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, has denounced the move as a ""scandalous, false, propagandistic, opportunistic"" and has said he will ""do everything to ensure our territorial integrity and sovereignty is kept intact""."

A college in Beijing has found itself at the centre of public fury after it allegedly asked a student to prove she was on her period to qualify for sick leave.
A viral video, filmed inside what appears to be a clinic and posted to social media this month, shows a young woman asking an older woman: ""Does every menstruating girl have to take off their trousers and show you before they can get a sick note?""
""Basically yes,"" the older woman replies. ""This is a school rule.""
Local media identified the video's location as a clinic at the Gengdan Institute university college, which later said in a statement that its staff had ""followed protocol"". But social media users have decried the encounter as a serious invasion of privacy.
Neither the student nor Gengdan Institute immediately responded to BBC News' requests for comment.
Both the student's video and the school's statement appear to have been taken down, though screenshots and snippets have been recirculated online, including by state media.
On Douyin, China's TikTok, a user claiming to be the student said her original account was suspended for 30 days for ""pornographic content"" after she posted the video.
In its statement dated 16 May, Gengdan Institute reportedly said the videos of the incident circulating online had been ""distorted"" - and that the institution had the right to pursue legal action against those who ""maliciously spread untrue videos"".
The statement also said that the staff had followed the proper procedure during the encounter, such as ""initiating clinical work after getting the student's permission"", and did not use tools or conduct a physical examination.
In the video, the staff member did not reply when the student asked for written proof of the school regulation to check students' menstrual status. She subsequently asked the student to go to a hospital instead.
On social media, the incident has triggered an outpouring of anger and sarcasm towards the school's rules.
""My head hurts, should I open my skull and call it a day?"" wrote one social media user.
""Let's just take the sanitary pad out and paste it on the sick note,"" another Weibo said.
A staff member at Gengdan Institute told local outlet Dute News that the school may have created the rule about proving menstruation in order to deter students from faking periods to get sick notes.
But that argument has rung hollow among social media users. 
""If they're worried about students using their periods as an excuse several times a month, why not simply make a record of it? It's not that complicated,"" one person wrote on Weibo.
State media has also waded into the debate.
""Menstruation is already an intimate topic for women. Rules like this will make students feel very uncomfortable, and even negatively impact students' psychological wellbeing,"" reads an opinion piece from China National Radio.
Gengdan Institute now joins a list of tertiary institutions across the country that have come under fire for what many see as overbearing and ham-fisted attempts at controlling their students.
Last year, some universities were criticised for banning the use of bed curtains in their dormitories. The curtains are often used by students for privacy in shared rooms, but school authorities said they were a fire and safety hazard.
Additionally, during the popular May Day holiday season last year, some universities issued strict guidelines for students who had planned to travel. These included avoiding solo trips, road trips, or cycling trips for safety - which many saw as the institutions overstepping their authority in students' private lives.
On social media site Xiaohongshu, a user claiming to be a student at Gengdan Institute said ""the school's clinic deserves all the criticism it's getting"".
""I heard from some older students that this kind of thing has been going on for a while. Some girls spoke up before, but nothing was done,"" the user wrote.
""I'm glad it made the trending topics this time. People didn't stay silent."""

Authorities in India's southern Kerala state have issued an alert after a ship carrying oil and hazardous cargo leaked and sank off the state's coast in the Arabian Sea.
The spill occurred in a Liberian-flagged vessel that capsized near Kochi city on Sunday. The coastal stretch is rich in biodiversity and is also an important tourist destination.
All 24 crew members on board the ship have been rescued but some of the ship's 640 containers have reportedly been drifting, external towards the shore, prompting evacuations in the area. 
Authorities fear that oil, fuel and other harmful substances that have leaked from the ship and its cargo could endanger the health of residents and marine life.
""As the oil slick can reach anywhere along the Kerala coast, an alert has been sounded across the coastal belt,"" a statement from the chief minister's office said. 
Authorities have advised residents living near the sea to not touch any containers or the oil that might wash up to the shore, while fishermen have been asked to avoid venturing too close to the sunken ship.
On Monday, officials said they had intensified pollution control measures to contain the spill.
The Indian Coast Guard has deployed a ship carrying pollution control equipment to the site.
It has also sent one of its aircraft which has an oil spill detection system to survey the area.
The vessel - MSC ELSA 3 - which was travelling from Vizhinjam port to Kochi, began to tilt dangerously when it was about 38 nautical miles from the coast of Kochi. 
It capsized into the Arabian Sea in the early hours of Sunday due to flooding in one of its compartments. 
The Indian Coast Guard said that the ship was carrying 13 containers of hazardous cargo and 12 with calcium carbide - a chemical that reacts with seawater to release a flammable gas.
""Additionally, [the] ship had 84.44 metric tonnes of diesel and 367.1 metric tonnes of furnace oil in its tanks,"" it said.
The crew members were rescued by Indian navy personnel after an hours-long operation."

North Korea has arrested a fourth official over the failed launch of a new warship that has enraged the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri Hyong-son, deputy director of the ruling Workers' Party's Munitions Industry Department, was ""largely responsible for the serious accident"" last week, state-run news agency KCNA said on Monday.
The 5,000-ton destroyer had tipped over and damaged its hull, in what Kim described as a ""criminal act"" that ""severely damaged the [country's] dignity and pride"".
The vessel is being repaired under the guidance of an expert group, KCNA said.
Mr Ri, who is part of the party's Central Military Commission, is the highest level official arrested over the incident so far. 
The commission commands the Korean People's Army and is responsible for developing and implementing North Korea's military policies. 
Over the weekend, Pyongyang also detained three officials at the northern Chongjin shipyard, where the destroyer was built and where its launch failed. 
The officials were the chief engineer, its construction head and an administrative manager.
Kim earlier said Wednesday's incident was caused by ""absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism"". 
It is not clear what punishment they might face, but the authoritarian state has been known to sentence officials it finds guilty of wrongdoing to forced labour and even death.
It is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents, though it has done this a handful of times in the past after failed satellite launches.
Some analysts believe Kim's swift and severe response was meant as a signal that Pyongyang will continue to advance its military capabilities.
While such criticism is ""not surprising"" for a dictatorship, it is unusual that state media is openly reporting it, says Chun In-bum, a former commander of South Korea's special forces. 
""I fear this might be a sign of confidence and a show of resilience,"" he says.
""With this new line of ships, North Korea seems to intend on challenging the sovereignty of the South in earnest.""
Michael Madden, a North Korea expert from the Stimson Center in Washington, sees Kim's response as a sign of the ""high priority"" his regime is putting into developing warships.
The mishap may have resulted from officials ""trying to do too much at once"", he notes, saying that ""there seems to have been an unusual amount of internal pressure on the personnel and production units to get this all done"".
Last week's shipyard accident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a similar warship in another part of the country. 
Kim had called that warship a ""breakthrough"" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year."

A fight involving machetes at a Melbourne shopping centre has prompted an Australian state to fast-track the country's first-ever ban on the weapon's sale. 
The ban - to start in Victoria this Wednesday, instead of September - comes after two gangs attacked each other at Northland shopping centre in Preston on Sunday afternoon. A man, 20, remains in hospital in a serious condition.
Victoria's premier said the ban will ""choke the supply"", adding ""the community shouldn't have to deal with these weapons in their shopping centres - neither should our police"".
Two boys, aged 16 and 15, were on Sunday charged with affray, intentionally causing injury, and possession and use of a controlled weapon. 
On Monday, police said two men, aged 20 and 18, had also been arrested and were being interviewed. All four people were known to police previously. 
""This was a planned fight between two rival youth gangs with no innocent bystanders hurt,"" said deputy commissioner David Clayton. 
""Fortunately, these events are not very commonplace in Victoria,"" he said, adding that youth knife crime is ""rare"" but ""frightening"".
Clayton said one in 10 knife crimes in the state is committed by young people, and often happen in public places. 
Emergency services were called to the shopping centre in Preston - about 11km (seven miles) north of Melbourne - just after 14:30 local time (05:30 BST) on Sunday after reports of up to 10 people fighting. 
Police said the investigation ""remains ongoing"" and more arrests are expected. Three of the four machetes used during the attack have been seized, police said.
Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan described the attack as ""appalling"". 
""We must never let the places where we gather - where families come together, to meet, to shop, to enjoy the peace of their weekend - become the places we fear,"" Allan said at a press conference. 
""It took the United Kingdom 18 months to bring about a ban on machetes and we are moving to do it within six months,"" she added.
In March, Victoria announced legislative changes to its Control of Weapons Act, making it illegal to sell or possess machetes, with the new law to start in September. 
The ban covers machetes, which are broadly defined as ""knives with a cutting blade longer than 20cm"". It does not include knives primarily used in kitchens.
A three-month amnesty from September means anyone with a machete can place them in specially designated boxes at police stations. 
Police also thanked a man who held down one of the alleged offenders until police arrived, saying he ""performed an outstanding job"", but added they don't encourage the public to become involved in such incidents. 
In England and Wales, a ban on ""zombie-style"" knives and machetes was introduced last September, making it illegal to own, make, transport or sell a wide range of ""statement"" knives favoured by criminal gangs."

Five kittens heard crying for help under a shipping container in Bahrain have been saved by Royal Navy sailors.
Personnel serving at the UK Naval Support Facility, which supports the Portsmouth-based HMS Lancaster, found the three-week-old kittens, which had not been weaned, after their mother died.
Between shifts the sailors took turns to foster, hand-feed, and rear the little cats while searching for a new permanent home for them.
Lt Nathan Boal said: ""It was impossible to ignore the desperate cries of five tiny kittens knowing they wouldn't survive one day on their own in the punishing heat.""
They were found under a shipping container
Temperatures in the Gulf kingdom have approached 40C (104F) in recent weeks.
Lt Boal said: ""They were too young even to eat or drink by themselves.
""I witnessed the caring side of our sailors as well as incredible teamwork to save these helpless animals and I'm relieved that our efforts saved them.""
Petty Officer Kirsty Scott and Lt Nathan Boal got acquainted with the tiny creatures
Petty Officer Kirsty Scott, who was one of the sailors who became a kitten carer, said: ""We knew the mother, whom we fondly named Michelle.
""When we discovered her kittens, we were upset to find she had passed away and they were left to fend for themselves. 
""They would come running out crying from the shipping containers at the sight of personnel looking for food. There was no way we could leave them suffering.""
The Royal Navy said despite the team's best efforts, one of the litter died, though the rest ""came through some difficult hours to thrive â receiving a clean bill of health from a local vet"".
The kittens were taken in by sailors after their mother died
A home has since been found for the survivors, though saying goodbye was ""emotional â but sweetened by the satisfaction of knowing the litter would have a bright future"".

Americans across the country remembered George Floyd five years after he was killed by police, with special gatherings in the city where he grew up and the one where he died.
The murder of Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis by police officer Derek Chauvin led to nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. 
On Sunday, Floyd's family gathered in their hometown of Houston near Floyd's gravesite for a service led by the Rev Al Sharpton, while Minneapolis held several commemorations.
What many hailed as a national ""reckoning"" with racism after Floyd's death, though, seems to be fading as President Donald Trump starts to roll back police reforms in Minneapolis and other cities.
Attendees of a morning church service embrace each other
The Associated Press reported that thousands of people, including police reform and civil-rights activists, gathered on Sunday for the anniversary. 
In Minneapolis, a morning church service and evening gospel concert  were part of events to mark the events of 25 May 2020, at the annual Rise and Remember Festival in George Floyd Square, the intersection where Floyd was murdered and which has since been named to honour him. 
""Now is the time for the people to rise up and continue the good work we started,""  Angela Harrelson, Floyd's aunt and co-chair of the Rise and Remember nonprofit, said in a statement about the festival.  
Community members and Floyd's relatives gathered around a mural at George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Friday. 
Family members held a memorial service at Floyd's gravesite
In Houston, where Floyd grew up and where he is buried, local organisations held poetry sessions, musical performances and speeches by local pastors.
Rev Sharpton, a civil rights leader, held a press conference and memorial service with Floyd's family, as well as elected officials and friends. They called for changes  begun in the wake of Floyd's to continue, especially pushing President Donald Trump to keep up federal police reform agreements.
Floyd was murdered in 2020 during a police arrest in Minneapolis when Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes. 
The killing - captured on a bystander's phone camera - sparked global outrage and a wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police use of force.
Chauvin has been serving a 22-year prison sentence after he was convicted of murdering the 46-year-old. Other officers were convicted for failing to intervene in the killing. 
In a post on X, Rev Sharpton said Floyd's death had ""forced a long overdue reckoning with systemic racism and galvanized millions to take to the streets in protest"". 
""The conviction of the officer responsible was a rare step toward justice, but our work is far from over,"" he said. 
In the wake of Floyd's death, under former President Joe Biden, the justice department opened civil investigations into several local law enforcement agencies, including Minneapolis, Louisville, Phoenix and Lexington, Mississippi, where investigators found evidence of systemic police misconduct.
Floyd's death sparked a nationwide reckoning on police brutality toward black people in the US in 2020
The department reached agreements with both the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments that included oversight measures like enhanced training, accountability, and improved data collection of police activity.
But last Wednesday, the Trump administration said those findings relied on ""flawed methodologies and incomplete data"".
Administration officials said the agreement were ""handcuffing"" local police departments. 
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, though, said this week that his city would still ""comply with every sentence, of every paragraph, of the 169-page consent decree that we signed this year"".
Since returning to office, Trump has also taken aim at Diversity Equity & Inclusion (DEI) measures intended to reduce racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination. Early in his tenure, Trump signed an executive order to eliminate DEI policies in the federal government, some of which were the result of protests during what is often called ""Black Lives Matter Summer"", held after the deaths of Floyd and others,  
Critics including Trump say such programmes can themselves be discriminatory. Addressing West Point on Saturday, he said that in ending DEI in the military the administration was ""getting rid of the distractions"" and ""focusing our military on its core mission"".
Meanwhile, the mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, removed Black Lives Matter Plaza, a strip of road that was emblazoned with the phrase near the White House. This week, a famous mural of Floyd in Houston was destroyed as part of a building demolition, as well, according to Houston Public Media. 
Recent surveys suggest Americans believe there have been few improvements for the lives of black people in the US five years after Floyd's passing, including a May survey, external from Pew Research Center in which 72% of participants said there had been no meaningful changes. 
The number of Americans expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement has also fallen by 15% since June 2020, the same survey suggests."

The US will impose new sanctions on Sudan after finding it used chemical weapons last year in the ongoing civil war against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the state department has said.
US exports to the country will be restricted and financial borrowing limits put in place from 6 June, a statement from spokesperson Tammy Bruce read.
A Sudanese government spokesperson described the accusations as ""baseless claims with no supporting evidence"".
Both the Sudanese military and the paramilitary group the RSF have previously been accused of war crimes during the conflict, which they have denied.
More than 150,000 people have been killed during the conflict, which began two years ago when Sudan's army and the RSF began a vicious struggle for power.
In recent months, Sudan's military has recaptured the capital of Khartoum, but fighting continues elsewhere.
No detail was provided about which chemical weapons the US said it found, but the New York Times reported in January that Sudan used chlorine gas on two occasions, which causes a range of painful and damaging effects and can be fatal.
This was said to have been in remote areas which were not named. No visual evidence has been shared so far as proof of the weapons having been used in the current war in Sudan.
""The United States calls on the government of Sudan to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations under the CWC,"" the statement read, referring to the Chemical Weapons Convention under which signatories have committed to destroy their stockpiles of the weapons. 
In a strongly worded statement, Sudan's Culture and Information Minister Khalid Al-Ayesir described the US's actions as ""political blackmail"", adding that they further eroded US ""credibility"" and eliminated ""any remaining influence it may have in Sudan"".
He said it was a ""fabricated narrative... to mislead international opinion and offer political cover to illegitimate actors complicit in crimes against the Sudanese people"".
He said the US had previously made ""false claims"" about chemical weapons in Sudan, pointing to the 1998 Al-Shifa attack, when the US  bombed a Sudanese pharmaceutical factory.
At the time the US had alleged the factory was being used as a site to manufacture chemical weapons and was linked to Osama Bin-Laden's network, which Sudan strongly denied.
After the bombing, the US lifted a decision to freeze the assets of the factory owner, which was viewed at the time as an implicit acknowledgment that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the bombing.
Sudan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its ""deep astonishment"" at the approach taken by the US, saying in a statement provided to the BBC that the US had failed to go through the appropriate channels to raise the matter.
It denied the allegations that it had used chemical weapons as ""baseless"" and denounced the sanctions, saying it remains ""fully committed"" to its obligations under the convention.
The ministry also accused the US of a history of ""using false allegations to threaten the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of other states"", without offering evidence.
Nearly every country in the world - including Sudan - has agreed to the CWC, apart from Egypt, North Korea and South Sudan according to the Arms Control Association, a US-based non-partisan membership organisation. Israel has signed the agreement but not ratified its signature, meaning it has not legally confirmed its involvement in the treaty, the ACA adds.
""The United States remains fully committed to hold to account those responsible for contributing to chemical weapons proliferation,"" Bruce added.
This is not the first time the US has imposed sanctions in Sudan. In January, they were issued against leaders of both parties embroiled in the conflict.
Sudan's military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was accused of ""destabilising Sudan and undermining the goal of a democratic transition"" by the US, which the country's foreign ministry condemned as ""strange and troubling"".
Meanwhile, the head of the RSF Mohammed Hamdan Daglo, also known as Hemedti, was determined to have perpetrated genocide in the country by former secretary of state Antony Blinken. The RSF has denied these charges.
The rival forces have been struggling for power for the past two years, displacing around 12 million people and leaving 25 million needing food aid, more than double the population of London.
New sanctions will have little effect on the country as a result of these prior measures, according to the AFP news agency.
This latest US move comes amid tensions over the alleged involvement of the United Arab Emirates in the conflict. The UAE and Sudan had maintained diplomatic ties until earlier this month when the Sudanese government alleged the UAE provided arms to the RSF, an allegation the UAE denies.
Following US President Donald Trump's warm reception in the Gulf state last week, Democrats in Congress sought to block the sale of arms from the US to the UAE in part due to its alleged involvement in the conflict.
A Sudanese diplomatic source told news agency Reuters that the US had imposed the new sanctions ""to distract from the recent campaign in Congress against the UAE"".
Earlier this month, a top UN court rejected Sudan's bid to sue the UAE for genocide.

Last month, he announced a 20% tariff - or import tax - on most EU goods, but later cut this to 10% to allow time for negotiations. On Friday, Trump expressed frustration with the pace of talks and threatened to raise the tariff rate to an even higher level of 50% as soon as 1 June. 
On Sunday, he wrote on social media that he was pushing his deadline back to 9 July, after a ""very nice"" call with Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission chief. 
Von der Leyen echoed Trump's assessment of the call and said the bloc was ""ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively"".
But, in her own online post, von der Leyen wrote: ""To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.""
Trump's acceptance of that date means the deadline is close to what it was previously. Before threatening the 50% rate, Trump had set a deadline of 8 July for both sides to talk. 
Trump has long criticised what he views as an unfair US trading relationship with the EU, despite the bloc being one of Washington's largest trading partners. Last year, the EU exported more than $600bn (â¬528bn; Â£443bn) in goods to the US while importing $370bn worth, according to US government data.
More broadly, the US president has defended his wide-ranging programme of tariffs by arguing they will boost American manufacturing and protect jobs.
But his planned import taxes have thrown the world economy into chaos, and many economist say they will make products more expensive for US consumers. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries, paid by the companies that that bring foreign goods into the US.
In the case of the EU, the president has raised concerns on trade in cars and agricultural goods. Although some tariffs were paused earlier this year to allow for negotiations, a 25% levy on EU steel and aluminium remains in place.
What tariffs has Trump announced and why?

Faisal Islam: Trump's tariff plans could spark global economic shock
It was while speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon - hours before talks with the bloc - that Trump said he planned to raise tariffs on all goods sent to the US from the EU to 50% by 1 June.
He expressed impatience with the ongoing negotiations. 
Later the same day, the EU's trade chief Maros Sefcovic reaffirmed the bloc's commitment to securing a fair deal.
Following a call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Sefcovic said: ""The EU's fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both.""
He continued: ""EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.""
The EU has threatened - and paused - its own measures against the US.
It previously said it would introduce a 25% tariff on â¬18bn worth of US goods coming into Europe but this was put on hold.
The bloc is also currently consulting on additional measures against US imports into the US valued at â¬95bn.
At the same time, European leaders continue to warn against escalation. France and Germany have called for a diplomatic solution, stressing that tariffs would harm both economies."

Ngabi Dora Tue, consumed by grief, was barely able to stand on her own.
The coffin of her husband, Johnson Mabia, sat amid a crowd of stricken mourners in Limbe in Cameroon's South-West region - an area that had witnessed scenes like this many times before.
While on a work trip, Johnson - an English-speaking civil servant - and five colleagues were captured by armed separatists.
The militants were - and still are - fighting for the independence of Cameroon's two anglophone regions in what is a predominantly francophone country. A near-decade-long conflict that has led to thousands of deaths and stunted life in the area.
When he was abducted four years ago, Dora struggled to reach Johnson. When she eventually heard from separatist militants, they asked for a ransom of over $55,000 (Â£41,500) to be paid within 24 hours in order to secure his release. Dora then received another call from one of Johnson's relatives.
""He saidâ¦  that I should take care of the children. That my husband is no more. I didn't even know what to do. Tuesday he was travelling, and he was kidnapped. Friday he was killed,"" says Dora.
The separatists responsible had not just murdered but decapitated Johnson, and left his body on the road.
What began as demonstrations in 2016 and 2017 then escalated into a conflict
The roots of the separatist struggle lie in long-standing grievances that stretch back to full independence in 1961, and the formation of a single Cameroonian state in 1972 from former British and French territories.
Since then the English-speaking minority have felt aggrieved at the perceived erosion of rights by the central government. Johnson was just an innocent by-stander, caught up in an increasingly brutal fight for self-determination and the government's desperate attempts to stamp out the uprising.
The current wave of violence began almost a decade ago.
In late 2016, peaceful protests started against what was perceived to be the creeping use of the francophone legal system in the region's courtrooms. The French- and English-speaking parts of Cameroon use different judicial systems.
The protests rapidly spread, and led to a call for the closing of shops and institutions.
The response of the security forces was immediate and severe - people were beaten, intimidated and there were mass arrests. The African Union called it ""a deadly and disproportionate use of violence"".
Cameroon's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment on this or other issues in this article.
Armed groups were set up. And, in late 2017 as tensions escalated, anglophone separatist leaders declared independence for what they called the Federal Republic of Ambazonia.
To date, five million anglophone Cameroonians have been dragged into the conflict - equivalent to one-fifth of the total population. At least 6,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes.
""We used to wake up in the morning to dead bodies on the streets,"" says Blaise Eyong, a journalist from Kumba in the English-speaking South-West region of Cameroon, who has produced and presented a documentary on the crisis for BBC Africa Eye, and was forced from his hometown with his family in 2019.  
""Or you hear that a house has been set ablaze. Or you hear that someone was kidnapped. People's body parts chopped off. How do you live in a city where every single morning you're worried if your relatives are safe?""
There have been a number of national and international attempts to resolve the crisis, including what the government called ""a major national dialogue"" in 2019.
Although the talks established a special status for the country's two anglophone regions which acknowledged their unique history, very little was resolved in practical terms.
Felix Agbor Nkongho - a barrister who was one of the leaders of the 2016 protests and was later arrested - says that with both sides now seeming to act with impunity, the moral high ground has disappeared.
""There was a timeâ¦ where most people felt that, if they needed security, they would go to the separatists,"" he tells BBC Africa Eye.
""But over the last two years, I don't think any reasonable person would think that the separatists would be the ones to protect them. So everybody should die for us to have independence and I ask the question: who are you going to govern?""
But it is not just the separatists who are accused of abuses.
Organisations such as Human Rights Watch have recorded the brutal response of the security forces to the anglophone independence movement. They have documented the burning of villages and the torture, unlawful arrests and extrajudicial killings of people in a war largely unseen by the outside world.
Examples of state-sponsored brutality are not difficult to find.
John, who talked to BBC Africa Eye on condition of anonymity, was tortured and forced into signing a document without being allowed to read its content
John (not his real name) and a close friend were taken into custody by Cameroonian military forces, accused of buying weapons for a separatist group.
John recalls that after being incarcerated, they were given a document which they were told to sign without being given the chance to read its contents. When they refused, the torture began.
""That is when they separated us into different rooms,"" says John.  ""They tortured [my friend]. You could just hear them flogging everywhere. I could feel it on my own body [too]. They beat me everywhere. Later they told me he accepted and signed and they allowed him to go.""
But that was not the truth.
A month after his arrest, another man arrived in John's cell. He told him that his friend had, in fact, died in the room he had been held and tortured in. Months later John's case was dropped and he was released without charge.
""I just live in fear because I don't really know where to start from or where it is safe to start from or how,"" says John.
Journalist Blaise Eyong exposes the violent realities of the anglophone crisis
People outside the UK can watch here, external
Part of the separatists' strategy to weaken the state and its security forces is to push for a ban on education which they say is a tool of government propaganda.
In October 2020, a school in Kumba was attacked. No-one claimed responsibility for the atrocity but the government blamed separatists. Men armed with machetes and guns killed at least seven children.
The incident sparked, for a brief moment, international outrage and condemnation.
""Nearly half the schools in this region have been shut,"" says journalist Eyong.
""A whole generation of kids is missing out on their education. Imagine the impact this will have for our communities and also for our country.""
John Ewome (R) can be seen patrolling the streets of Buea in anglophone Cameroon looking out for separatists
As if the violence between the government forces and the various separatist groups was not enough, an additional front has opened up in the war. Militant groups in the separatist areas have emerged to fight the Ambazonians in an effort to keep Cameroon united.
A leader of one of these groups, John Ewome (known as Moja Moja), regularly led patrols in the town of Buea in search of separatists until he was arrested in May 2024.
He, too, has been accused of human rights violations, of public humiliation and torturing unarmed civilians thought to be separatist sympathisers. He denies the accusations. ""I've never laid my hands on any civilian. Just the Ambazonians. And I believe the gods of this land are with me,"" he told the BBC.
Meanwhile, the cycle of abductions and killings continue.
Joe (not his real name) was - like Johnson - taken hostage by a separatist group, keen to maintain control through fear - and to cash in.
""I walked into the house, and found my children and my wife on the floor while the commander was sitting in my kitchen with his gun very close. All around me, my neighbour had been taken, my landlord had been taken. So when I saw them, I knew it was my turn,"" says Joe.
He was led into the forest with 15 other people where he witnessed the execution of two of his fellow captives. But he was eventually freed after the military discovered the camp.
Johnson was not as lucky and, about two years after his funeral took place, news arrived that neither were his five colleagues kidnapped with him. Their bodies had just been found.
More families will now have to try to come to terms with their enormous loss. For Ngabi Dora Tue, sitting with her young child in her lap, the future feels almost overwhelming.
""I have debts I have to settle I don't even know how to settle,"" she says.
""I thought of selling my body for money. And then I Iook at the shame that would come after, I just have to swallow the difficulty and then push forward. I was very young to become a widow.""
The BBC has asked for a response from the Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF), which claims to be the largest separatist force.
It responded that there are a multiplicity of separatist fighters now operating in the anglophone region.
The ADF said it operates within international law and does not attack government workers, schools, journalists or civilians.
Instead it has blamed individuals and fringe entities acting on their own accord who are not members of the ADF for these attacks.
The group also accuses government infiltrators of committing atrocities while claiming to be Ambazonian fighters to turn the local populations against the liberation struggle.

122,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c17rw0vy0glo,2025-05-25 23:07:31,"An Indian teacher was killed - then he got falsely labelled a ""terrorist"",","Mohammad Iqbal died on 7 May in cross-border shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir
Farooq Ahmed still bristles with anger when he talks about his brother's death.
Mohammad Iqbal, a resident of Poonch city in Indian-administered Kashmir, died in cross-border shelling on 7 May, the morning after India launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation to a militant attack in the town of Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied having any role in the attack.
Mr Ahmed says that Iqbal died where he had worked for more than two decades - Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa, or a religious centre focused on Islamic teachings, in Poonch.
But his death, it turned out, was just the beginning of the family's troubles. 
As the news spread, several media channels falsely accused Iqbal of being a terrorist, following which the police put out a statement refuting the claim.
""My brother was a teacher but they saw his beard and skullcap and branded him a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.
""It was like having salt rubbed into our wounds. We had lost Iqbal and then the media defamed him. The dead can't defend themselves.""
Indian officials say that a total of 16 people, including Iqbal, were killed in the cross-border shelling during the four-day military conflict that broke out between India and Pakistan following the airstrikes.
Pakistan has claimed 40 civilian deaths, though, it remains unclear how many of these were directly caused by the shelling.
The two nuclear-armed countries have shared a tense relationship for decades, as both administer the Himalayan region of Kashmir in part, but claim it in full.
They have fought three wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 and came back from the brink of another one earlier this month.
Farooq Ahmed, Iqbal's brother, says the family is still reeling with the tragedy 
But as the military conflict escalated, another battle played out on social media - a disinformation war of claims and counterclaims that circulated online and on TV. 
Just like rumours about Iqbal's identity, other misleading and inaccurate information also found its way into some mainstream news channels and websites.
This included claims such as India having destroyed Pakistan's Karachi port, which was later debunked by the Indian government.
Some of the other fabrications were harder to spot, like an AI-generated video of a Pakistan army general claiming that his country had lost two aircraft in combat.
""The scale of misinformation and fact-free assertions being broadcast by the media was shocking,"" says Manisha Pande, managing editor at Newslaundry, an independent news platform.
She notes that while a degree of sensationalism is expected as channels compete for viewership, ""the jingoistic and irresponsible coverage"" of the conflict was unprecedented in its intensity â and unlike anything she had witnessed before.
No one knows this better than Mr Ahmed. 
""I don't know where news channels got the information about my brother from,"" Mr Ahmed says.
""Who did they speak to? What kind of evidence did they have that my brother was a terrorist?"" he asks.
Iqbal's house in Poonch city - he was the sole earner in his family
Weeks later, the family is still reeling from the tragedy.
Mr Ahmed says that on 7 May, his brother left home for the madrassa in the morning as usual, but it was his body that returned home. By noon, they had buried him in a nearby cemetery.
For some time, the family had no idea about the misinformation that was being shared by some news outlets. They were busy performing Iqbal's last rites.
It was only hours later that a relative received a WhatsApp forward - a video clip of a prominent news channel claiming that the Indian army had killed a terrorist, with Iqbal's photo flashing on the screen.
""We were shocked. Soon, we began getting more calls from people asking us what was going on and why was the media calling Iqbal a terrorist,"" Mr Ahmed says.
The claim was shared by some prominent channels, including Zee News, ABP and News18. The BBC has reached out to the channels for comment. 
One channel claimed that Iqbal was killed in an ""Indian strike on a terrorist camp"" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and that he was a terrorist with Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba. 
""Our family members have been staying in Poonch for generations. How can they say my brother was living in Pakistan? They [the media] should be ashamed,"" Mr Ahmed says. 
India launched a series of airstrikes against Pakistan on 7 May
The accusation against Iqbal was circulated so widely and swiftly that on 8 May, the Poonch police put out a statement, clarifying that Iqbal had died in cross-border shelling in the madrasa.
""Poonch Police strongly refutes such false narratives. The deceased, Maulana Mohd Iqbal, was a respected religious figure in the local community and had no affiliation with any terror outfit,"" the statement said, adding that legal action would be taken against any media outlet or individual who circulated the fake news.
But for Mr Ahmed, the statement was too little too late.
""By then, the false claim would've already reached millions of people in India,"" he says. 
He adds that except for one channel, News18, no one else had publicly apologised to him or their viewers for the mistake. 
Mr Ahmed says he wants to take legal action against the channels, but the process would have to wait as the family is struggling to make ends meet. 
Iqbal is survived by his two wives and eight children. He was the only earning member in his family. 
Mr Ahmed says that the compensation given by the government, which amounts to a few million rupees, will last only for a year or two and they must start planning for the future now.
""The whole family depended on my brother. He was a quiet and gentle man who loved teaching children,"" Mr Ahmed says.
""But who's going to tell this to the world? For many people, my brother is still a terrorist whose killing is justified. How will they understand our pain?""

123,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyqq18evyko,2025-05-25 23:04:21,"'We didn't see it as treason': The Russian couple who became informants for Ukraine,","Sergei and Tatyana Voronkov had long been disillusioned with modern Russia when they decided to move to Ukraine
It was shortly after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 that Sergei and Tatyana Voronkov decided they would leave Russia.
The couple, who had long been critical of Vladimir Putin, had condemned the actions of Russia to friends and acquaintances. In response, they were told that if they didn't like it they could leave.
So the couple, both Russian citizens, decided to relocate to Ukraine, where Tatyana was born.
In 2019 they eventually settled in Novolyubymivka, a village of about 300 people in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region.
The couple got four dogs and started raising livestock, while Sergei, 55, also found work as a land surveyor â his specialism during his time in the Soviet army.
They hoped for a quiet life. But when Moscow launched its full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the peace of their new lives was shattered by the first Russian rockets flying over their home.
""I heard something whistling, something flying, and I went outside,"" Tatyana, 52, recalls.
""A rocket was flying right over the house.
""I went on the internet to see what had happened and they wrote that Kyiv had already been bombed.""
The couple quickly found themselves in occupied territory, and decided to become informants for Ukraine.
What followed was detention, interrogation, an escape into Europe â and a letter of thanks from the Ukrainian army.
Sergei and Tatyana in Moscow before they moved to live in Ukraine
It was when a Russian convoy passed their home for the first time that Tatyana decided to act.
She ran inside and messaged an acquaintance in Kyiv, whom she believed had contacts in Ukraine's security services.
The contact sent her a link to a chatbot on messaging app Telegram which told her they would be contacted by a person with a unique identifier.
The couple were then asked to provide the location and details of Russian electronic warfare systems and military hardware they had seen, particularly missile systems and tanks. 
The locations would help the Ukrainian army target and destroy Russian troops in the area with drones and artillery.
""We didn't think of it as treason,"" says Tatyana, who along with Sergei insists the information they gave did not result in any strikes on civilians or civilian infrastructure.
""Nobody attacked Russia. This was a fight against evil.""
For two years, Sergei would collect coordinates and Tatyana would transmit them from her phone - removing all traces of the messages afterwards - as and when their village's internet access allowed them to do so.
But all of this came to an end when Sergei was detained in April 2024 by armed men while he was shopping for gardening seeds in the regional centre of Tokmak.
A Russian military convoy moving towards the Donbas region in February 2022
Sergei says he was taken to an abandoned house and put in a cold basement pit - around two metres wide and three metres deep - where he slept in a squatting position.
The next day he was questioned about whether he had passed details of Russian positions to the Ukrainians. Sergei says a bag was kept over his head during the interrogation and he was threatened with violence.
After initially denying his involvement, Sergei confessed on the fourth day of his captivity, fearing that if he were subjected to violence he might accidently implicate others.
While all of this was happening, Tatyana was desperately searching for information on his whereabouts.
She travelled the area and phoned hospitals and morgues, while the couple's son, who was still living near Moscow, contacted various authorities there. 
Ten days after Sergei's arrest, security forces searched the Voronkovs' home and dug up $4,400 that had been hidden by the couple in their garden.
Shortly after, Tatyana was told that her husband was ""sitting in a basement"" and was with Russia's security services, the FSB.
Weeks later, after 37 days in captivity, Sergei was made to confess to assisting Ukraine on camera by people who introduced themselves to him as FSB.
But to his surprise, he was released two days later, though almost all of his documents, including his passport, were confiscated.
To this day, Sergei and Tatyana do not understand why he was released.
However, the BBC understands this is not uncommon in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia, where investigative and judicial processes lack transparency and often no explanations are given as to why a person is detained or released.
Sergei and his pets at his home in Novolyubymivka
In the weeks after Sergei's release, the couple believe they were kept under surveillance, with cars constantly driving up to their home and strangers asking them if they were selling anything.
Believing they'd never be left alone, the couple began plotting a way to leave.
After consulting human rights activists, Sergei and Tatyana decided to try to travel to Lithuania. But to do that, they needed to return to Russia first to get Sergei a new passport.
Their neighbours in Novolyubymivka helped by buying livestock and household appliances from them. The couple even managed to find a new home for their dogs, which Sergei says was his biggest worry.
The couple set off in their car.
Fearing they could be pulled over and quizzed by Russian forces, they made up a cover story about going to the beach to get fresh air for Tatyana, who has asthma. They even brought a straw hat and a rubber ring to make the story more convincing.
But in the end they weren't stopped.
The couple were initially denied entry into Russia, but were eventually able to enter after Sergei got a certificate proving he had applied for a new passport.
After delays in getting his passport and a thwarted attempt to leave Russia via Belarus, Sergei bought a fake passport through Telegram.
The couple were then able to travel by bus to Belarus and cross the border using Sergei's forged document. From there, they crossed into Lithuania, a member of the European Union and a close ally of Ukraine, though Sergei was detained for holding forged documents.
He was later found guilty of using a fake passport by a Lithuanian court.
Sergei managed to get into Lithuania, a member of EU, using a fake passport, but was later prosecuted by Lithuanian authorities
The couple are now living in a shelter for asylum seekers and hope to settle in Lithuania.
The Ukrainian army sent them a letter of thanks - at the request of their former handler in Kyiv - to support their application for asylum. The BBC has seen a copy of the letter.
The BBC has also seen documents from official bodies in both Russia and Ukraine that confirm what happened to the Voronkovs. We are not reproducing them to protect the identities of those involved.
The Voronkovs' actions have caused deep rifts in the family.
Their son, who remains in Russia, stopped talking to his parents after learning what they had done.â¯ Sergei's mother, who is 87, still lives in Russia and is supportive of the war and President Putin.
But despite this, the couple are adamant they will never return to Russia.
""Only if it starts showing some humanity,"" Sergei says.
""For now, I see nothing human there."""
124,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2rx8kxdm4o,2025-05-25 04:33:36,"Zelensky says 'US silence' over Russian attacks encourages Putin,","Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has alleged that the US's ""silence"" after recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin, following Moscow's largest aerial attack yet.
The overnight attack saw Russia fire 367 drones and missiles - the highest number in a single night since Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022.
At least 12 people, including three children, were killed and dozens more injured in widespread strikes across Ukraine. They came a day after one of the heaviest assaults on the capital Kyiv in months.
US President Donald Trump reacted late on Sunday by telling reporters: ""I'm not happy with what Putin is doing. He's killing a lot of people.""
Ukraine's Air Force said that since 20:40 on Saturday local time (17:40 GMT), Russia had carried out strikes using 298 drones and 69 cruise and ballistic missiles.
The air force said it had shot down 45 cruise missiles and destroyed 266 UAVs, with most regions in Ukraine affected and hits recorded in 22 locations. Rescuers were working in more than 30 cities and villages, Zelensky said.
Despite mounting international calls, Russia has continued to intensify its aerial campaign, showing no sign of halting its offensive and ignoring calls for a ceasefire.
In a pointed message to Trump - who has previously claimed that Putin is interested in ending the war - Zelensky said: ""The world may go on vacation, but the war continues, despite weekends and weekdays.
""This cannot be ignored. America's silence, and the silence of others in the world, only encourages Putin.""
Zelensky warned that Russia's ""brutality cannot be stopped"" without ""strong pressure on the Russian leadership.""
Trump's first comments on the latest strikes came hours later at an airport in Morristown, New Jersey, as he was preparing to return to Washington.
""I'm not happy with Putin. I don't know what's wrong with him. What the hell happened to him?"" Trump said.
He declined to give any details about what his response would be.
Until then, the only reaction to the Russian barrage from senior US officials came from Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine.
In a post on X, he published a photo purportedly showing smoke billowing in the night sky over the Ukrainian capital after the Russian attacks.
""This is Kyiv. The indiscriminate killing of women and children at night in their homes is a clear violation of the 1977 Geneva Peace Protocols designed to protect innocents. These attacks are shameful. Stop the killing. Ceasefire now,"" Kellogg wrote.
The 1977 protocols are amendments to the Geneva Convention, which sets out internationally agreed rules of conduct in war.
Of the people killed, three in the Zhytomyr region to the west of Kyiv were children - all siblings, according to Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa. In a statement on X, she identified them as eight-year-old Stanislav, Tamara, 12, and Roman, 17.
Siblings Stanislav, Tamara, and Roman were all killed in the Russian bombardment, Ukrainian officials said
When Zelensky refers to ""American silence"", he likely means the further sanctions Washington has so far resisted imposing on Moscow for its continued invasion.
His argument is that Russia's war machine is not being starved sufficiently, and that the Kremlin is not being incentivised enough to meaningfully engage in ceasefire talks.
Trump has said he wants to use more of a carrot than stick when it comes to convincing Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, but, aside from direct Ukraine-Russia talks and further prisoner of war exchanges, there has been little to no progress on bringing a pause in fighting closer, despite the US president's growing impatience.
Despite Kyiv's European allies preparing further sanctions for Russia, the US has said it will either continue trying to broker these peace talks, or ""walk away"" if progress does not follow.
With Moscow's continued, maximalist demands for peace, Putin deciding not to show up at recent ceasefire negotiations in Turkey, and 48 hours of heavy aerial bombardments for Ukraine, it is hard to see what the Kremlin would have to do in order for the White House to adopt a tougher stance.
Russia's defence ministry said it had inflicted damage on targets including military airfields, ammunition depots and electric warfare stations, claiming damage across 142 areas.
According to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, 13 regions were attacked, with more than 60 people injured, 80 residential buildings damaged, and 27 fires recorded. 
Klymenko called it a ""combined, ruthless strike aimed at civilians"".
Two women, aged 85 and 56, were killed after a house in Kupiansk was hit, according to Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv region.
In the Kyiv region, four people were killed and 16 injured, including three children, DSNS said.
Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. 
This includes Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.
Russia's previous largest drone attack came just a week ago when 273 drones were launched on the central Kyiv region and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east, according to Ukraine's air force.
Russia is able not only to just manufacture drones at a faster rate, but they are also evolving. Shahed drones are now being packed with more explosives and improved technology to evade detection.
Ukraine said the 13 regions hit by strikes on Sunday were Kyiv and the capital's wider region, as well as the regions of Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Sumy and Poltava.
In Kyiv, local officials reported 11 injuries, multiple fires and damage to residential buildings, including a dormitory. 
A BBC colleague messaged to say a block of flats was destroyed, just a five minute drive from where she lived.
The strikes came as the capital marked its annual Kyiv Day holiday.

In Russia, the defence ministry said 110 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and intercepted over 12 Russian regions and the Crimea peninsula between midnight and 07:00 local time (05:00 BST).
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin reported that 12 drones heading towards the capital were shot down.
He added that emergency services crews were deployed to assess damage caused by falling drone debris.
In the Tula region, just south of Moscow, drone wreckage crashed in the courtyard of a residential building, smashing windows in a number of apartments, local governor Dmitriy Milyaev said.
No-one was injured, he added.
Sunday was also the third and final day of a major prisoner of war exchange between the two sides. After this weekend, there is even less hope it will lead to further co-operation.
On Friday, Ukraine and Russia each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022.
On Saturday, Zelensky announced that another 307 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin.
And on Sunday, Ukraine and Russia each confirmed 303 of their soldiers had returned home - bringing the total over the three days to 1,000 prisoners each.
The swap followed the first face-to-face talks between the two sides in three years, which took place in Turkey. 
Earlier this week, Trump and Putin had a two-hour phone call to discuss a US-proposed Ukraine ceasefire deal.
Trump said he believed the call had gone ""very well"", and added that Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately start"" negotiations toward a ceasefire and ""an end to the war"".
However, Putin has only said Russia would work with Ukraine to craft a ""memorandum"" on a ""possible future peace"", and has not accepted a 30-day ceasefire."

Human remains found at farmland in County Kerry have been identified as being those of missing farmer Michael Gaine.
Mr Gaine, 56, had been missing for more than eight weeks and he was initially treated as a missing persons case before it was upgraded to a homicide.
The confirmation comes nine days after human tissue was discovered in fields on Mr Gaine's farm, near Kenmare.
The discovery led to the farmyard and several fields being sealed off and declared a crime scene.
Since then, the area has been searched by specialist teams, including members of the Garda (Irish police) Technical Bureau, assisted by local garda search teams and the Irish Defence Forces.
A man in his 50s, who was arrested last Sunday on suspicion of Mr Gaine's murder, was later released without charge. 
He has denied any involvement in the farmer's disappearance.
On Sunday evening, gardaÃ­ confirmed the identification of Mr Gaine's remains in a statement.
They have further appealed to the public for assistance in this investigation.
Irish Defence Forces members had assisted with the search
Mr Gaine, a sheep and cattle farmer, was reported missing from his home near Kenmare on 21 March. 
He was last seen in the County Kerry town the previous day.
He lived in the remote Carrig East area, close the Molls Gap beauty spot, along the renowned Ring of Kerry.
Last month, Michael Gaine's wife Janice told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he ""loved his home, he loved his farm, he loved animals"" adding that his disappearance was ""totally out of character"".
According to RTÃ, in-depth investigations by gardaÃ­ ruled out ""innocent"" explanations, such as a medical event, an accident, or that he left the area voluntarily. 
A missing person's investigation operates on the basis of consent, but when gardaÃ­ announced the re-classification of their investigation, it meant the range of options in front of the investigation team significantly increased.
They could then get search warrants, clear areas of interest and seize and examine certain items like phones and laptops."

Iran summoned France's envoy in Tehran to protest against ""insulting"" remarks made by the French foreign minister after an Iranian filmmaker won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.
Iranian director Jafar Panahi won the prestigious Palme d'Or for his film It Was Just an Accident on Saturday, a political drama inspired by his time in prison.
Following the win, French foreign minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot said Panahi's win was ""a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression"".
This sparked a diplomatic row, with Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammad Tanhaei calling the comments ""insulting remarks and unfounded allegations"", state media reported. 
During the meeting with the French envoy, Tanhaei called Barrot's comments ""blatant interference"" in the country's internal affairs, according to the same report from Iran's PressTV.
He described the congratulatory message as ""irresponsible and provocative"", adding that France had ""no moral authority at all"" to comment on Iran, citing what he called France's failure to support Palestinians in Gaza. 
He demanded an official explanation from the French government, and the envoy said he would relay the message to Paris.
Panahi has been in and out of prison in recent years for his outspoken criticism of the Iranian establishment.
He spent seven months of a six-year sentence in jail before being released in February 2023. 
He had previously been sentenced to six years in 2010 for supporting anti-government protests and creating ""propaganda against the system"", serving two months on that occasion.
As well as his jail terms, he was given a 20-year ban on making movies and travelling outside his own country.
Despite this, he filmed It Was Just An Accident, in secret in Iran. 
The film follows five ordinary Iranians as they confront a man they believe tortured them in jail - characters drawn from conversations Panahi had with fellow inmates about ""the violence and brutality of the Iranian government"".
During his acceptance speech, he urged fellow Iranians to ""join forces"". 
""No-one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do, or what we should not do.""
Soon after the ceremony, his first appearance at an international film festival in 15 years, he told reporters he would be returning to Tehran.
""As soon as I finish my work here I will go back to Iran,"" he told reporters in Cannes. ""And I will ask myself what's my next film going to be."""

A dual US-German citizen has been deported from Israel to the US after allegedly trying to burn down the US embassy in Tel Aviv, American officials say.
Joseph Neumayer, 28, was first arrested in Israel after his backpack, which allegedly contained explosive devices, was found near the embassy. After being sent to the US, he was met on Sunday by officials at New York's John F Kennedy Airport.
He appeared in court the same day and was being held in jail, the US justice department said. 
""This defendant is charged with planning a devastating attack targeting our embassy in Israel, threatening death to Americans, and President Trump's life,"" said Attorney General Pam Bondi.
US officials say Mr Neumayer arrived in Israel in April and on 19 May headed to the US embassy in Tel Aviv with a dark-coloured backpack. 
The 28-year-old spat on an embassy guard as he walked by, the officials said. When the guard tried to detain him, Mr Neumayer allegedly ran away and left behind a backpack with three Molotov cocktails - which are small bombs made with flammable liquids that are meant to start fires once they are lit and thrown.
Israeli police later found Mr Neumeyer at his hotel where he was arrested, the US justice department said. 
He had earlier allegedly posted on his social media account pledging to ""burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv"", and calling for ""death to America, death to Americans"".
Officials said Mr Neumeyer also threatened to assassinate Trump in social media posts on another account believed to be connected to him.
He was sent back on Sunday to the US, where he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted. 
News of Mr Neumeyer's reportation comes just days after a gunman killed two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington DC.  
Last Wednesday, a young couple, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were shot dead outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. 
Police identified the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, who they say shouted ""free Palestine"" after he shot the pair.

The bodies of five skiers have been found by rescuers near Switzerland's luxury Zermatt resort.
They were recovered a day after emergency services were alerted by a group of climbers ascending the Rimpfischhorn - a 4,199-metre peak in the Valais Alps - to several pairs of skis left unattended near the summit.
Aerial and ground searches led to the discovery of the bodies below the summit on the Adler Glacier, Valais local police said in a statement on Sunday.
The victims were found at varying altitudes on avalanche debris in high altitude areas near the Swiss-Italian border.
Three bodies were located in one area and two more were discovered higher up on a narrow patch of snow, rescue service Air Zermatt said.
A fifth pair of skis was later found during the search, confirming that the group had travelled as a party of five. Their identities have not yet been formally released.
The public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the accident.
Zermatt is one of Switzerland's more premium Alpine resorts, visited by affluent British and other European skiers. But the climb to Rimpfischhorn is considered a more advanced expedition, around five hours from the resort. 
There are a number of approaches to the climb, all of them requiring an overnight in a high hut. From Zermatt the usual way is to take lifts to Blauherd at 2570 meters.
In a separate incident on Friday night, Air Zermatt was also involved in a challenging mountain rescue on the FiescherhÃ¶rner, where four alpinists were stranded amid fog and high winds.
The initial evacuation attempt had to be aborted due to the weather, but a second attempt just after midnight brought all four to safety."

At least 45,000 homes were affected after the blaze broke out at around 02:00 local time (01:00 BST) on Sunday, a day after nearby Cannes suffered a massive blackout that was blamed on suspected sabotage.
Police in Nice say ""tyre tracks"" were found and the door to the substation, in the west of the city, was ""broken"", according to local media reports.
Nice Airport, the tramway network, and neighbouring towns of Saint-Laurent-du-Var and Cagnes-sur-Mer, were impacted before power was restored later in the morning.
Nice's mayor Christian Estrosi said on X that he ""strongly denounced"" the ""malicious acts that affect our country"". 
The city's deputy mayor, GaÃ«l Nofri, said the substation fire was ""probably of criminal origin"". 
It came a day after Cannes suffered a major blackout during the international film festival. Officials said it may have been caused by an arson attack on a substation. 
Around 160,000 homes in the city and surrounding areas lost power.
Several screenings were interrupted by the power cut in the morning, before festival organisers were able to switch to private generators.
At the moment, no link has been established between the two incidents. 
Estrosi said authorities would reinforce the security network around the Nice's electric sites. An investigation into ""organised arson"" has been opened.
Nice prosecutor Damien Martinelli was quoted by AFP news agency as saying investigations were underway, in particular ""to clarify the damage and the manner in which the act was committed""."

""When I heard the attack happened, the ground fell from beneath my feet. All the parents started running towards the bus, no-one could understand what was going on,"" Nasir Mehmood, a sergeant in Pakistan's army tells us.
Nasir and I are in the city of Quetta, sitting in the waiting room of the largest military hospital in the province of Balochistan.  His 14-year-old son Mohammad Ahmad told him he was flung across the army school bus in a bombing in Khuzdar, a few hours' drive away.
The bus was carrying around 40 schoolchildren when it exploded at about 07:40 local time (02:40 GMT) on Wednesday.
Nasir Mehmood, whose son was injured in the attack on an army school bus in Khuzdar
""I reached the hospital, and there were screams of children everywhere, it was the only thing you could hear,"" Nasir said. ""My eyes just kept searching for my son.""
Only the most serious cases were airlifted to the Combined Military Hospital. The military have said the death toll has now risen to eight, with six children killed and dozens injured. No group has admitted carrying out the attack.
It is rare for foreign journalists to be allowed to enter the province, south-west of Pakistan, let alone a hospital on the army's compound. The military said they wanted international media to witness the impact of the attack themselves.
Pakistan alleges India is linked to the attack, though there is no independent evidence - and it is a claim Delhi firmly denies.
India and Pakistan are in the midst of a fragile ceasefire, after a two-week conflict that was their most significant one in decades. It saw them exchange drone attacks, missiles and artillery fire, and left dozens of casualties. 
This attack in Balochistan is now in the middle of the tensions, with news channels broadcasting pictures of the children who were killed, most of them girls between the ages of 12 and 16, alongside accusations of an ""Indian terror campaign"". Images of scrapped metal, children's shoes and abandoned backpacks strewn along the scene highlight the tragedy.

As we walked through the intensive care unit, some children lay unconscious on their beds, others thrashed in pain. One young girl kept calling out for her mother as nurses tried to calm her. Doctors told us several children were in critical condition, having suffered extensive trauma, burns and fractured bones. The night before we arrived, another child had died. 
Pakistan's Minister of Information, Attaullah Tarar, says there is a history of Indian proxies operating in Balochistan. In turn, India says that Pakistan has been harbouring militants who wage attacks on Indian-administered Kashmir for years. 
The killing of 26 people in April, most of them tourists in Pahalgam, sparked the most recent conflict. Pakistan has called for an open investigation led by an independent party.
However, Tarar denied that such an investigation was necessary in Balochistan.
""Pahalgam was a one-off incident,"" he told us. ""We are the victims in this case. We have been suffering. There is a history. We have evidence. So what can I say?""
When we asked him what that evidence was, he once again pointed to claims of a history of attacks.  He gave us no other details of India's alleged involvement in this attack.

Later, an officer drove us through Quetta's roads in a bus flanked by soldiers carrying rifles and ammunition hanging from their pockets.
Balochistan has experienced decades of militant attacks linked to a nationalist insurgency. It is home to several groups which accuse the government of exploiting its natural resources.
In March, some 21 people, most of them off-duty security personnel, were killed during a train siege in Balochistan's remote Sibi district.
That attack was carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). 
Pakistan, as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation.
As the military responds to the insurgency, activists in Balochistan accuse Pakistan's security forces of human rights violations. They say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared in the last two decades, and are allegedly detained without due legal process.
The minister of information told us the government believed ""faceless courts"" might be needed in the province, hiding the identities of the judges and prosecutors in terror cases. Tarar said the courts often fail to convict the accused, because of a fear of retribution from militant groups.
In a press conference, the military spokesperson, Lt Gen Chaudhry, said the school bus attack  ""had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India's provocation"".
The government says it is raising the issue ""across diplomatic channels"" around the world. 
The impact on the ceasefire and on the prospect of talks between India and Pakistan remains to be seen.

A British fishing vessel has been impounded by the French authorities, accused of illegally fishing in their waters.
It was seized in the English Channel and is being held at the port of Boulogne, unable to leave while the French authorities consider bringing a prosecution.
The vessel was stopped at sea by the French Navy on Thursday night, with its crew alleged to have been fishing in French waters without a licence.
The incident comes days after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was criticised by British fishermen over his reset deal with the European Union, which gives EU fishing vessels access to UK waters for 12 more years.
The Foreign Office said it was offering support to a British national in France and was in touch with local authorities.
""As the vessel remains subject to an ongoing investigation by French fisheries authorities, we are unable to comment further at this time,"" a government spokesperson added.
According to the French Coastguard, the navy patrol vessel Pluvier was conducting inspections in their waters overnight on 23 May, finding the British vessel to have been allegedly operating without a licence.
The fishing vessel was diverted to Boulogne ""for the purpose of initiating prosecution"".
The Conservatives accused the French authorities of ""shameful double standards"" over the arrest.
Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said they had failed to stop thousands of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats, accusing France of ""taking no action whatsoever at sea and often ushering the illegal immigrants into UK waters"".
""Yet when a UK fishing vessel is in French waters all of a sudden they are magically able to act. If the French can now intercept boats then they should start stopping the boats with illegal immigrants - as international law obliges them to do.""
The UK and the EU have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation.
A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions.
Critics from the Conservatives and Reform UK described the deal as a ""surrender"" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some ""positive first steps"" to rebuilding ties with Europe."

As a footballer, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas seemed destined for greatness. But a drug-smuggling conviction has left his career and reputation in tatters. How did things unravel so dramatically for a player once tipped for the top?
Hailed by legendary Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger as a footballer who could ""play anywhere"", Emmanuel-Thomas was marked out early on as having elite potential.
Imposing, technically gifted and surprisingly agile, the striker appeared to have the world at his feet.
But a career that promised so much at Arsenal faltered and saw him spend years  flitting between the second and third tiers of English football.
In 2020 he moved to play in Scotland and was still plying his trade north of the border when, on 18 September, he was arrested at his home in Gourock, near Glasgow.
Sixteen days earlier, Border Force officers had stopped two women at London Stansted Airport and found drugs in their cases.
It was not a minor haul; they were staring at cannabis with a street value of Â£600,000.
How did it get there? The evidence soon led detectives to Emmanuel-Thomas.
Emmanuel-Thomas (centre) captained Arsenal to FA Youth Cup victory, aged 16. His team-mates included future England star Jack Wilshere (left)
Wind back a decade and a half, and things were very different.
It is 26 May 2009, and Arsenal's latest batch of academy talents can barely contain their excitement.
The young prospects, including Jack Wilshere and Francis Coquelin, have just won the FA Youth Cup.
One player in particular has stood out: their 16-year-old captain, Emmanuel-Thomas, who has scored in every round of the competition.
""These young men have a very bright future indeed,"" remarked one commentator, external.
But despite going on to make five first-team appearances, it was not quite to be for Emmanuel-Thomas.
Emmanuel-Thomas, pictured at the back with his tongue out, was caught after a ""very thorough investigation"" by the NCA
He was shipped out on several loans before leaving the north London club for Ipswich Town.
It was a move that excited supporters in Suffolk, who were keen to see what the former Arsenal starlet could produce.
However, 71 games and eight goals later, Emmanuel-Thomas had not quite made the mark fans hoped for, and he moved to Bristol City in a player exchange deal.
Emmanuel-Thomas's spell at Ipswich did not live up to fans' hopes
The striker was a prolific scorer in his first season at Bristol City
Here, he helped the Robins secure promotion to the Championship and became something of a cult hero, scoring 21 goals in his first season.
A move to Queens Park Rangers followed, with subsequent loan spells at MK Dons and Gillingham.
A spell at MK Dons was another step in Emmanuel-Thomas's career
But in 2019, Emmanuel-Thomas accepted a transfer to a Thai-based team that would alter the course of his life.
It is believed he was tempted into the country's drugs underworld while playing for PTT Rayong, a club that folded in the same year.
Despite later moves to an Indian side and several Scottish outfits, including Aberdeen, Emmanuel-Thomas never shook off the criminal connections he made.
By the time he took a six-month contract at Greenock Morton, a 40-minute drive from Glasgow, the game was almost up.
The drugs were intercepted by Border Force officers at London Stansted Airport in Essex
As he lined up for them against Queens Park on 14 September, he would have surely known the law was about to catch up with him.
The women arrested at Stansted were his 33-year-old girlfriend, Yasmin Piotrowska, and her friend Rosie Rowland, 28.
Emmanuel Thomas, by then 33, appeared in court charged with orchestrating the attempted importation of drugs, and was sacked by his club.
Detectives discovered he had duped Ms Piotrowska, from north-west London, and Ms Rowland, from Chelmsford, into travelling to Thailand with the promise of Â£2,500 in cash and an all-expenses-paid trip.
Their job? To bring home two suitcases each, filled with what they were assured was gold, Chelmsford Crown Court heard.
They flew business class from Bangkok, landing in Essex via Dubai.
Unknown to them, they were smuggling in cannabis with a street value of Â£600,000, vacuum-packed inside the four cases.
The pair were stopped and arrested by Border Force officers, before being charged with drug importation offences.
With the pair in custody, and Emmanuel-Thomas later remanded, police probed how the drugs made it to the UK.
They soon found the player was the intermediary between suppliers in Thailand and dealers in the UK, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA).
With the footballer's encouragement, the women had also made a near-identical trip in July, having been made similar promises of cash and a lavish holiday.
On his way to custody, Emmanuel-Thomas even told NCA officers: ""I just feel sorry for the girls.""
Emmanuel-Thomas changed his plea to guilty
His first court hearing in September was told he carried out ""extensive research"" into flights and directions, including which airports the women had been going to.
David Philips, a senior NCA investigator, said ""organised criminals like Emmanuel-Thomas"" used persuasion and payment to get people to do their dirty work.
""But the risk of getting caught is very high and it simply isn't worth it,"" he added.
During several court appearances, Emmanuel-Thomas, of Cardwell Road, Gourock, strenuously denied attempting to import cannabis.
However, he changed his plea to guilty at the start of May and restrictions on reporting this were lifted on Wednesday.
Charges against both Ms Piotrowska and Ms Rowland were dropped after the prosecution revealed they had been tricked by Emmanuel-Thomas.
It followed what David Josse KC described as a ""very thorough investigation"".
Emmanuel-Thomas appeared via video link from HMP Chelmsford at his latest court hearing.
When he returns to court for sentencing, on a date still to be confirmed, it will not be his first time in the spotlight.
But it will be for very different reasons to the day he lifted that trophy aloft in 2009.

Founded in 1600 as a trading enterprise, the English East India Company gradually transformed into a colonial power. 
By the late 18th Century, as it tightened its grip on India, Company officials began commissioning Indian artists - many formerly employed by the Mughals - to create striking visual records of the land they were now ruling.
A Treasury of Life: Indian Company Paintings, c. 1790 to 1835, an ongoing show in the Indian capital put together by DAG, an art gallery in Delhi, features over 200 works that once lay on the margins of mainstream art history. It is India's largest exhibition of Company paintings, highlighting their rich diversity and the skill of Indian artists.
Painted by largely unnamed artists, these paintings covered a wide range of subjects, but mainly fall into three categories: natural history, like botanical studies; architecture, including monuments and scenic views of towns and landscapes; and Indian manners and customs.
""The focus on these three subject areas reflects European engagements with their Indian environment in an attempt to come to terms with all that was unfamiliar to Western eyes,"" says Giles Tillotson of DAG, who curated the show.
""Europeans living in India were delighted to encounter flora and fauna that were new to them,  and ancient buildings in exotic styles. They met â or at least observed â multitudes of people whose dress and habits were strange but â as they began to discern â were linked to stream of religious belief and social practice.""
Sita Ram painted the dargah of Sheikh Salim Chishti, Fatehpur Sikri, 1815-25
Beyond natural history, India's architectural heritage captivated European visitors. 
Before photography, paintings were the best way to document travels, and iconic Mughal monuments became prime subjects. Patrons soon turned to skilled local artists.
Beyond the Taj Mahal, popular subjects included Agra Fort, Jama Masjid, Buland Darwaza, Sheikh Salim Chishti's tomb at Fatehpur Sikri (above), and Delhi's Qutub Minar and Humayun's Tomb.
The once-obscure and long-anonymous Indian artist Sita Ram, who painted the tomb, was one of them. 
From June 1814 to early October 1815, Sita Ram travelled extensively with Francis Rawdon, also known as the Marquess of Hastings, who had been appointed as the governor general in India in 1813 and held the position for a decade. (He is not to be confused with Warren Hastings, who served as India's first governor general much earlier.)
The largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad in West Bengal
The largest group in this collection is a set of botanical watercolours, likely from Murshidabad or Maidapur (in present-day West Bengal). 
While Murshidabad was the Nawab of Bengal's capital, the East India Company operated there. In the late 18th century, nearby Maidapur briefly served as a British base before Calcutta's (now Kolkata) rise eclipsed it.
Originally part of the Louisa Parlby Album - named after the British woman who compiled it while her husband, Colonel James Parlby, served in Bengal - the works likely date to the late 18th Century, before Louisa's return to Britain in 1801.
""The plants represented in the paintings are likely quite illustrative of what could be found growing in both the well-appointed gardens as well as the more marginal spaces of common greens, waysides and fields in the Murshidabad area during the late eighteenth century,"" writes Nicolas Roth of Harvard University. 
""These are familiar plants, domestic and domesticated, which helped constitute local life worlds and systems of meaning, even as European patrons may have seen them mainly as exotica to be collected.""
A 1800 water colour of an elaborate temple ritual in southern India
Another painting from the collection is of a temple procession showing a Shiva statue on an ornate platform carried by men, flanked by Brahmins and trumpeters. 
At the front, dancers with sticks perform under a temporary gateway, while holy water is poured on them from above. 
Labeled Ouricaty Tirounal, it depicts a ritual from Thirunallar temple in Karaikal in southern India, capturing a rare moment from a 200-year-old tradition.

By the late 18th Century, Company paintings had become true collaborations between European patrons and Indian artists. 
Art historian Mildred Archer called them a ""fascinating record of Indian social life,"" blending the fine detail of Mughal miniatures with European realism and perspective. 
Regional styles added richness - Tanjore artists, for example, depicted people of various castes, shown with tools of their trade. These albums captured a range of professions - nautch girls, judges, sepoys, toddy tappers, and snake charmers.
""They catered to British curiosity while satisfying European audience's fascination with the 'exoticism' of Indian life,"" says Kanupriya Sharma of DAG.
Ten men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf, 1800
Most studies of Company painting focus on British patronage, but in south India, the French were commissioning Indian artists as early as 1727. 
A striking example is a set of 48 paintings from Pondicherry - uniform in size and style - showing the kind of work French collectors sought by 1800.
One painting (above) shows 10 men in hats and loincloths rowing through surf. A French caption calls them nageurs (swimmers) and the boat a chilingue.
Among the standout images are two vivid scenes by an artist known as B, depicting  boatmen navigating the rough Coromandel coast in stitched-plank rowboats.
With no safe harbours near Madras or Pondicherry, these skilled oarsmen were vital to European trade, ferrying goods and people through dangerous surf between anchored ships and the shore.
Unidentified artist, A Sloth and a Jackal, watercolour and ink on paper, 1821
Company paintings often featured natural history studies, portraying birds, animals, and plants - especially from private menageries. 
As seen in the DAG show, these subjects are typically shown life-size against plain white backgrounds, with minimal surroundings - just the occasional patch of grass. The focus remains firmly on the species itself.
Ashish Anand, CEO of DAG, says the the latest show proposes Company paintings as the ""starting point of Indian modernism"".
Anand says this ""was the moment when Indian artists who had trained in courtly ateliers first moved outside the court (and the temple) to work for new patrons"". 
""The agendas of those patrons were not tied up with courtly or religious concerns; they were founded on scientific enquiry and observation,"" he says. 
""Never mind that the patrons were foreigners. What should strike us now is how Indian artists responded to their demands, creating entirely new templates of Indian art."""

North Korea has detained three shipyard officials over an accident during the launch of a new warship on Wednesday, state media say.
Parts of the 5,000-tonne destroyer's bottom were crushed during the launch ceremony, tipping the vessel off balance.
An investigation into the incident, which North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un described as a ""criminal act"", is ongoing.
KCNA, North Korea's official news agency, identified those detained as the chief engineer of the northern Chongjin shipyard where the destroyer was built, as well as the construction head and an administrative manager.
The report said that the three were ""responsible for the accident"".
On Friday, KCNA said the manager of the shipyard, Hong Kil Ho, had been summoned by law enforcers.
Satellite images showed the vessel lying on its side covered by large blue tarpaulins, and a portion of the vessel appeared to be on land.
North Korea's state media did not mention any casualties or injuries at the time, downplaying the damage. 
KCNA reported that there were no holes on the ship's bottom - contrary to initial reports.
""The hull starboard was scratched and a certain amount of seawater flowed into the stern section,"" the agency said.
Kim said on Thursday the accident was caused by ""absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism"".
He added that those who made ""irresponsible errors"" would be dealt with at a plenary meeting next month.
It is not clear what punishment they might face, but the authoritarian state has a woeful human rights record.
It is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents - though it has done this a handful of times in the past.
This particular accident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a similar 5,000-tonne destroyer, the Choe Hyon.
Kim had called that warship a ""breakthrough"" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year."
135,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04erp9gxkyo,2025-05-24 23:32:08,"King's invitation to Canada sends a message to Trump - and the world,","A decade ago, a portrait of the monarch caused a row in Canadian politics. Now, the King is being invited to deliver the ceremonial Speech from the Throne in Ottawa. So, what has changed?
In 2011, shortly after forming a majority Conservative government, Prime Minister Stephen Harper caused a national uproar when he sought to emphasise the role of the monarchy in Canada. In one example, he replaced two artworks by a Quebec painter with a portrait of the Queen.
Some rebuked the gesture as being out of touch with modern times. Canada has, throughout much of its 157-year-old history, sought increasing independence from the Crown, while remaining a part of the Commonwealth.
When Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau succeeded Harper four years later, the Queen's portrait came down, and the Quebec paintings went back up.
Fast forward to 2025, and a paradoxical shift has occurred in Canada's relationship with the Crown. 
In a transparent show of Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Mark Carney - a Liberal - has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament.
King Charles uses symbols to show support for Canada
The strategy behind Carney's invite to the King
The move was ""a huge affirmation and statement about the uniqueness of Canada and its traditions,"" Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian, told the BBC. 
It was ""a theatrical display that is meant to show what makes Canadians separate from Americans"" and not, as Trump has often repeated, a ""51st state"", Mr Vovk said.
Both countries are former British colonies, but America's founding fathers took a different path and severed all formal connections to the Crown nearly 250 years ago.
Canada's separation from the UK-based monarchy has been more gradual, and its ties have never been completely broken. 
Canada's parliamentary system is modelled after Britain's Westminster system. The monarch is still the head of state of Canada - as well as other Commonwealth countries - even though their duties are often carried out by their Canadian representative, called the governor general.
Loyalty to the Crown was seen as important to Canada's politicians in the 19th Century who wanted to maintain separation from the US, said Canadian royal historian and commentator Carolyn Harris.
That later changed in the 1960s, as Quebec - Canada's majority French-speaking province - began to assert its own distinct identity and threatened separation. This led to an era of politicians like Lester B Pearson and Pierre Elliott Trudeau who worked to untangle Canada from its British colonial past. 
In 1982, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau repatriated Canada's constitution, giving full legislative power to the federal government and the provinces, and removing it from British parliament, which until then had retained limited powers.
Ms Harris noted that Canada remained a constitutional monarchy throughout these periods. What fluctuated, however, was how much the prime minister of the day chooses to embrace that connection.
Pierre Trudeau and Queen Elizabeth II signed an act in 1982 that gave Canada full control of its own constitution
Carney's invitation to King Charles III signals that his government will be one that is much more supportive of the Crown, Mr Vovk said, marking ""a very different tone"" from previous Liberals.
The monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977, and has not opened a brand new session of parliament since 1957, making the King's upcoming visit a truly rare occasion.
It comes at a consequential time for Canada.
Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump, after the US president spent months undermining Canada's sovereignty by saying it would be better off as a US state.
Trump also imposed a series of tariffs that have threatened Canada's economic stability, given that the US is its largest trade partner by far.
When announcing the visit last month, Carney called it ""a historic honour that matches the weight of our times"".
He added that the King's visit ""clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country"".
Both historians, Mr Vovk and Ms Harris, noted that the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the monarchy. Some are even critical of it.
The coronation of King Charles III in 2023 made way for fresh scrutiny of the Crown's historic mistreatment of indigenous people in Canada, and questions on whether the new monarch will move towards reconciliation.
Quebec politicians are also still calling for Canada to cut ties with the monarchy. On Friday, the separatist Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois party said it will again seek to scrap the need for elected officials to swear allegiance to the King.
Some Canadians will be intrigued by the pomp and pageantry of the King's visit, Mr Vovk said, but its chief purpose is to send a political message from Canada to the world.
It is also a way for Prime Minister Carney to improve the relationship with Trump, who is famously a fan of the monarchy and its history.
""Strengthening the relationship with the monarchy puts a stamp on legitimacy that transcends individual parties and the current political climate,"" Mr Vovk said. ""Politicians come and go, but the monarchy has always remained.""
It also works to tie Canada closer to Europe - a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England, who has spoken about the need for Canada to find new allies as it navigates its changing relationship with the US.
The visit is notable for the Crown, too.
It will be the King's first to Canada as reigning monarch. He and the Queen had intended to visit last year, but cancelled their plans due to his cancer diagnosis.
The palace has promised a throne speech that will ""mark a significant moment between the head of state and the Canadian people"".
And while it will be a short trip - the King and Queen will arrive Monday morning and depart Tuesday evening - the palace said they hope the trip will be ""an impactful one""."

A man slept outside in a car park overnight in Kenya with his wife and infant son in January, consumed by confusion and disbelief.
The family, refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, had been expecting a flight to the US for resettlement in just hours' time.
But after US President Donald Trump suspended the US refugee programme just two days before the family's scheduled departure, the man was told their flight to America was abruptly cancelled â less than 24 hours before take-off.
""I didn't have anywhere else to go,"" the man, who asked to go by the name of Pacito to protect his identity, told the BBC.
He had already moved his family from their home, sold his furniture and most of their belongings, and prepared for a new life in America. They remain in Kenya, which is a safer prospect than the DR Congo, where they fled conflict.
They represent just three of the roughly 120,000 refugees who had been conditionally approved to enter the US, but who now wait in limbo due to the refugee pause.
Trump's move signalled a major change in the approach that was followed by successive US leaders. Under former President Joe Biden, over 100,000 refugees came to the US in 2024 - the highest annual figure in nearly three decades.
Since entering office in January, Trump has moved quickly to deliver on his campaign promise of an ""America first"" agenda that has involved dramatically restricting routes by which migrants can come to the US.
The effort has also included an ambitious deportation programme under which people have been deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador against a judge's orders, as well as revoking visas from over a thousand university students, and offering illegal immigrants a sum of $1,000 each to ""self-deport"". 
The White House has defended its actions by suggesting that many of those being forced from the country are either violent criminals or threaten America's interests.
But exceptions to the policies have been made for a select few.
""I didn't come here for fun"": Afrikaner defends refugee status in US
The president signed an executive order in February that opened the refugee pathway exclusively to Afrikaners - white South Africans who he claimed were victims of ""racial discrimination"".
A plane carrying 59 of them landed at an airport just outside Washington DC earlier this month, in a ceremonious greeting that included the deputy secretary of state.
""It's not fair,"" Pacito commented. ""There are 120,000 refugees who went through the whole process, the vetting, the security, the medical screenings. We've waited for years, but now these (Afrikaners) are just processed in like three months.""
The situation has left Pacito feeling stuck. Since he has sold all of the equipment that he needed to work in his field of music production, for the past few months he has struggled to find odd jobs to earn money for his family. ""It's kind of hard,"" he said. 
Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted'
Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?
'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in US
Trump has further justified his decision to accept Afrikaners as refugees in the US because he says they face ""a genocide"" - a message that has been echoed by Elon Musk, his South African-born close ally.
Such claims have circulated for years, though are widely discredited, and have been denied by South Africa.
However, the call has taken on new animus â particularly among right-wing groups in the US â ever since a law was passed in South Africa in January that allowed the government to seize land from white landowners ""when it is just and equitable and in the public interest"". The post-apartheid-era law was meant to address frustrations around South Africa's disproportionate land ownership; the country's white population is roughly 7% but owns roughly 72% of farmland.
Though South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said no land has been taken under the new law, days after it was passed, Trump ordered the US to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the country. A diplomatic feud followed.
The fraying relationship was laid bare on Wednesday during a tense White House meeting between the pair. Trump ambushed Ramaphosa on live TV with claims of white ""persecution"" - an allegation Ramaphosa emphatically rejected.
Watch moment Trump confronts South Africa's president with video
Analysts have described the broader foreign policy of Trump's second term as isolationist, with numerous moves made to cut foreign aid and to disentangle the US from foreign conflicts, in addition to reducing immigration.
Trump has also terminated tens of billions of dollars in global aid contracts - including funds that supported lifesaving HIV/Aids programmes in South Africa. He has justified the cuts by saying his team identified fraud within the aid spending.
The moves appear in stark contrast to the White House's decision to fast-track the arrival of white South Africans - a fact that has been critiqued by refugee advocacy groups.
""Every case of protection should be based on credible evidence of persecution, and the central question here is about fairness and equal treatment under the law,"" Timothy Young from the non-profit organisation Global Refuge told the BBC.
""So if one group can access humanitarian pathways, then so should Afghan allies, persecuted religious minorities and the thousands of other families who face serious threats and who meet the legal criteria for refugee status,"" Mr Young said.

Trump to end protected status for Afghans
Among its other moves, the Trump administration has chosen not to renew the temporary protected status for Afghans in the US, saying ""Afghanistan has had an improved security situation"" and a ""stabilising economy"". They now face deportation.
South Africa does not release crime figures based on race, but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. 
Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, usually white, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who were likely to have been black.
Meanwhile, in DR Congo, thousands of civilians have been killed by armed militias in recent years, and nearly 100,000 more displaced, according to UN figures.
Pacito fled DR Congo on foot in 2016, recalling ""guns everywhere I looked"" at the time, and ""no peace"". He said family members of his wife had been killed.
Among the others who see the US as an increasingly unlikely place to resettle as refugees is the Hammad family, who are from Gaza but are now living in Egypt.
""After what happened with Trump, I think it will be impossible,"" Amjad Hammad told the BBC.
He and his family had applied for the US's green card lottery in 2024 but found out in May they had been denied.
He expressed confusion about Trump's concern for the plight of white South Africans over and above other groups.
""What are the Palestinians facing, if the people in South Africa are facing a genocide?"" he asked.
More than 53,000 people have been killed across Gaza since 7 October 2023, when Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - the Palestinian armed group that launched a cross-border attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
The confusion voiced by Mr Hammad is similar to the views of Pacito, whose hopes of resettling in the US were dashed in January.
Since then, he has been left effectively homeless in Nairobi, drifting from place to place to wherever someone will accept him and his family for a few days.
""Sometimes we get food. Sometimes we don't,"" he said. ""We've been struggling very badly.""
The policy changes on the US side give him little hope that he will be accepted by Trump, but the alternative of heading back across Africa to his home country is unimaginable. ""I can't go back,"" he said."

It was supposed to be a defining, catalytic moment for French society.
Horrific, but unmissable. Unignorable.
The seaside town of Vannes, in southern Brittany, had carefully prepared a special venue and a separate overflow amphitheatre for the occasion. 
Hundreds of journalists were accredited for a process that would, surely, dominate headlines in France throughout its three-month duration and force a queasy public to confront a crime too often shunted to the sidelines.
Warning: Some of the details of this story are disturbing
Comparisons were quickly made with - and expectations tied to - last year's Pelicot mass rape trial in southern France and the massive global attention it garnered.
Instead, the trial of France's most prolific known paedophile, Joel Le Scouarnec - a retired surgeon who has admitted in court to raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of them children - is coming to an end this Wednesday amid widespread frustration.
""I'm exhausted. I'm angry. Right now, I don't have much hope. Society seems totally indifferent. It's frightening to think [the rapes] could happen again,"" one of Le Scouarnec's victims, Manon Lemoine, 36, told the BBC.
Retired surgeon Le Scouarnec has admitted almost 300 allegations of rape and abuse
Ms Lemoine and some 50 other victims, stung by an apparent lack of public interest in the trial, have formed their own campaign group to pressure the French authorities, accusing the government of ignoring a ""landmark"" case which exposed a ""true laboratory of institutional failures"".
The group has questioned why a parliamentary commission has not been set up, as in other high-profile abuse cases, and spoken of being made to feel ""invisible"", as if ""the sheer number of victims prevented us from being recognised.""
Some of the victims, most of whom had initially chosen to testify anonymously, have now decided to reveal their identities in public â even posing for photos on the courthouse steps â in the hope of jolting France into paying more attention and, perhaps, learning lessons about a culture of deference that helped a prestigious surgeon to rape with impunity for decades. 
The crimes for which Le Scouarnec is on trial all occurred between 1998 and 2014.
""It's not normal that I should have to show my face. [But] I hope that what we're doing now will change things. That's why we decided to rise up, to make our voices heard,"" said Ms Lemoine.
So, what has gone wrong?
Were the horrors too extreme, the subject matter too unremittingly grim or simply too uncomfortable to contemplate? 
Why, when the whole world knows the name of Dominique and GisÃ¨le Pelicot, has a trial with significantly more victims - child victims abused under the noses of the French medical establishment - passed by with what feels like little more than a collective shudder?
GisÃ¨le Pelicot (C) became a single recognisable figure in her ex-husband's trial
Why does the world not know the name Joel Le Scouarnec?
""The Le Scouarnec case is not mobilising a lot of people. Perhaps because of the number of victims. We hear the disappointment, the lack of wide mobilisation, which is a pity,"" said MaÃ«lle Noir, from feminist NGO Nous Toutes (All of Us).
Some observers have reflected on the absence in this case of a single, totemic figure like GisÃ¨le Pelicot, whose public courage caught the public imagination and enabled people to find some light in an otherwise bleak story.
Others have reached more devastating conclusions.
""The issue is that this trial is about sexual abuse of children. 
There's a virtual omertÃ  on this topic globally, but particularly in France. ""We simply don't want to acknowledge it,"" Myriam Guedj-Benayoun, a lawyer representing several of Le Scouarnec's victims, told me.
In her closing arguments to the court, Ms Guedj-Benayoun condemned what she called France's ""systemic, organised silence"" regarding child abuse. 
She spoke of a patriarchal society in which men in respected positions like medicine remained almost beyond reproach and pointed to ""the silence of those who knew, those who looked the other way, and those who could have â should have â raised the alarm"".
Myriam Guedj-Benayoun (L) has spoken of a code of silence in France on child abuse (file pic)
The depravity exposed during the trial has been astonishing â too much for many to stomach.
The court in Vannes has heard in excruciating detail how Le Scouarnec, 74, wallowed in his paedophilia, carefully detailing each child rape in a succession of black notebooks, often preying on his vulnerable young patients while they were under anaesthetic or recovering from surgery. 
The court has also been told of the retired surgeon's growing isolation, and of what his own lawyer described as ""your descent into hell"", in the final decade before he was caught, in 2017, after abusing a neighbour's six-year-old daughter.
By the end, alone in a filthy house, drinking heavily and ostracised by many of his relatives, Le Scouarnec was spending much of his time watching violent images of child rape online, and obsessing over a collection of lifelike child-sized dolls.
""I was emotionally attached to them... They did what I wanted,"" Le Scouarnec told the court in his quiet monotone.
Joel Le Scouarnec (leaving the car) will undoubtedly face the rest of his life in jail
A few blocks from the courthouse, in an adapted civic hall, journalists have watched the proceedings unfold on a television screen. In recent days, the seats have begun to fill up and coverage of the trial has increased as it moves towards a close.
Many commentators have noted how the Le Scouarnec trial, like the Pelicot case, has exposed the deep institutional failings which enabled the surgeon to continue his rapes long after they could have been detected and stopped.
Dominique Pelicot had been caught ""upskirting"" in a supermarket in 2010 and his DNA quickly linked to an attempted rape in 1999 â a fact that, astonishingly, wasn't followed up for a whole decade.
At Le Scouarnec's trial a succession of medical officials have explained â some ashamedly, others self-servingly â how an overstretched rural healthcare system chose, for years, to ignore the fact that the surgeon had been reported by America's FBI in 2004 after using a credit card to pay to download videos of child rapes on his computer.
""I was advised not to talk about such and such a person,"" said one doctor who'd tried to sound the alarm.
""There is a shortage of surgeons, and those who show up are welcomed like the messiah,"" explained a hospital director.
""I messed up, I admit it, like the whole hierarchy,"" a different administrator finally conceded.
Another connection between the Pelicot and Le Scouarnec cases is what they've both revealed about our understanding â or lack of understanding â of trauma.
Without warning or support, GisÃ¨le Pelicot had been abruptly confronted by police with the video evidence of her own drugging and rapes. 
Later, during the trial, some defence lawyers and other commentators sought to minimise her suffering by pointing to the fact that she'd been unconscious during the rapes â as if trauma only exists, like a wound, when its scar is visible to the naked eye.
In the Le Scouarnec case, French police appear to have gone about searching for the paedophile's many victims in a similarly brusque manner, summoning people for an unexplained interview and then informing them, out of the blue, that they'd been listed in the surgeon's notebooks.
The reactions of Le Scouarnec's many victims have varied widely. Some have simply chosen not to engage with the trial, or with a childhood experience of which they have no memory.
For others, news of the abuse has affected them profoundly.
""You've entered my head, it's destroying me. I've become a different person â one I don't recognise,"" said a victim, addressing Le Scouarnec in court.
""I have no memories and I'm already damaged,"" said another.
""It turned me upside down,"" a policeman admitted.
And then there is a different group of people who â not unlike GisÃ¨le Pelicot â have found that knowledge of their abuse has been revelatory, enabling them to make sense of things they had not previously understood about themselves or their lives.
Some have connected their childhood abuse to a general sense of unhappiness, or poor behaviour, or failure in life. 
For others, the links have been much more specific, helping to explain a litany of mysterious symptoms and behaviours, from a fear of intimacy to repeated genital infections and eating disorders.
""With my boyfriend, every time we have sex, I vomit,"" one woman revealed in court.
AmÃ©lie LÃ©vÃªque-Merle was operated on in 1991 and has had a fear of hospitals ever since
""I had so many after-effects from my operation. But no-one could explain why I had this irrational fear of hospitals,"" said another victim, AmÃ©lie.
Some have described the trial itself as being like a group therapy session, with victims bonding over shared traumas which they'd previously believed they were suffering alone.
""This trial is like a clinical laboratory involving 300 victims. I sincerely hope it will change France. In any case it will change the victims' perception of trauma and traumatic memory,"" said the lawyer, Ms Guedj-Benayoun.
Despite her concerns about the lack of public interest, Manon Lemoine said the trial had helped the victims ""to rebuild ourselves, to turn a page. We lay out our pain and our experiences and we leave it behind [in the courtroom]. So, for me, really, it was liberating.""
Having confessed to his crimes, Le Scouarnec will inevitably receive a guilty verdict and will almost certainly remain in prison for the rest of his life. 
Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial - a fact which he acknowledged in court with the same penitent but formulaic apology that he's offered to everyone else.
Meanwhile, some activists remain hopeful that the case will prove to be a turning point in French society.
""Compared to the Pelicot trial... we can see we don't talk very much about the Le Scouarnec case. We need to unite. We have to do this, otherwise nothing will happen, and the Le Scouarnec trial will have served no purpose. I was also a victim as a child. We're obliged to react and to organise ourselves,"" said Arnaud Gallais, a child rights campaigner and founder of the Mouv'Enfants NGO.
A more wary assessment came from the lawyer, Ms Guedj-Benayoun.
""Now, there is a very important standoff between those who want to denounce child sexual violence and those who want to cover it up, and this standoff is taking place today in this trial. Who will win?"" she wondered.

""A lot of people ask me: 'Father Moses, how can I increase my manliness to absurd levels?'""
In a YouTube video, external, a priest is championing a form of virile, unapologetic masculinity.
Skinny jeans, crossing your legs, using an iron, shaping your eyebrows, and even eating soup are among the things he derides as too feminine.
There are other videos of Father Moses McPherson - a powerfully built father of five - weightlifting to the sound of heavy metal.
He was raised a Protestant and once worked as a roofer, but now serves as a priest in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) in Georgetown, Texas, an offshoot of the mother church in Moscow.
ROCOR, a global network with headquarters in New York, has recently been expanding across parts of the US - mainly as a result of people converting from other faiths. 
In the last six months, Father Moses has prepared 75 new followers for baptism in his church of the Mother of God, just north of Austin.
""When my wife and I converted 20 years ago we used to call Orthodoxy the best-kept secret, because people just didn't know what it was,"" he says. 
""But in the past year-and-a-half our congregation has tripled in size.""
Convert Theodore - who until recently rejected all religion - lifts weights three times a week with Father Moses
During the Sunday liturgy at Father Moses's church, I am struck by the number of men in their twenties and thirties praying and crossing themselves at the back of the nave, and how this religion - with traditions dating back to the 4th century AD - seems to attract young men uneasy with life in modern America.
Software engineer Theodore tells me he had a dream job and a wife he adored, but he felt empty inside, as if there was a hole in his heart. He believes society has been ""very harsh"" on men and is constantly telling them they are in the wrong. He complains that men are criticised for wanting to be the breadwinner and support a stay-at-home wife.
""We are told that's a very toxic relationship nowadays,"" Theodore says. ""That's not how it should be.""
Almost all the converts I meet have opted to home-school their offspring, partly because they believe women should prioritise their families rather than their careers.
Father John Whiteford, an archpriest in the ROCOR from Spring, north of Houston, says home-schooling ensures a religious education and is ""a way of protecting your children"", while avoiding any talk about ""transgenderism, or the 57 genders of the month or whatever"".
The Americans converting to Orthodox Christianity
 
Compared to the millions of worshippers in America's evangelical megachurches, the numbers of Christian Orthodox are tiny - only about one percent of the population. That includes Eastern Orthodoxy, as practised across Russia, Ukraine, eastern Europe and Greece, and the Oriental Orthodox from the Middle East and Africa.
Founded by priests and clergy fleeing the Russian Revolution in 1917, ROCOR is seen by many as the most conservative Orthodox jurisdiction in the US. Yet this small religious community is a vocal one, and what's unfolding within it mirrors broader political shifts, especially following President Donald Trump's dramatic pivot toward Moscow.
The true increase in the number of converts is hard to quantify, but data from the Pew Research Centre, external suggests Orthodox Christians are 64% male, up from 46% in 2007.
A smaller study, external of 773 converts appears to back the trend. Most recent newcomers are men, and many say the pandemic pushed them to seek a new faith. That survey is from the Orthodox Church in America, external (OCA), which was established by Russian monks in Alaska in the late 18th Century and now has more than 700 parishes, missions, communities, monasteries, and institutions in the US, Canada and Mexico which identify as Russian Orthodox.
Professor Scott Kenworthy, who studies the history and thought of Eastern Orthodox Christianity - particularly in modern Russia - says his OCA parish in Cincinnati ""is absolutely bursting at the seams"". 
He's attended the same church for 24 years and says congregation numbers remained steady until the Covid lockdown. Since then, there has been constant flow of new inquirers and people preparing to be baptised, known as catechumens.  
""This is not just a phenomenon of my own parish, or a few places in Texas,"" Prof Kenworthy says, ""it is definitely something broader."" 
The digital space is key in this wave of new converts. Father Moses has a big following online - when he shares a picture of a positive pregnancy test, external  on his Instagram feed he gets 6,000 likes for announcing the arrival of his sixth child. 
But there are dozens of other podcasts and videos presented by Orthodox clergy and an army of followers - mainly male.
Father Moses tells his congregation there are two ways of serving God - being a monk or a nun, or getting married. Those who take the second path should avoid contraception and have as many children as possible.
""Show me one saint in the history of the Church who ever blessed any kind of birth control,"" Father Moses says. As for masturbation - or what the church calls self-abuse - the priest condemns it as ""pathetic and unmanly"".
Father Moses says Orthodoxy is ""not masculine, it is just normal"", while ""in the West everything has become very feminised"". Some Protestant churches, he believes, mainly cater for women.
""I don't want to go to services that feel like a Taylor Swift concert,"" Father Moses says. ""If you look at the language of the 'worship music', it's all emotion - that's not men.""
Elissa Bjeletich Davis, a former Protestant who now belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church in Austin, is a Sunday school teacher and has her own podcast, external. She says many converts belong to ""the anti-woke crowd"" and sometimes have strange ideas about their new faith - especially those in the Russian Church.
""They see it as a military, rigid, disciplinary, masculine, authoritarian religion,"" Elissa says. ""It's kind of funny. It's almost as if the old American Puritans and their craziness is resurfacing.""
Former atheist Buck began exploring Russian Orthodoxy during the Covid pandemic 
Buck Johnson has worked as a firefighter for 25 years and hosts the Counterflow podcast, external.
He says he was initially scared to enter his local Russian Orthodox Church as he ""looks different, covered in tattoos"", but tells me he was welcomed with open arms. He was also impressed the church stayed open throughout the Covid lockdown.
Sitting on a couch in front of two huge TV screens at his home in Lockhart, he says his newfound faith is changing his view of the world.
""Negative American views on Russia are what worry me,"" Buck says. He tells me the mainstream, ""legacy"" media presents a distorted picture of the invasion of Ukraine.
""I think there's a holdover from the boomer generation here in America that lived through the Cold War,"" Buck says, ""and I don't quite grasp why - but they say Russia's bad.""
The head of the Russian Church in Moscow, Patriarch Kirill, has doggedly backed the invasion of Ukraine, calling it a Holy War, and expressing little compassion for its victims. When I ask Archpriest Father John Whiteford about Russia's top cleric, who many see as a warmonger, he assures me the Patriarch's words have been distorted.
Footage and photographs of Putin quoting Bible verses, holding candles during services in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and stripping down to his swim trunks to plunge into icy water at Epiphany, seem to have struck a chord. Some - in America and other countries - see Russia as the last bastion of true Christianity.
Archpriest John Whiteford, pictured with his wife Patricia, says home-schooling is ""a way of protecting your children""
Nearly a decade ago, another Orthodox convert turned priest from Texas, Father Joseph Gleason, moved from America to Borisoglebskiy, a village four hours' drive north of Moscow, with his wife and eight children.
""Russia does not have homosexual marriage, it does not have civil unions, it is a place where you can home-school your kids and - of course - I love the thousand-year history of Orthodox Christianity here,"" he told a Russian video host.
This wispy-bearded Texan is in the vanguard of a movement urging conservatives to relocate to Russia. Last August, Putin introduced fast-track shared values visa, external for those fleeing Western liberalism.
Back in Texas, Buck tells me he and his fellow converts are turning their backs on instant gratification and American consumerism.
""We're thinking of things long term,"" Buck says, ""like traditions, love for your family, love for you community, love for neighbours. 
""I think that orthodoxy fits us well - and especially in Texas."""
139,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpd41g661epo,2025-05-24 23:01:05,"Murdered on the school run: The controversial Ukrainian gunned down in Madrid,","Andriy Portnov's murder in a Madrid suburb may have been shocking, but it has not exactly triggered an outpouring of grief in Ukraine.
The controversial former official had just dropped his children off at the American School when he was shot several times in the car park.
The image of his lifeless body lying face down in gym kit marked the end of a life synonymous with Ukrainian corruption and Russian influence.
Ukraine's media have been discussing the 51-year-old's frequent threats to journalists, as well as his huge influence under the country's last pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych.
""A man who called for the killing of political opponents suddenly got what he wanted from others,"" observed reporter Oleksandr Holubov. News website Ukrayinska Pravda even called him ""the devil's advocate"". 
Rare words of restraint came from Portnov's once political rival Serhiy Vlasenko, an MP, who said: ""You can't kill people. When discussing someone's death, we must remain human.""
Portnov was controversial and widely disliked. The motives for his murder may seem evident, but his death has still left unanswered questions.
Before entering Ukrainian politics, Portnov ran a law firm. He worked with then-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko until 2010, before defecting to Yanukovych's camp when he won the election.
""It was a big story of betrayal,"" remembers Ukrainian journalist Kristina Berdynskykh. ""Because Tymoshenko was a pro-Western politician, and Yanukovych pro-Russian.""
Portnov had worked closely with then-Prime Minister Tymoshenko
The adviser became the country's first deputy head of the Presidential Office and set up a national criminal code in 2012. For him, his critics say, his ascent was less about politics, and more about power and influence.
""He was just a good lawyer, everyone knew he was very smart,"" Kristina tells me.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Ukraine inherited a judicial system in desperate need of reform. Mykhailo Zhernakov, a legal expert and head of the Dejure Foundation believes Portnov remoulded it in order for the government to cover up illegal schemes, and to mask Russian attempts to control the country.
""He was the kingpin, mastermind and architect of this corrupt legal system designed to serve the pro-Russian administration at the time,"" he says.
Over a decade, Portnov would sue journalists who wrote negative stories about him through the courts and judges he controlled. His attempts to control the judicial system would lead to him being sanctioned by the US.
At the time, Washington accused the adviser of placing loyal officials in senior positions for his own benefit, as well as ""buying court decisions"".
Portnov later pursued activists who took part in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution, which toppled Viktor Yanukovych from power, and forced him to escape the country to Russia.
""He used sexual threats,"" says Oksana Romaniuk who remembers her and other journalists' interactions with Portnov well.
As director of the Institute of Mass Information, she monitors free speech in Ukraine.
Whenever a damning report was published, the reaction was familiar and consistent. ""When people exposed his corruption, he accused them of fake news,"" she says.
""Even when journalists had documents and testimonies backing up the allegations, it was impossible to win the lawsuits in court. It was impossible to defend yourself. It was a rotten system.""
Portnov (R) became an integral part of Viktor Yanukovych's presidential team
Andriy Portnov eventually settled in Moscow after his old boss Yanukovych fled in 2014. Investigative reporter Maksym Savchuk subsequently investigated his ties to Moscow, as well as his extensive property portfolio there.
""He responded with words I don't want to quote, derogatory ones about my mother,"" he remembers. ""It's a trait of his character; he is a very vindictive person.""
Even after leaving Ukraine, Portnov still tried to influence Ukrainian politics by taking control of pro-Kremlin TV channel NewsOne.
He returned in 2019, only to flee again with the full-scale invasion in 2022.
The irony of Portnov eventually settling in Spain and sending his children to a prestigious American school has not been lost on many.
Alongside the undisguised delight in Portnov's death, there has been endless speculation over who was responsible.
""It could have been the Russians because he knew so many things,"" suggests legal expert Mykhailo Zhernakov.
""He was involved in so many shady Russian operations it could be them or other criminal groups. He managed to annoy a lot of people,"" he says.
Despite the motives being clearer on this side of the border, Ukrainian security sources appear to be trying to distance themselves from the killing. 
Kyiv has previously carried out assassinations in Russian-occupied territory and in Russia itself, but not in Spain.
Some Spanish media reports suggest his murder was not political, but rather over ""economic reasons or revenge"".
""You can imagine how many people need to be interrogated in order to narrow down the suspects,"" thinks Maskym Savchuk. ""Because this person has a thousand and one enemies.""
In Ukraine, Portnov is seen as someone who helped Russia form the foundations for its invasion. A once general dislike of him has only been intensified since 2022.
Despite this, Mykhailo Zhernakov hopes his death is also an opportunity for wider judicial reforms.
""Just because he's gone doesn't mean his influence has,"" he warns. ""Because many of the people he appointed or helped get jobs are still in the system.""

Russian aerial attacks on Ukraine have killed at least 13 people and injured 56 civilians across the country since Friday, according to regional officials. 
Russia launched 250 drones and 14 ballistic missiles against Kyiv alone, Ukraine's air force said, causing fires in residential buildings. 
At least 14 people were injured in the capital. It was one of the biggest combined aerial assaults on the city since the war began. 
The air force said it had downed six missiles and 245 drones.
""With each such attack, the world becomes more certain that the cause of prolonging the war lies in Moscow,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.
The overnight barrage came as Russia and Ukraine are taking part in prisoner swaps agreed after talks between the two sides in Turkey.
Describing a ""difficult night"", Zelensky said there had been fires and explosions across Kyiv with homes, businesses and cars damaged by strikes or falling debris. 
Two schools and a clinic were among the facilities hit in the Kyiv region. 
Olha Chyrukha, a 64-year-old Kyiv resident, told Reuters news agency: ""I wish they'd agree to a ceasefire. To bomb people like this - poor children. My three-year-old granddaughter was screaming scared."" 
Four people were killed in the eastern Donetsk region; five in the southern Odesa and Kherson regions and four in the northeast Kharkiv region. 
Drones hit port infrastructure in Odesa on Saturday, local authorities reported. 
Residential, facilities and several blocks of flats across Ukraine were damaged.  Over 100 people were evacuated, including 13 children from front line areas. 
Commenting on the combined use of aerial weapons, Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said: ""The enemy is improving its own tactics of using drones, while simultaneously striking with ballistics.""
Zelensky said only ""additional sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy"" could push Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.
Last week, Russia said Ukraine had launched hundreds of exploding drones at the country, including strikes over Moscow. The Russia's defence ministry said that 485 drones had been shot down.

On Saturday, Zelensky announced that 307 Ukrainian prisoners had returned home as part of an exchange deal with the Kremlin.
On Friday, Ukraine and Russia each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since Russia launched its full-scale assault in February 2022. 
The two countries have agreed to swap a total of 1,000 prisoners each, and another exchange is expected on Sunday.
Ukrainians who had been captured by Russia are released as part of an exchange
US President Donald Trump, who has pledged but so far failed to end the war, suggested on social media that the swap ""could lead to something big???"". 
Earlier this week, Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war, after which he said the Kremlin and Ukraine would ""immediately start"" negotiations for a ceasefire.
However, Putin has only said Russia would work with Ukraine to craft a ""memorandum on a possible future peace agreement"", and failed to address calls for a 30-day ceasefire."

A 37-year-old cryptocurrency investor appeared in court on Saturday after being arrested for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist in a Manhattan home, according to media reports. 
John Woeltz was arraigned in New York Criminal Court at 9:00 EST (14:00 BST) on charges of kidnapping with intent to collect ransom, assault, unlawful imprisonment and other counts, court records show. 
A second person, 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi, was arrested on Saturday in connection to the case, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. 
The pair were taken into custody after the victim managed to escape a home in SoHo, where he was allegedly tortured and bound for weeks, police said. 
The BBC has contacted the New York Police Department, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and Mr Woeltz's attorney for comment. 
The 28-year-old victim, who has not been named, was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition, police have said. Officers found several Polaroid photos of the victim being tied up and tortured, as well as firearms, in the luxury townhome, according to reports. 
The victim told police he came to New York from Italy on 6 May, and that upon arriving at the suspect's house, Mr Woeltz took his passport and allegedly held him captive until he escaped on Friday morning.
According to a criminal complaint obtained by ABC News, the victim told police that Mr Woeltz and another person beat him and hanged him off a ledge when he refused to provide his bitcoin password. 
Mr Woeltz is a crypto investor from Kentucky and has been renting the SoHo home for between $30,000 (Â£22,000) and $40,000 per month, according to CBS News."

Musicians have gathered for a fundraising event to support the people of Ukraine.
The fourth Play for Ukraine event since the war with Russia began in 2022 was being held at the Face Bar in Reading, Berkshire, on Saturday.
All donations from the event will be used to pay for a vehicle loaded with essential supplies, which will be sent to the frontline.
Organiser and drummer, Pete Laschok, whose father was Ukrainian, said it was not a political event and was ""just about helping people"".
All money raised by the event will be used to pay for a vehicle loaded with essential supplies
""I just want to help in some way, in a humanitarian sense,"" Mr Laschok said, explaining he was so ""upset"" and ""emotional"" when he saw the war unfold.
""Bombs are still flying, people are getting killed,"" he said.
He said he did not feel hopeful that peace would be achieved soon, adding that he believed the people of Ukraine would always need some kind of help.
Five bands volunteered to perform at this year's event - Pink Diamond Revue, Natural Right, Hoopy Frood, Kryla and He Fired First.
.Mr Laschok said the vehicle they managed to fundraise for last year was still in operation in Ukraine.
He told the BBC he hoped his efforts would have made his late father proud but said it was ""good that he's not here to see it because he would be devastated by it"".
Stefan Bomok is from the Reading Branch of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, which will receive the donations from the fundraiser and ensure the vehicle gets to Ukraine.
He said the organisation had sent five 4x4 vehicles from Reading so far.
""The [new] vehicle will be ferrying back and forwards, military stuff and medical aide to the frontline and wounded back to hospitals,"" he said.
Mr Bomok, whose late father was Ukrainian, said the first time his family visited the country was just before it achieved independence.
He said: ""We saw the flags being raised outside the white building in Kyiv and I felt more at home going back to Ukraine, even though I was never born there, than in England. 
""What my father gave me was culturally very strong.""

About 160,000 homes in the city of Cannes and surrounding areas lost power early on Saturday, before supply was restored in the afternoon. 
Officials said an electricity substation had been set on fire and a pylon at another location damaged. 
Organisers of the international film festival say the closing ceremony will go ahead as planned as they have an alternative power supply. 
Prosecutors say a first power cut occurred when a substation in the village of Tanneron, which supplies Cannes, was attacked by arsonists in the early hours.
At about 10:00 (08:00 GMT) the legs of an electricity pylon near the town of Villeneuve-Loubet were cut, triggering a second outage.  
In Cannes, shops and restaurants struggled to operate. 
""Another hour and I'll throw everything away,"" Laurent Aboukrat, who owns Cannes' Jamin restaurant, told the AFP news agency. He said his fridges had been off since the morning.

Several ice cream shops were closed in Cannes following the outage 
""Cannes is in a total slowdown, meltdown, there's no coffee anywhere, and I think the town has run out of croissants, so this is like crisis territory,"" Australian producer  Darren Vukasinovic told Reuters news agency.
Several screenings were interrupted by the cut in the morning, before festival organisers were able to switch to private generators.

An Israeli air strike on Gaza hit the home of a doctor and killed nine of her 10 children, the hospital where she works in the city of Khan Younis says.
Nasser hospital said one of Dr Alaa al-Najjar's children and her husband were injured, but survived. 
Graeme Groom, a British surgeon working in the hospital who operated on her surviving 11-year-old boy, told the BBC it was ""unbearably cruel"" that his mother, who spent years caring for children as a paediatrician, could lose almost all her own in a single missile strike.
Israel's military said its aircraft had struck ""a number of suspects"" in Khan Younis on Friday, and ""the claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review"".
A video shared by the director of the Hamas-run health ministry and verified by the BBC showed small burned bodies lifted from the rubble of a strike in Khan Younis.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its ""aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis"".
""The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety,"" the Israeli military said.
In a general statement on Saturday, the IDF said it had struck more than 100 targets across Gaza over the past day.
The health ministry said at least 74 people had been killed by the Israeli military over the 24 hour-period leading up to about midday on Saturday.
Dr Muneer Alboursh, director of the health ministry, said on X that the al-Najjars' family house was hit minutes after Dr al-Najjar's husband Hamdi had returned home after driving his wife to work.
Dr Alboursh said the eldest of Dr al-Najjar's children was aged 12.
Adam, 11, is Dr Alaa al-Najjar's only surviving child
Mr Groom said the children's father was ""very badly injured"", in a video posted on the Instagram account, external of another British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, Victoria Rose.
He told the BBC that the father had a ""penetrating injury to his head"".
He said he had asked about the father, also a doctor at the hospital, and had been told he had ""no political and no military connections and doesn't seem to be prominent on social media"".
He described it as an ""unimaginable"" situation for Dr Alaa al-Najjar.
Mr Groom said the surviving 11-year-old boy, Adam, was ""quite small"" for his age. 
""His left arm was just about hanging off, he was covered in fragment injuries and he had several substantial lacerations,"" he told the BBC.
""Since both his parents are doctors, he seemed to be among the privileged group within Gaza, but as we lifted him onto the operating table, he felt much younger than 11.""
""Our little boy could survive, but we don't know about his father,"" he added.
Mahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, said on Telegram on Friday afternoon that his teams had recovered eight bodies and several injured from the al-Najjar house near a petrol station in Khan Younis. 
The hospital initially posted on Facebook that eight children had been killed, then two hours later updated that number to nine.
Another doctor, Youssef Abu al-Rish, said in a statement posted by the health ministry that he had arrived to the operating room to find Dr al-Najjar waiting for information about her surviving son and tried to console her.
In an interview recorded by AFP news agency, relative Youssef al-Najjar said: ""Enough! Have mercy on us! We plead to all countries, the international community, the people, Hamas, and all factions to have mercy on us.
""We are exhausted from the displacement and the hunger, enough!""
On Friday, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that people in Gaza were enduring what may be ""the cruellest phase"" of the war, and denounced Israel's blockade on humanitarian aid imposed in March.
Israel partially lifted the blockade earlier this week. Israeli military body Cogat said 83 more trucks carrying flour, food, medical equipment pharmaceutical drugs entered Gaza on Friday. 
The UN has repeatedly said the amount of aid entering is nowhere near enough for the territory's 2.1 million people - saying between 500 to 600 trucks a day are needed - and has called for Israel to allow in much more.
The limited amount of food that trickled into Gaza this week sparked chaotic scenes, with armed looters attacking an aid convoy and Palestinians crowding outside bakeries in a desperate attempt to obtain bread.
A UN-backed assessment this month said Gaza's population was at ""critical risk"" of famine. 
People in Gaza have told the BBC they have no food, and malnourished mothers are unable to breastfeed babies.
Palestinians try to get bread at a bakery window in Gaza on 22 May
Chronic shortages of water are also worsening as desalination and hygiene plants are running out of fuel, and Israel's expanding military offensive causes new waves of displacement.
Israel has said the blockade was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza. 
Israel has accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,901 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

A Nigerian senator has told the BBC she only learnt that the government was suing her ""on the news"" and that she was ""shocked"" by the action taken against her.
The government filed defamation charges against Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan after she accused one of the country's top politicians of plotting to kill her.
In April, Akpoti-Uduaghan alleged that Senate President Godswill Akpabio and former state governor Yahaya Bell wanted to ""eliminate"" her. Both have denied this accusation.
She had previously accused Akpabio of sexually harassing her - an allegation he has also denied.
After learning of the charges against her, Akpoti-Uduaghan told the BBC: ""I'm actually shocked. My first reaction when I read it is out of shock, because I have not been served [with papers] until now. I had to read it on the news.""
A spokesperson for the senate president said they had ""evidence beyond reasonable doubt"" that she had been served the court papers.
He added that he hoped Akpoti-Uduaghan would take advantage of the next court hearing to prove her allegations.
A special legal adviser in the senate president's office later told the BBC that Akpabio ""had no involvement whatsoever in the investigation, recommendation, or decision to prosecute"" and the charges were initiated after a police investigation.
In the charge sheet, seen by the BBC, Nigeria's attorney general referenced a live interview broadcast by Nigeria's Channels TV last month.
Akpoti-Uduaghan alleged in the interview that there were ""discussions that Akpabio had with Yahaya Bello... to eliminate me"".
The attorney general said that this statement, and others made in the same broadcast, could harm Bello and Akpabio's reputations.
But Akpoti-Uduaghan stands by her allegation. She said she had even gone to the police with the accusation that Akpabio and Bello posed a threat to her life.
""Do you understand the twist? I was the one who ran to the police. I made my petitions, I appeared on television, I spoke publicly on the threat to my life,"" she said.
""Instead, it is the senate president and [former] governor Yahaya Bello's counter-petition, which is me defaming them, that is being attended to.""
Akpoti-Uduaghan said the charges were an attempt to ""intimidate her"" and make her ""fall in line"" after she accused Akabio of sexual harassment in February.
""It's an ill that has been normalised in the society - sexual harassment. But here I am speaking about it... that was my first offence. Natasha is not supposed to speak about it. I'm supposed to bear it as a woman,"" she told the BBC.
Akabio's legal adviser again denied these allegations: ""The claim that he is 'using the authorities at his disposal' to unfairly target anyone is baseless, unsubstantiated, and again, defamatory.""
The charges mark the latest twist in a row that has engrossed Nigeria, raising questions about gender equality in the socially conservative nation.
Akpoti-Uduaghan is one of just four women out of 109 senators.
After accusing Akabio of sexual harassment, she was suspended from the Senate for six months without pay. 
The Senate's ethics committee said the suspension was for her ""unruly and disruptive"" behaviour while the Senate was debating her allegations.
However, Akpoti-Uduaghan and her supporters argued that the committee was targeting her because of the allegations she had made against the senate president.
No date has been set for her to appear in court.

Joseph Kabila, the ex-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has lashed out at the government of his successor - calling it a ""dictatorship"".
The 53-year-old made a 45-minute speech live on YouTube on Friday evening from an unspecified location a day after the Senate lifted his immunity from prosecution.
DR Congo's authorities intend to charge the former president with treason and war crimes, linking him to the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, who have taken control of several towns in the east.
Kabila, in power between 2001 and 2019, said he had broken his silence because he felt the unity of the country was at risk.
Analysts say any trial of Kabila could further destabilise the country, which has been battling the M23 rebellion since 2012.
The government of President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi has not responded to the speech in which Kabila also set out a 12-point plan that he said could help end decades of insecurity in the mineral-rich east of DR Congo.
PODCAST: Why are people talking about Kabila's return?
What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?
Dressed in a navy suit with a Congolese flag badge pinned to his lapel, Kabila stood before a lectern in what was termed an ""address to the nation"" - a broadcast topped and tailed by the national anthem. 
The YouTube link shared by his spokesperson, external has subsequently been deleted, but the recording has been shared by numerous other accounts, external.
Once an ally of Tshisekedi, Kabila fell out with his successor and their parties' coalition formally ended in 2020.
The former president has been living outside the country for two years - he initially left to pursue a doctorate in South Africa.
During his speech, he hit out at ""arbitrary decisions"" taken by the government last month after ""rumours"" that he had travelled to the eastern city of Goma.
This prompted the authorities to ban his People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) and order the seizure of his assets.
It all ""testifies to the spectacular decline of democracy in our country"", Kabila said.
During his speech, he did mention that he intended to go to Goma ""in the coming days"", where he is not in danger of arrest as the city has been under control of the M23 rebels since January.
Kabila also hit out at the president for trying to undermine the constitution, at parliament for failing to hold the president to account and at the justice system for allowing itself to be ""openly exploited for political end"".
He was critical of government's handling of the economy, corruption and public debt, which he said had ""skyrocketed"" to more than $10bn (Â£7.3bn).
Kabila, a former major-general, was also disparaging about the government's handling of the security situation countrywide, especially the use of pro-government militias as ""auxiliaries"" of the armed forces.
""The national armyâ¦ has been replaced by mercenary bands, armed groups, tribal militias, and foreign armed forces that have not only demonstrated their limitations but also plunged the country into indescribable chaos.""
He mentioned that one of these armed groups was the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), an ethnic Hutu militia involved in the Rwandan genocide in 1994 and still active in eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda sees the presence of the FDLR rebels as an existential threat. Rwandan troops are currently in DR Congo in support of the M23, which is mainly led by ethnic Tutsis who say they took arms to protect the rights of the minority group.
Kabila urged the withdrawal of ""all foreign troops"" from DR Congo and welcomed a recent decision by Southern African Development Community (Sadc) to pull out troop that had been deployed to help the army fight the M23.
After 18 years in power, Kabila maintained that the achievements he had made had been squandered.
""In record time - six years - we are back at square one: that of a failed, divided, disintegrated state, on the verge of implosion, and ranked high on the list of the most corrupt and heavily indebted poor countries,"" he said.
Reaction to his address has been mixed, with some pointing out the irony that many of his criticisms of Tshisekedi's administration reflected those levelled at his own government.
""The dictatorship must end, and democracy, as well as good economic and social governance, must be restored,"" he said towards the end of the speech.
Kabila noted that the government had ""finally resolved to sit around the same table"" with M23 but felt other countrywide peace initiatives backed by the Catholic church should be pursued.
DR Congo and Rwanda, which denies accusations it backs the M23, may be edging towards a peace deal to end the fighting, which has seen hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes in recent months.
The two countries signed a preliminary agreement in Washington last month and said they had agreed on a pathway to peace.

The Irish government is to apologise to the family of a cyclist killed in a hit-and-run by a driver who should have been in jail at the time of the crash.
Shane O'Farrell was 23 when he was hit by a car while cycling near his home in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, in 2011.
The driver, Zigimantas Gridziuska, had more than 40 convictions at the time, including some in Northern Ireland.
Mr O'Farrell's mother, Lucia O'Farrell, told Irish broadcast RTÃ that her family is expecting a public apology , externalto be made in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Tuesday. 

The O'Farrell family have campaigned for years for a public inquiry into their son's death. 
""Shane's case raises serious issues about how the criminal justice system works and how it ought to work,"" Mrs O'Farrell told RTÃ's Colm Ã MongÃ¡in. 
""We await the apology on Tuesday.""
The body of the young law graduate was found nearly 60 yards (54m) from the point where he was hit by a car on 2 August 2011.
Gridziuska, a Lithuanian national, left the scene of the fatal crash but the following day he handed himself into gardaÃ­ (Irish police).
He had been a regular defendant in courts in Monaghan, Cavan and Louth in the years prior to the killing, according to RTÃ
In the January before the fatal crash, a ruling from Monaghan Circuit Court meant Gridziuska should have been in jail at the time of Mr O'Farrell's death.
Instead, he remained on bail.
Another prison sentence handed down in February 2011 was also not imposed.
The Court Services of Ireland previously said Gridziuska's prison sentences were never served because of what it described as an administrative error.
As part of their long-running campaign, the O'Farrell family have previously travelled to Belfast and Brussels to raise their case in Stormont and the European Parliament."

Warning: This story contains details of sexual assault
A Ugandan activist who was arrested and held for days in Tanzania and later found at the border between the two countries has told the BBC that she was raped while in detention.
Expanding on the earlier remarks of her rights group who said she showed ""indications of torture"", Agather Atuhaire alleged that people dressed in plain clothes ""blindfolded"" her, after which she was hit, ""violently"" stripped and sexually assaulted.
Atuhaire had been held incommunicado in Tanzania alongside fellow Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi, who was on Thursday found at the border with his home country.
The Tanzanian authorities have not commented.
Regional rights groups have called for an investigation and the US Department of State's Bureau of Africa Affairs said it was deeply concerned by the reports of the two activists' mistreatment.
""The pain was too much,"" said Atuhaire, showing the BBC a scar from where she said she had been handcuffed.
She added that she was ""screaming so hard"" that they had to cover her mouth.
Atuhaire told the BBC about her alleged rape in graphic detail.
She said she also heard screams from Mwangi, and that those holding him had threatened to circumcise him.
The pair had gone to Tanzania to show solidarity with opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who appeared in court on Monday after being charged with treason
Mwangi recounted his alleged experience in a post on X:, external ""We had been tortured, and we were told to strip naked and to go bathe. We couldn't walk and were told to crawl and go wash off the blood.""
Despite being allowed into the country, Mwangi and Atuhaire were not permitted to attend the hearing and were arrested.
On Monday, President Samia Suluhu Hassan had warned that she would not allow activists from neighbouring countries to ""meddle"" in her country's affairs and cause ""chaos"".
Why Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political anger
Atuhaire was found abandoned at the border on Thursday night after being held in custody since Monday, Agora Centre for Research, the Uganda-based rights group that she leads, posted on X. 
Uganda's high commissioner to Tanzania Fred Mwesigye said Atuhaire had ""safely returned home"" and had been ""warmly received by her family"". 
Mwangi, who was earlier found abandoned on a roadside in northern Tanzania near the Kenyan border, said he had heard Atuhaire ""groaning in pain"" when they were held together on Tuesday. 
""Any attempt to speak to each other during the night we were tortured was met with kicks and insults. We were removed from the torture location in different vehicles,"" Mwangi added.
He said those who were holding them were getting orders from a ""state security"" official, who directed the activist to be given a ""Tanzanian treatment"". 
Kenya's state-funded rights body shared a picture of Mwangi (centre) on Thursday
Mwangi's disappearance had sparked widespread concern across Kenya, with his family, civil society and human rights groups staging protests and demanding his release.
On Wednesday, the Kenyan government formally protested against his detention, accusing the Tanzanian authorities of denying consular access despite repeated requests.
Earlier on Thursday, Kenya's foreign affairs ministry issued a statement saying it had not been able to access the activist.
Regional rights groups have called for an investigation into the alleged mistreatment of the activists by the Tanzanian authorities and urged all East African countries to uphold rights treaties.
The US Department of State's Bureau of Africa Affairs said it was deeply concerned by the reports of the two activists' mistreatment, noting that Ms Atuhaire had been recognised by the department ""in 2024 as an International Women of Courage Awardee"".
""We call for an immediate and full investigation into the allegations of human rights abuses. We urge all countries in the region to hold to account those responsible for violating human rights, including torture,"" it tweeted, external.

However, they have fallen short of the majority they wanted.
Carney remains prime minister, having only assumed the role in early March following Justin Trudeau's resignation. 
His main rival, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, has lost his own seat as has Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP).


Carney's Liberals have 169 seats but would need 172 for a majority.
The Conservatives remain in opposition as the second-largest party and are on 144 seats.
The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois is on 22 seats and only runs candidates in the province of Quebec. The NDP has been reduced to seven seats and the Green Party to one.
While the election took place on 28 April, it took several weeks for some results to be confirmed.
Elections in four areas were very close and went to judicial recounts - a formal means of verifying the counts, each presided over by a judge.
They found that in Terrebonne, Quebec, the Liberals won by one vote and in Milton East-Halton Hills South, Ontario, the party won by 21 votes.
And in Windsor-Tecumseh-Lakeshore in Ontario, the Conservatives were confirmed by a judge to have won by four votes.
Finally, on 23 May, the Conservatives were revealed to have won Terra Nova-The Peninsulas in Newfoundland and Labrador by 12 votes following a judicial recount. Preliminary results had seen the party lose the seat to the Liberals by the same margin.
Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have seen a significant rise in their share of the national vote compared with four years ago.
Increased support for Canada's two largest parties has come at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the NDP whose share of the popular vote is down by almost 12 percentage points.
The rise in support for the Conservatives was not enough to save Poilievre, who lost his own seat in Carleton, Ontario.
The 45-year-old had promised a return to ""common sense politics"".
Opinion polls at the start of the year had the Conservatives over 20 percentage points ahead of the Liberals. But after the resignation of former Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the arrival of new PM Mark Carney, as well as the tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, that lead evaporated.
In his own seat, Poilievre had 90 opponents, including dozens of independent candidates linked to a group calling for electoral reform.
NDP leader Singh also lost his own seat in the House of Commons, coming third behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates.
Canada has a ""first-past-the-post"" electoral system.
The candidate who gets the most votes in each electoral district, or riding, wins that seat and becomes a Member of Parliament (MP).
The Liberals and the Conservatives have dominated the popular vote, with both parties receiving more than 40% each of ballots counted across Canada.
Between them, they have over 90% of seats.
The NDP has received just over 6% of the total vote, but this translates to just 2% of seats in the House of Commons.
The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois has just over 6% of the vote and a similar share of seats.
The Liberals have the most seats in the key provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which account for 200 of Canada's 343 electoral districts.
The Conservatives took all but three of the 37 seats in Alberta, while it was a close race between the two main parties in British Columbia, where the Conservatives have 19 seats and the Liberals 20.
One of the most closely-watched areas was around Toronto. The ""905"" are places that all share the same telephone code.
While the Liberals have won in most of Toronto, including a seat they lost in a by-election last year, the Conservatives were able to flip some of the ridings in the surrounding region.
The NDP have lost a seat, Hamilton Centre, that they'd held for over 20 years.
Preliminary results saw Milton East-Halton Hills South flip from the Liberals to the Conservatives by 298 votes. However, following vote validation and a judicial recount, it was found to have stayed Liberal by 21 votes.
After Ontario, Quebec is the second most populated province of Canada and has a big impact on the results of federal elections.
The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois, which focuses on Quebec interests and only runs candidates in the province, was defending 35 seats, a number which changed after boundaries were reviewed. It has lost 13 of them.
The Liberals won back LaSalle-Ãmard-Verdun, which the Bloc took in a by-election last year.
The NDP held on to their seat in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie in Montreal.
Preliminary results saw the Montreal suburb of Terrebonne flip to the Liberals by just 35 votes but, after Elections Canada's vote validation,  Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois held it by 44 votes. 
That result then went to a judicial recount, which found the Liberals had in fact won by one vote.
Turnout has surpassed the levels seen in 2015 and 2019, with 69% of registered electors having voted. This is according to Elections Canada's updated estimates on 7 May.
More than 7 million Canadians cast their ballots in advance, setting a new record for early voter turnout, Elections Canada said.

Hamburg police said on Saturday that four of the victims who had sustained life-threatening injuries were in a stable condition.
Officers arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene of the attack, which took place at about 18:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Friday.
Police said there was ""very concrete evidence"" of mental illness in the suspect, and no evidence the attack was politically motivated.
The woman remains in police custody and is scheduled to appear in court on Saturday.
The attack happened between platforms 13 and 14 - which are accessible via a busy main road - while a train was on one of the platforms.
The suspect began stabbing people waiting for the train, but was stopped by the ""rapid intervention"" of two people on the platform as well as emergency services, police said.
The victims range in age from 19 to 85. Seven people were slightly injured, seven seriously injured, and four critically injured, police said.
The critically injured - a 24-year-old female, 24-year-old male, 52-year-old female, and an 85-year-old female - were stable as of Saturday.
On Saturday police said there was still no evidence of a political motive for the attack. 
""Rather, there is now very concrete evidence of a mental illness on the part of the suspect,"" they said, adding that the woman did not appear to have been under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
An investigation is under way.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack was ""shocking"" and thanked the emergency services for ""their rapid assistance"".
Pictures from the scene on Friday showed emergency service personnel and vehicles and barriers that seem to be hiding the injured from public view.
A video on social media appears to show the suspect with her hands behind her back being escorted out of the station platform by officers who put her in a police vehicle.
Hamburg's central station is one of Germany's busiest transport hubs. It is often crowded during Friday rush hour.
This is the latest in a series of violent attacks in Germany in recent months.
In January, a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man were killed in a stabbing in a park in Aschaffenburg, with several others hurt.
A Spanish tourist was stabbed just a month later at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial.
Last December, six people were killed and hundreds were injured after a car drove into a crowd at a Christmas market in the eastern city of Magdeburg.
The suspects in these previous attacks were migrants, which has led Germany to tighten border control checks and saw immigration become a key issue for voters during the country's federal elections in February."

The European Union's trade chief said the 27-member bloc is committed to securing a trade deal with the US based on ""respect"" not ""threats"".
It comes after US President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 50% tariff on all goods sent to the US from the EU.
""The EU's fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,"" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said after a call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
""EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.""
Earlier on Friday, Trump expressed impatience with the pace of ongoing EU-US trade negotiations, saying his plan to raise tariffs on 1 June was set.
Writing on social media, Trump said: ""Our discussions with [the EU] are going nowhere,"" adding that there would be no tariffs for products built or manufactured in the US.
""I'm not looking for a deal - we've set the deal,"" he told reporters later, before immediately adding that a big investment in the US by a European company might make him open to a delay.
The EU is one of the Washington's largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn (â¬528bn; Â£443bn) in goods last year and buying $370bn worth, US government figures show.
Reacting to Trump's threats, European governments warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides.
""We do not need to go down this road,"" said Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin. ""Negotiations are the best and only sustainable way forward.""
France's Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin, said: ""We are maintaining the same line: de-escalation, but we are ready to respond.""
German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche said the bloc ""must do everything"" to reach a solution with the US.
While Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told reporters that he backed the EU's strategy in trade talks and ""we have seen before that tariffs can go up and down in talks with the US"".
US President Donald Trump in April announced what he called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on goods from countries around the world
The EU is negotiating with the US as a bloc, though Stephen Moore, a former economic advisor to Trump who works for conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, told the BBC: ""What may happen in Europe... is that we may try to negotiate individually with countries in Europe."" 
He added that in his opinion Trump's ""ultimate aim is really to decouple not just the US but the whole world from Chinese influence which would be a very good thing if he could pull that off"". 
In early April, Trump announced tariffs against a long list of countries, including a 20% tax on most EU goods being sold into the US.
Soon afterwards, the president paused the higher tariffs for three months, until 8 July, to allow for more negotiations, but kept a 10% baseline tax in place against the US's trade partners.
Higher US tariffs also remained in place against China though they were substantially lowered. 
Despite the climbdown from Trump, the US kept a 25% tariff against EU steel and aluminium imports in place.
The EU has threatened â and paused â its own measures against the US. It said it would introduce a 25% tariff on â¬18bn ($20bn; Â£15bn) worth of US goods coming into Europe but this has been put on hold.  
It is also currently consulting on additional measures against US imports into the US valued at â¬95bn.
Trump's complaints about Europe have focused on what he claims is an uneven trade relationship - the EU sells more goods to the US than it buys from America.
Trump blames a trade deficit on policies that he claims are unfair to American companies, and he has specifically raised concerns about policies related to cars and agricultural products.
Trump also warned Apple that he would impose a 25% import tax ""at least"" on iPhones not manufactured in America, later widening the threat to any smartphone.
Shares in the US and EU fell on Friday after the latest threats, with America's S&P 500 down about 0.7% and Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 ending the day down more than 1.5%."

A Cessna 550 crashed early Thursday into a residential neighbourhood, burning cars and destroying at least one home. 
Authorities say all six aboard are presumed dead, including a former drummer for the rock band The Devil Wears Prada and a high-profile music agent. 
The National Transportation Safety Board is examining a mix of clues and said the aircraft did not have a flight data recorder, which would have provided more information. Officials have not yet determined what factors led to the crash.
In a news conference on Friday, NTSB investigator Dan Baker said the agency is receiving help from the FBI as it works to collect and preserve evidence from the scene.
He said investigators have found the plane had struck high-tension power lines before crashing into homes in the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood, about two miles from the Montgomery Field Airport - where the plane was heading. 
The airport, a small regional airport with three runways, was experiencing two separate issues at the time of the crash, Mr Baker said. The Automated Surface Observing Station, which provides weather data to pilots, was ""inoperative at the time of the accident due to an unrelated power surge"". 
At the time, foggy conditions had been reported throughout the area. 
Mr Baker attributed the outage to ""some sort of technical glitch"", but cautioned that it is unclear whether this contributed to the crash since not all airports are equipped with this system.
The airport also had filed a notice to pilots called a Notam, informing them that one of the runways had experienced an issue with the lighting system that guides landing planes.
The pilot of the downed plane had been aiming for that runway when the crash occurred, Mr Baker said. 
The pilot did not report any issues to air control and never declared an emergency, Mr Baker said. 
The Cessna was not equipped with a flight data recorder, and officials are investigating whether it may have had a cockpit voice recorder onboard.
The crash happened around 3:45 local time (10:45 GMT) and about 100 people had to be evacuated from the neighbourhood, which is just northeast of the city of San Diego.
Eight people on the ground were injured, including one who was taken to hospital.
A preliminary report from the NTSB is expected to be released within 30 days, with a final report in the next 12 to 24 months.

The names of four of the six people aboard the flight when it crashed have thus far been released. 
Emma Huke, 25, and Kendall Fortner, 24, were named as being on the plane by their employer, Sound Talent Group. 
Fortner ""was the life of the party and lit up any room she entered,"" the company said in a statement on Friday. 
Huke was ""a beautiful soul who brought joy and a light to everyone in her presence"".
The company had earlier confirmed the death of its co-founder, prominent music agent Dave Shapiro. Shapiro had worked with rock groups including Sum 41, Story of the Year, Parkway Drive and singer Vanessa Carlton.
He was also an avid pilot and a certified flight instructor with 15 years of experience, according to his aviation company Velocity Aviation.
Former The Devil Wears Prada drummer Daniel Williams was also killed in the crash, members of the group confirmed in tributes posted online. 
In the hours before the crash, he posted images on Instagram of himself and Shapiro sitting in the cockpit of the plane, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune.
Williams was a founding member of The Devil Wears Prada and part of the Christian metal band for more than 10 years before parting ways in 2016.
The band posted a series of photos of Williams on Instagram, showing him with drumsticks, flying in an aircraft and various moments with fellow bandmates. 
""no words. We owe you everything,"" the post reads. ""Love you forever."""
153,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyvmj6mem70o,2025-05-23 23:22:08,"Can Donald Trump build the 'Golden Dome' over the US?,","Trump said the Golden Dome will be completed by the end of his term. 
Warheads raining down from beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Faster-than-sound cruise missiles striking US infrastructure. Sky-high nuclear blasts.
These are just some of the nightmarish scenarios that experts warn could come true if the US's dated and limited defence systems were overwhelmed in a future high-tech attack.
Even a single, relatively small nuclear detonation hundreds of miles above the heads of Americans would create an electromagnetic pulse - or EMP - that would have apocalyptic results. Planes would fall out of the sky across the country. Everything from handheld electronics and medical devices to water systems would be rendered completely useless.
""We wouldn't be going back 100 years,"" said William Fortschen, an author and weapons researcher at Montreat College in North Carolina. ""We'd lose it all, and we don't know how to rebuild it. It would be the equivalent of us going back 1,000 years and having to start from scratch.""
In response to these hypothetical - but experts say quite possible - threats, US President Donald Trump has set his eyes on a ""next generation"" missile shield: the Golden Dome.
But while many experts agree that building such a system is necessary, its high cost and logistical complexity will make Trump's mission to bolster America's missile defences extremely challenging. 
An executive order calling for the creation of what was initially termed the ""Iron Dome for America"" noted that the threat of next-generation weapons has ""become more intense and complex"" over time, a potentially ""catastrophic"" scenario for the US.
Patrycja Bazylczyk, a missile defence expert at the Washington DC-headquartered Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the BBC that existing systems are geared towards intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs, such as those used by North Korea. But powerful nations like Russia and China are also investing in newer technologies that could strike not just neighbours, but adversaries an ocean away.
Among the threats publicly identified by US defence officials are hypersonic weapons able to move faster than the speed of sound and fractional orbital bombardment systems - also called Fobs - that could deliver warheads from space.
Each - even in limited numbers - are deadly. 
""The Golden Dome sort of re-orients our missile defence policy towards our great power competitors,"" Ms Bazylczyk said. ""Our adversaries are investing in long-range strike capabilities, including things that aren't your typical missiles that we've been dealing with for years."" 
The White House and defence officials have so far provided few concrete details about what the Golden Dome - which is still in its conceptual stages - would actually look like. 
Speaking alongside Trump in the Oval Office on 20 May, defence secretary Pete Hegseth said only that the system will have multiple layers ""across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors"".
Trump added that the system will be capable of intercepting missiles ""even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched in space"", with various aspects of the programme based as far afield as Florida, Indiana and Alaska.
In previous testimony in Congress, the newly named overseer of the programme, Space Force General Michael Guetlein, said that the Golden Dome will build on existing systems that are largely aimed at traditional ICBMs. A new system would add multiple layers that could also detect and defend against cruise missiles and other threats, including by intercepting them before they launch or at the various stages of their flight. 
Currently, the US Missile Defence Agency largely relies on 44 ground-based interceptors based in Alaska and California, designed to combat a limited missile attack. 
Experts have warned that the existing system is woefully inadequate if the US homeland were to be attacked by Russia and China, each of which has an expanded arsenal of hundreds of ICBMs and thousands of cruise missiles. 
""[Current systems] were created for North Korea,"" said Dr Stacie Pettyjohn, a defence expert at the Center for a New American Security. ""It could never intercept a big arsenal like Russia's, or even a much smaller one like China's."" 
The Congressional Research Office, or CBO, has said that ""hundreds or thousands"" of space-based platforms would be necessary to ""provide even a minimal defence"" against incoming missiles  - a potentially enormously expensive proposition. 
Trump first revealed his concept for the Golden Dome during a joint address to Congress in March, when he said that ""Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too"".
The president was referring to Israel's ""Iron Dome"" system, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011.
Israel's Iron Dome, however, is designed to intercept shorter-range threats, while two other systems - known as David's Sling and the Arrow - combat larger ballistic missiles such as those that have been fired by Iran and the Houthis in Yemen. 
Ms Bazylczyk described the Iron Dome as geared towards ""lower tier"" threats, such as rockets fired from Gaza or southern Lebanon. 
The Golden Dome would go beyond that, to detect longer range missiles as well, she said. 
To accomplish that, she said it will need to combine different capabilities.  
""And I'll be looking out for the command and control system that can weave all of this together,"" she said, noting that such a thing does not currently exist.
Creating that system will be an incredibly complicated - and costly - proposition. 
In the Oval Office, Trump suggested that the Golden Dome could be completed by the end of his term, with a total cost of $175bn over time, including an initial investment of $25bn already earmarked for it. 
His estimate is far out of sync with the CBO's, which has put the potential price tag at $542bn over 20 years on the space-based systems alone. Experts have said the total cost could eventually soak up a large chunk of the massive US defence budget. 
""I think that's unrealistic,"" said Dr Pettyjohn. ""This is complicated, with multiple systems that need to be integrated together. Every one of those steps has its own risks, costs and schedules."" 
""And going fast is going to add more cost and risk,"" she added. ""You're likely to produce something that isn't going to be as thoroughly evaluated... there are going to be failures along the way, and what you produce may need major overhauls."" 
The creation of the Golden Dome has also sparked fears that it may lead to a new ""arms race"", with US foes gearing up their own efforts to find ways to overwhelm or circumvent its defences. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning, for example, told reporters that the plan ""heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield"". 
Those involved in researching worst-case scenarios and US defence policy downplay these concerns. Potential foes, they argue, are already investing heavily in offensive capabilities. 
""The Golden Dome aims to change the strategic calculus of our adversaries,"" said Ms Bazylczyk. ""Improving homeland air and missile defences reduces the confidence of a potential attacker in achieving whatever objectives they seek.""
""It raises the threshold for them to engage in this attack,"" she added. ""And it contributes to overall deterrence."" 
Even a partially completed Golden Dome, Mr Fortschen said, could prevent a nightmare scenario from taking place. 
""I will breathe a lot easier,"" he said. ""We need that type of system. The Golden Dome is the answer."""
154,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd62g8pn35yo,2025-05-23 23:11:49,"Remembering the Indian scientist who challenged the Big Bang theory,","Narlikar was a prolific scholar who published over 300 research papers
In his 1983 science fiction story, an Indian astrophysicist predicted what schools would look like in 2050. 
Jayant Narlikar envisioned a scene where an alien, living among humans, would sit in front of a screen and attend online classes. The aliens are yet to manifest, but online classes became a reality for students far sooner, in 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.
Narlikar also famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang Theory - the popular idea that the universe was created in a single moment from a single point. He believed that the universe had always existed, expanding continuously into infinity.
With his passing on Tuesday, India lost one of its most celebrated astrophysicists. Narlikar was 86 - a man far ahead of his times and someone who shaped a generation of Indian researchers through his lifelong dedication to science education.
His funeral was attended by hundreds, from school children to renowned scientists and even his housekeeping staff, underscoring the profound impact he had on society.
Narlikar famously proposed an alternative to the Big Bang theory
Born on 19 July, 1938, in the town of Kolhapur in the western state of Maharashtra, Narlikar was raised in a home steeped in academic tradition. 
His father, Vishnu Narlikar, was a professor and mathematician, and mother Sumati was a scholar of the Sanskrit language.
Following in his parents footsteps, the studious Narlikar went to Cambridge University for higher studies where topped a highly prestigious mathematical course. He also took a deep interest in astrophysics and cosmology.
But his most significant episode at Cambridge was his association with his PhD guide, physicist Sir Fred Hoyle. Together, Narlikar and Hoyle laid the groundwork for a revolutionary alternative to the popular Big Bang theory.
The two physicists contested the Big Bang Theory, which posits that all matter and energy in the universe came into existence in one single instance about 13.8 billion years ago.
The Hoyle-Narlikar theory boldly proposed the continuous creation of new matter in an infinite universe. Their theory was based on what they called a quasi-steady state model.
In his autobiography, My Tale of Four Cities, Narlikar used a banking analogy to explain the theory. 
""To understand this concept better, think of capital invested in a bank which offers a fixed rate of compound interest. That is, the interest accrued is constantly added to the capital which therefore grows too, along with the interest."" 
He explained that the universe expanded like the capital with compound interest. However, as the name 'steady state' implies, the universe always looks the same to the observer.
Astronomer Somak Raychaudhury says that though Narlikar's theory isn't as popular as the Big Bang, it is still useful.
""He advanced mechanisms by which matter could be continually created and destroyed in an infinite universe,"" Raychaudhary said. 
""While the Big Bang model gained broader acceptance, many tools developed for the steady-state model remain useful today,"" he added
Raychaudhary recollects that even after Hoyle began to entertain elements of the Big Bang theory, Narlikar remained committed to the steady-state theory. 
A sign outside his office fittingly stated: ""The Big Bang is an exploding myth.""
Narlikar's reply to a student's letter, written in the Marathi language
Narlikar stayed in the UK till 1971 as a Fellow at King's College and a founding member of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy. 
As he shot to global fame in the astrophysics circles, the science community in India took note of his achievements.
In 1972, he returned to India and immediately took charge of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the coveted Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, which he led it till 1989.
But his biggest contribution to India was the creation of an institution dedicated to cutting-edge research and the democratisation of science.
This dream materialised in 1988, when Narlikar, along with other distinguished scientists, founded the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune city in western India.
From a modest 100sq ft room, IUCAA has gone on to become an internationally respected institution for astronomy and astrophysics. 
Narlikar served as its founder-director till 2003, and continued to be an emeritus professor after that.
He insisted that IUCAA should include programs aimed at school children and the general public. Monthly lectures, science camps, and workshops became regular events.
Recalling Narlikar's vision for the institution, science educator Arvind Gupta says, ""He said PhD scholars don't fall from the sky, you must catch them young. He offered me a place to stay, told me to try running the children's science centre for six months, and I ended up staying 11 years. He gave me wings to fly.""
Despite being a prolific scholar who published over 300 research papers, Narlikar never confined himself to being just a scientist. He also authored many science fiction books that have been translated into multiple languages.
These stories were often grounded in scientific principles.
In a story called Virus, published in 2015, he envisioned a pandemic taking over the world; his 1986 book Waman Parat Na Ala (The Return of Vaman), tackled the ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence.
Sanjeev Dhurandhar, who was part of the Indian team that contributed to the physical detection of gravitational waves in 2015, recalled how Narlikar inspired him to attempt the unthinkable.
""He gave me a complex problem early in my research. After I struggled for a week, he solved it on the board in 15 minutes - not to show superiority, but to guide and inspire. His openness to gravitational waves was what gave me the courage to pursue it.""
A well-known rationalist, Narlikar also took it upon himself to challenge pseudoscience. In 2008, he co-authored a paper that challenged astrology using a statistical method.
Raychaudhary said that his motivation to challenge pseudoscience came from the belief system of questioning everything that did not have a scientific basis. 
But when it came to science, Narlikar believed in exploring the slimmest of possibilities.
In his last days, Narlikar continued doing what he loved most - replying to children's letters and writing about science on his blog."

South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and his delegation went to Washington this week hoping for a boost and a reset after months of acrimony with the Donald Trump administration.
Instead they got brutal, high-stakes diplomacy, peppered with insults, and played out to millions across the world in real time. It was like a painful job review carried out by a boss on a loud hailer.
Praised by many for remaining composed and reconciliatory in the face of an exercised Trump, while also criticised by some for not responding more forcefully to Tump's accusations, reality awaits Ramaphosa back in South Africa where he and his African National Congress (ANC) face pressures on multiple fronts.
The ANC has been in an uneasy coalition - or government of national unity (GNU) - with 10 other parties for almost a year, forced into sharing power after dismal results in national elections.
There have been public fights between parties inside and outside the coalition over controversial land and healthcare legislation and attempts to push a budget through parliament which would hike taxes for the most vulnerable. That almost saw the end of the coalition earlier this year.
The economy is stagnating, crime rates are sky-high as is corruption and unemployment, public services are largely dysfunctional and infrastructure is crumbling. There also seems to be very little accountability for those who break the law. 
This has meant uncomfortable and intense questions about Ramaphosa's policies by various political parties, as well as civil society.
Meanwhile the ANC itself is unstable, as opposing factions begin jockeying for position ahead of a crucial elective conference in 2027 which is likely to see a new party leader emerge.
At the same time, Ramaphosa's loudest critics, such as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema - who featured prominently in Trump's discredited dossier of ""evidence"" that genocide was being committed against white Afrikaners in South Africa - as well as former President Jacob Zuma, have been getting louder still.
South African opposition politician, Julius Malema, featured in Trump's ambush, with the American president showing footage of Malema singing his controversial song - ""Shoot the Boer (Afrikaner), Shoot the farmer""
So Ramaphosa was looking for a trade deal, desperately needing the business and stability this would bring to South Africa to stimulate real and lasting economic growth and put people back to work.
Ramaphosa said as much to Trump on Wednesday - that US investment was needed to help tackle the joblessness that was a key factor in the country's high crime rate.
The risk that the Agoa trade deal with the US may not be renewed later this year because of Trump's isolationist worldview have made this all the more urgent. This gave South Africa duty-free access to the US market for certain goods, and is credited with having boosted South Africa's fragile economy.
But the talk of trade was overshadowed by Trump's Oval Office ambush over discredited claims that white South Africans were being persecuted.
However, there may still be a silver lining for Ramaphosa, and by extension his party, at least domestically. 
Yes, the to-do list is impossibly long, and yes the pressure for the South African president to hold a coalition and party together that is messy and deeply uncomfortable will be waiting for him on his return. And yes the ANC is in the weakest position since it came to power 30 years ago. But it's still in power, even if it's sharing it.
Crucially, Ramaphosa's conduct with Trump reminded South Africans of his diplomatic pedigree, and of his importance to the country's rules-based order.
He is, along with Nelson Mandela, South Africa's greatest ever alliance builder and facilitator. He was at the nerve centre of negotiating an end to the racist system of apartheid in the early 1990s, and in keeping South Africa together when many had prophesised its fatal fracture. He has stayed calm, smiled and faced down far more bitter opponents before.
More recently, he steered the country out of the bleak ""state capture"" years of the Zuma administration and then through the difficult Covid lockdowns. And also kept the ANC on its feet - just - when it hobbled home after the 2024 elections. He then he took a wounded ANC into coalition politics and survived as president despite opposition from within his own party.
""I believe if a snap poll was done today, we would see his personal ratings go up,"" says South African editor and founder of explain.co.za Verashni Pillay. 
""He excels in these high-pressure situations. He has this wealth of negotiating experience in arguably far more tense environments where there has been actual blood on the streets and imminent civil war. That's why you saw him looking particularly relaxed. He's masterful at diffusing tension at key moments.""
Surveys have consistently referenced the Ramaphosa Effect - the most recent, external from the Social Research Foundation last month which suggests that without him, the ANC would haemorrhage support even more than it already has, despite equally consistent criticism of the South African president that he is too slow and indecisive in tackling the country's biggest problems. To a large extent, that's still the case.
Ramaphosa remained relatively composed during his meeting with Trump
But events this week, ostensibly meant to bully, ridicule and embarrass Ramaphosa around the world, actually reminded many South Africans of what he brings to the government and the country - a constant, stable and predictable centre.
Fact-checking Trump's Oval Office confrontation with Ramaphosa
Ramaphosa keeps cool during Trump's choreographed onslaught
On the South African road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by Trump
""I think what happened in the Oval Office has reinforced the idea of 'If not Ramaphosa then who?'"" says Pillay.
In fact, some think that what South Africans saw in the White House will actually strengthen the GNU - backed as it is by big business, which will ultimately reassure South Africans who were watching the drama.
""The meeting displayed a united front from South Africa, a public-private performance that the country has been promoting for over a decade. This for the GNU is great political theatre that translates into political capital,"" says Itumeleng Makgetla, a political analyst at the University of Pretoria.
And indeed, the optics were all there. Ramaphosa facilitated a passionate rebuttal of the worst of Trump's misinformation through interventions from his partner in the GNU - Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen - and one of South Africa's wealthiest people, Johann Rupert - both white South Africans. If Trump understood the power of performance, so too did Ramaphosa.
""I do think the GNU comes out of this looking quite strong,"" says Pillay. ""The GNU happened at a really good moment for South Africa ahead of this crisis. If it was just the ANC government in the room, [Ramaphosa's arguments] wouldn't have landed. But being able to say that we have these parties that represent white people in government is such a strong statement.""
Johann Rupert (left), South Africa's richest man, rebuffed President Trump's claim that white people are being specifically targeted
So what does this all mean for those on the extreme flanks of South African politics and discourse? 
After the lights dimmed, Julius Malema was shown by Trump singing a song that some say calls for the murder of white farmers, although a court has ruled it is just political rhetoric. Might he reap domestic political capital from being thrust into the global spotlight?
Yes, say some. ""For those in the country that are quite tired of the diatribe from President Trump and the USâ¦ this will likely strengthen Malema [and] parties like the MK because it'll basically be saying: 'Look, surely we can't be bending over backwards for such individuals and lies,'"" says South African political analyst Prof Kagiso ""TK"" Pooe from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
But Pillay disagrees. 
""This will not translate into political power for Malema.  Most of his top leaders have already defected to Jacob Zuma's MK party. Things for the EFF were not looking good, even before Wednesday. Julius Malema's brand of politics, of wanting everything to burn down, of blaming white people for everything... is entertaining but it hasn't won votes because most South Africans don't want their country to be burnt down.""
Having said that, there is a sizeable group of South Africans who want faster and more radical change - the election results for the MK party, a breakaway faction of the ANC, shows that.
And what of Afriforum - the Afrikaner interest group that tugged at the ears of Trump's supporters for a number of years by lobbying and spreading right-wing propaganda, hoping to be heard?
Trump's discredited audio-visual presentation of what he said was the systematic extermination of white Afrikaner farmers was the high-water mark of their lobbying efforts, amplified as they were in the Oval Office.
Yet, despite extraordinarily high levels of violent crime in South Africa, many are angry at the group. ""In a way, I think a lot of South Africans - even those that don't support the ANC - can finally see that there are certain people that are not for South Africa. Those people have been singled out and that's a positive in a way,"" says Prof Pooe.
""We know a large number of Afrikaans speakers are people of colour,"" says Pillay. ""Afriforum dealt a severe blow to the cause of Afrikaners in South Africa by racialising it.""
Afriforum's Kallie Kriel has defended the group's conduct on a local television channel, Newzroom Afrika: ""It wasn't Afriforum chanting genocidal calls for someone to be killed. If President Ramaphosa went there to tell the Americans that they don't know what's going on, they will see that as an insult because they have an embassy in South Africa and a State Department and intelligence services,"" he said.
As the dust settles from Wednesday's drama, Ramaphosa will be watching and calculating. He has consistently been at the centre of key inflection points in recent South African history when some kind of a rupture has occurred and the country has had to change course dramatically. He reads these moments so well.
Wednesday's upheaval in Trump's White House may not have been the economic and diplomatic reset with the US that was hoped, but could yet mark a dramatic reset for Ramaphosa and the GNU with the South African public.

Inside the Kremlin walls I'm wandering alone through the vast grounds trying - and failing - to find my way out.
I spot a checkpoint, approach and show my passport.
""Nyet vykhoda!"" [""No exit!""] replies the guard. He points in the opposite direction.
I walk back and, eventually, come to another checkpoint.
""No way out!"" says the sentry.
I'm lost. Inside the Kremlin. In the dead of night.
It's like being in a John le CarrÃ© novel.
It's been quite an evening. I arrived at 5pm. Along with a small group of journalists, I'd been invited to ""an event with President Putin"". What kind of event? To begin with the Kremlin wouldn't say. Eventually we were told Vladimir Putin would be taking questions.
Eight hours later, the president strode into the Malachite Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace and sat at a desk. 
But there'd been a change of plan. No press conference. No questions. Instead, live on Russian TV, Putin delivered a statement in which he proposed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.
Event over, I walk out of the Kremlin Palace but take a wrong turn. Finally, I locate the correct exit and, bleary-eyed, take a taxi home.
This was the start of what has turned out to be a real rollercoaster of a fortnight. What began with a late-night Kremlin statement continued with peace talks in Turkey and then a two-hour telephone call between Putin and Donald Trump.
But, at the end of it, are we any closer to peace in Ukraine?
It doesn't feel like it.
Trump has, in the past, referenced his ""very close relationship"" with Putin, but more recently wondered if he is ""just tapping me along"" on peace talks
Although there is talk about more talks, and of Ð° possible future ""memorandum"" on a ""possible future peace"", it all sounds rather vague.
For now, the fighting goes on.
Russia is still refusing to sign up to an unconditional comprehensive ceasefire. It has no intention of returning any of the Ukrainian land it has seized, occupied and claims to have annexed. On the contrary: it's pushing for more.
Right now, the Ukraine peace process resembles being lost in the Kremlin late at night.
It's hard to see the exit.
And yet the past two weeks have revealed a lot.
First, how Russia neutralises potential threats and pressure points.
Kremlin critics would put this another way: how Russia plays for time.
On 10 May (a few hours before I got lost in the Kremlin), after a phone call with Donald Trump, European leaders had issued an ultimatum to President Putin: agree to an unconditional long-term ceasefire in Ukraine in two days or face crushing new sanctions. 
Since March the Trump administration has been calling on Russia and Ukraine to accept a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire. Kyiv agreed. Moscow hasn't.
The Kremlin leader sidestepped the European ultimatum with his counter proposal of direct talks in Turkey. The idea was greeted with scepticism in Ukraine and across Europe. But it was enough to placate Trump and convince him Russia was serious about wanting peace. He was all for the talks. ""Crushing"" new sanctions were delayed.
Ahead of the Istanbul meeting on 16 May, President Trump gave the impression that Vladimir Putin might attend. The Kremlin leader did not, sending instead a comparatively low-level delegation that once more rejected the idea of a long-term ceasefire. But, again, the modest results of the talks were sufficient to persuade the US president that progress was being made.
Then came the Trump-Putin phone call on 19 May. 
By the end of it, Russia had still not agreed to an immediate comprehensive cessation of hostilities. Instead, according to President Trump, ""Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War"".
But Moscow is already casting doubt on whether it would sign any future peace treaty with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. For a year now the Russian authorities have been attempting to delegitimise Ukraine's president since the expiry of his presidential term. However, Ukraine's Constitution prohibits the holding of elections in wartime.
And the reason for martial law in Ukraine is Russia's invasion.
""Would Russia sit down and sign a peace agreement with President Zelensky?"" I asked Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday.
""You're putting the cart before the horse,"" Mr Lavrov replied. ""First we need to have a deal. When it's agreed, then we will decide. But, as President Putin has said many times, President Zelensky does not have legitimacyâ¦ Probably the best option would be new electionsâ¦""
The Russian media has concluded that, after two weeks of diplomacy, Moscow has strengthened its hand.
""Russia has won the latest round of global poker,"" declared the Izvestia newspaper last week.
""Donald Trump's stance couldn't be more advantageous to Moscow,"" wrote Kommersant. ""In effect he backed Russia's position of 'Talks first, ceasefire later' and refused to strengthen sanctions against Russia.""
A social scientist told Kommersant: ""Donald Trump, at least for now, is our ideological partner on certain issues. His views are much closer to Russia's than to Europe's.""
And the ultra pro-Kremlin Komsomolskaya Pravda had this message for European leaders:
""You were warned. Don't wave threats and ultimatums in the face of the bear. Don't try to impose conditions in talks that have nothing to do with you.
""Just sit in the lobby and breathe in the smell of the new world order.""
Moscow's confidence is also fuelled by the belief that, in Ukraine, it holds the initiative on the battlefield.
Back in 2023 Donald Trump had promised that, if he won the presidency, ""we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settledâ¦ I'll get them both. I know Zelensky, I know Putin. It'll be done within 24 hours, you watch"".
Trump has been in the Oval Office for more than four months now, but the ""horrible war"" goes on.
On rare occasions, he has publicly rebuked the Kremlin and threatened further sanctions. Last month he said: ""â¦there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'""
But there's been no follow-through. The US president appears reluctant to ratchet up the pressure on the Kremlin, instead signalling to Moscow that he's keen to reboot US-Russia relations.
Trump and Zelensky spoke face-to-face on the sideline of Pope Francis's funeral at the Vatican in April
Following the presidents' telephone conversation, Putin's foreign policy advisor Yuri Ushakov, who'd sat in on the call, told journalists: ""Trump spoke rather emotionally about the prospects for [bilateral] relations. Trump sees Russia as one of America's most important partners in trade and economic matters.""
President Trump seems determined to push on with his rapprochement with Russia, whatever happens on Ukraine.
And Moscow senses that.
""President Trump does not link continued US-Russia dialogue to the Ukraine peace process,"" was a headline in the Russian government paper Rossiyskaya Gazeta this week.
That doesn't mean the Kremlin has headed off the danger of additional restrictions completely. The US Senate has threatened tough new sanctions against Russia if Moscow doesn't get serious about diplomacy.
Up to this point the Kremlin has been able to deflect or to sidestep whatever pressure it's come under to make compromises and concessions regarding its war on Ukraine.
It seems confident it will continue to do so."

The ruling came after Harvard filed a lawsuit - the latest escalation of a dispute between the White House and one of America's most prestigious institutions. 
The university said the administration's decision on Thursday to bar international students was a ""blatant violation"" of the law and free speech rights.
The Trump administration says Harvard has not done enough to fight antisemitism, and change its hiring and admissions practices â allegations that the university has strongly denied.
US District Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order in a short ruling issued on Friday. 
The order pauses a move that the Department of Homeland Security made on Thursday to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) - a government database that manages foreign students.
The next hearing will occur on 29 May in Boston.
""With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard's student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,"" Harvard argued in the lawsuit.
""We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,"" Harvard President Alan Garber said in a letter.
'We did not sign up for this': Harvard's foreign students are stuck and scared
""The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government's illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,"" he wrote.
In response, White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson said: ""If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with. 
After the restraining order was issued, Ms Jackson accused the judge in the case of having a ""liberal agenda"". 
""These unelected judges have no right to stop the Trump Administration from exercising their rightful control over immigration policy and national security policy,"" she said. 
It was quiet at Harvard on Friday. Classes have finished for the year and preparations are being made for commencements. Gazebos were going up on the quad as students rented their gowns and collected tickets for family members. 
For those graduating, it should be a week of celebration. But for foreign students hoping to remain in the US, it's been a 24-hour whirlwind.
All morning Harvard's international student body scrambled to find out what was going to happen. Would they have to leave the US immediately? Were they now under the threat of deportation?
Cormac Savage from Downpatrick in Co Down Northern Ireland is six days from graduating with a degree in government and languages. He's taking a job in Brussels, partly because of the uncertainty in the US.
""You know that you're fine if you're still legally in the United States for the next 90 days, but you don't know that you can come back and finish your degree,"" he said on Friday. ""You don't know if you can stay and work in the US if you're about to graduate.
The order also complicates plans for students still enroled, like Rohan Battula, a junior from the UK who will rely on his visa to work in New York in June.
""I was worried if I went home I wouldn't get to come back,"" he told BBC, so he opted to stay on campus. 
For a group of international students gathered on the banks of the Charles River, as rowing teams sculled by, the relief was palpable when news came in of the reprieve from the Boston court.
Mr Battula also felt relieved after Judge Burroughs issued her order. But the uncertainty still is taking a toll. 
""It's surreal to think that even for some period of time you're unlawfully staying in a country, just because you've been to university there,"" Mr Battula said.
There are around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolled students this year.
Around a fifth of them are from China, with significant numbers from Canada, India, South Korea and the UK. Among the international students currently enrolled is the future queen of Belgium, 23-year-old Princess Elisabeth. 
Leo Ackerman was set to study education and entrepreneurship at Harvard beginning in August, fulfilling a ""dream"".
""I was really excited, and I'm still really excited if I manage to go there,"" Mr Ackerman said. ""Having it taken away feels like a really sad moment for a lot of people.""
Eliminating foreign students would take a large bite out of Harvard's finances. Experts say international students are more likely to pay full tuition, essentially subsidising aid for American students. 
Undergraduate tuition - not including fees, housing, books, food or health insurance - will reach $59,320 (Â£43,850) in the coming academic year, according to the university. The total cost of a year at Harvard before any financial aid is usually significantly more than $100,000.
Isaac Bangura, a public administration student from Sierra Leone, moved to  Harvard with his wife and two young daughters after surviving a civil war.
""Since yesterday, my kids has been asking, 'Daddy, I understand they are coming to return us home again.' They are referring to deportation,"" he said.
He said he has to be strong for them and has faith. ""I know the American people are always, whenever they are into issues, they will find ways of resolving it,"" he said.
In addition to Harvard, the Trump administration has taken aim at other elite institutions, not only arguing that they should do more to clamp down on pro-Palestinian activists but also claiming they discriminate against conservative viewpoints.
On Friday, speaking from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said, ""Harvard is going to have to change its ways"" and suggested he is considering measures against more universities. 
In April, the White House froze $2.2bn (Â£1.7bn) in federal funding to Harvard, and Trump has threatened to remove the university's tax-exempt status, a standard designation for US educational institutions. 
The funding freeze prompted an earlier Harvard lawsuit, also asking the courts to stop the administration's actions.
Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, said federal courts in Massachusetts and New England, where the initial stages of the case will play out, have consistently ruled against the Trump administration. 
But the outcome may be less predictable in the US Supreme Court, where Harvard's case may end up. 
""These are tough issues for Harvard, but they have the resources and they seem to have the will to fight,"" Mr Tobias said. 
Harvard leaders have made concessions to the White House - including dismissing the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, who came under fire for failing to represent Israeli perspectives. 
But it also enlisted several high-profile Republican lawyers, including Robert Hur, a former special counsel who investigated Joe Biden's retention of classified documents.
Foreign students currently attending Harvard have expressed worries that the row  could force them to transfer to another university or return home. Being logged on the SEVP system is a requirement for student visas and, if Harvard is blocked from the database, students could be found in violation and potentially face deportation. 
Several British students enrolled at Harvard, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity out of fear of immigration authorities, worried their US education could be cut short. 
""I definitely think freedom of speech is a problem on campus, but it's being actively worked on... it was an absolute shock when yesterday's announcement happened,"" said one student
""There's a lot of anger, people feeling like we're being used as pawns in a game.""

As soon as Magnus MÃ¦land became mayor of a small town on Norway's northern tip in late 2023, three delegations from China came knocking on his door.
""It's because they want to be a polar superpower,"" he tells me.
China might not instinctively spring to mind when you think about the Arctic - but it's determined to be a big Arctic player. It's been vying to buy real estate, get involved in infrastructure projects and hopes to establish a permanent regional presence.
China already describes itself as a ""near-Arctic state"", even though its northernmost regional capital Harbin is on roughly the same latitude as Venice, Italy.
But the Arctic is fast becoming one of the most hotly-contested parts of the world. Beijing faces stiff competition from Russia, Europe, India and the US.
The race for the Arctic is on.
Climate scientists say the Arctic is warming four times faster than anywhere else. This impacts ecosystems, wildlife and local populations. The Arctic is enormous, encompassing 4% of the globe.
But global powers see a new world of opportunities opening up in the Arctic on the back of environmental changes.
The melting ice in the Arctic makes it easier to access the region's incredible natural resources - critical minerals, oil, and gas - around 30% of untapped natural gas is said to be found in the Arctic.
And it's opening up possibilities for new maritime trade routes, drastically reducing travel time between Asia and Europe. In the export business, time is money. China has been developing a ""Polar Silk Road"" plan for Arctic shipping. 
Kirkenes hopes to be the first European stop for Chinese cargo ships in the future, but is wary of allowing Beijing too much influence in the port
When I visit, the port of Kirkenes looks pretty ghostly.
Inside the Arctic Circle, at the northernmost point of mainland Norway, the former mining town is a gritty contrast with the picture-postcard, snow-covered mountains and fjords that surround it.
There are shuttered shops and abandoned warehouses, riddled with broken windows. The town feels forgotten and left behind.
So you can imagine the appeal of possibly becoming the first European port of call for masses of container ships from Asia, depending on how fast the polar ice continues to melt.
The town's port director, Terje JÃ¸rgensen, plans to build a brand new international port. His eyes light up when he talks about becoming the Singapore of Europe's High North.
""What we're trying to build here in Kirkenes is a trans-shipment port where three continents meet: North America, Europe and Asia. We'll take the goods ashore and reload onto other vessels [for further export]. We don't need to sell any land to anyone. Not to a UK company, not a Chinese company.
New laws in Norway prohibit the transfer of property or businesses, if the sale could harm ""Norwegian security interests"", he says. What they're waiting for, he adds, are clear guidelines from the government about what kind of critical infrastructure this might cover.
Mayor MÃ¦land certainly seems wary of China's intentions. ""We want a relationship with China, but we don't want to be dependent on China,"" he tells me.
""Europe has to ask itself 'How dependent do you want to be on totalitarian and authoritarian regimes?'""
China's purchase-your-way-into-the-Arctic approach is beginning to be rejected across the European Arctic. Recent attempts by Beijing to buy into seaports in Norway and Sweden and an airport in Greenland, for example, were rebuffed.
This is pushing polar-hungry China - the biggest emerging superpower in the world - into the arms of the Arctic's largest player, Russia.
The border town of Kirkenes has felt the economic impact of the war in Ukraine, with Russian visitors disappearing and cross-border trade almost gone
Russia controls a whopping half of the Arctic shoreline - and it's been hoovering up Chinese investments.
The two countries cooperate militarily in the Arctic too. China's coastguard entered the Arctic for the first time in October, in a joint patrol with Russian forces. The two countries had staged joint military exercises here the month earlier. In July, long-range bombers from both countries provocatively patrolled the Arctic Ocean near Alaska in the United States.
It's as if Beijing and Moscow are looking over at Nato, which has stepped up its exercises in the Arctic, and are saying: We can do this too.
Every country bordering the Arctic is a member of Nato except Russia. Finland and Sweden joined after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Andreas Ãsthagen, a senior fellow at the independent Fridtjof Nansen Institute, describes the Arctic as ""low-hanging fruit"" for Russian-Chinese collaboration.
""Russia needs investments and commercial actors who are interested in developing the Arctic - LNG [liquefied natural gas] resources, oil resources, or developing a northern sea route as a shipping lane. 
""China is that market. The two countries are looking for ways to expand their political, economic, even military cooperation.""
But China is keen not to align itself too closely with Russia. It wants to avoid Western sanctions and to continue doing business with Western powers, inside and outside the Arctic.
Russia has reservations too.
""Be careful not to overrate the Russia-China relationship,"" says Mr Ãsthagen. ""Russia remains wary of letting China too deep into its Arctic.""
Moscow relies heavily on its natural resources there. And it's courting other Arctic investors too, including the US, according to reports.
The view across the Pasvik River to Russia, marked by a yellow border post on the largely unguarded Norwegian side
Russia also relies on its Arctic to store strategic weapons - mainly on its Kola peninsula, which bristles with nuclear capabilities and is home to its legendary Northern Fleet.
Back in Norway, Kirkenes residents live under that shadow of the Russian Bear next door. They always have. The border with Russia is a 10 minutes drive away by car. And Kola peninsula feels uncomfortably close.
In Cold War times, the town became known as a nest of spies - a frontline between the West and the Soviet Union.
Norway believes Russia is using its Arctic to train new recruits to fight, and to fly bombers from, to attack Ukraine.
Though not directly at war with Russia, Norway, and specifically the north of the country along its roughly 200km long land border, feels under attack.
""We see it here locally,"" says Col JÃ¸rn Kviller, speaking to me by the clear waters of the Pasvik River that separates Norway and Russia. Just in front of us are Norway's bright yellow, and Russia's red and green, border posts.
Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there have been increasingly frequent incidents of GPS jamming that have even caused commercial pilots to change navigation systems. Cases of espionage by the border - ""everything from signals intelligence to agents being sent to Norway"" - have shot up, Col Kviller tells me.
Norway and its Nato allies are also on the alert for Russian spy submarines and other vessels in the Arctic.
I'm able to see how Norway monitors this threat, after we get high security clearance to enter the country's Cold War-era joint military command. It's deep inside a quartz mountain in BodÃ¸, within the Arctic Circle.
We find a labyrinth of tunnels and surveillance rooms where Norway gathers real-time intelligence from land, air and sea, focused on suspicious-looking vessels in and near its Arctic waters. Everything is shared in real-time with Nato allies.
Crucially, any Russian vessel wanting to enter Europe has to pass through Norwegian waters first.
Agents in the mountain HQ are on the lookout for signs of espionage and sabotage around what officials call underwater ""critical infrastructure"" as part of the Kremlin's hybrid warfare against the West.
Targets include undersea communications cables - connecting continents and permitting trillions of dollars' worth of financial transactions a day - and also oil and gas pipelines.
Norway is a major supplier of natural gas to Europe, including the UK, especially since sanctions were imposed on Russian exports following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow has been modernising its military capabilities in the Arctic. It has a serious fleet of spy and nuclear submarines. If they pass undetected, they could potentially target missiles at capitals across Europe and also threaten the US.
Intelligence officers monitor Russian movements in Arctic waters from the military headquarters inside a mountain
Norwegian military commanders still hold a weekly contact call with their opposite numbers in Moscow.
US President Donald Trump has told Europe it must do more for its own defence, but inside the Arctic, there is a ""great overlap of interests"", says the chief of the Norwegian joint headquarters Vice Adm Rune Andersen.
""This is also about US homeland defenceâ¦ The Russian concentration of nuclear weapons, the capabilities that Russia is deploying are not only aimed at Europe, but also at the US,"" he says.
Vice Adm Andersen doesn't believe any party is courting open conflict in the Arctic but with global tensions rising elsewhere, such as over Ukraine, the potential for spillover in the Arctic is there.
The vice admiral's team schedules a routine call to Russia's Northern Fleet every Wednesday afternoon -to keep communication channels open, they say. Just in case.

If you leave Kirkenes and head towards the North Pole, you come across the magnificent Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard at about the half-way mark. It's home to ice floes, glaciers and more polar bears than people.
Svalbard is at the heart of the scramble between global powers for Arctic resources. While Norwegian, the archipelago is governed by a treaty allowing people from all countries that signed it to work there visa-free. Most are employed in mines, tourism and scientific research.
That may sound harmonious, but since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there's been a noticeable flexing of nationalist muscles in some communities here. 
They include military parades by the Russian settlement to mark their commemorations for the end of World War Two, the flying of a Soviet flag over Russian infrastructure, and growing suspicion that the Chinese have made their Svalbard research station dual-purpose - for military espionage.
Regardless of whether or not that's true, local mayor Terje Aunevik says it would be naÃ¯ve to suggest there was no intelligence-gathering going on in the different countries' research centres.
""Of course there is... I think the world has been gripped by Arctic fomo [fear of missing out].""
The day I arrive in Svalbard, it's Norway's national day. The streets are thronging with a snaking parade of mums, dads and children from the local school, clad in Norwegian national dress.
Longyearbyen is the northernmost town in the world. Bright sunshine glints off the Arctic waters below the main street, and the flat-topped, snow and ice-covered mountains all around.
Everywhere I look, I see shop windows, prams and women's hairdos festooned with blue, white and red Norwegian flags. Perhaps I imagined it, but among all the cheeriness, it felt like there was another, unspoken sentiment that day, a reminder: 'Svalbard belongs to us!'
The rising mood of national rivalries in the Arctic is not without consequences.

Indigenous communities in the region, just over half of whom live in the Russian Arctic, often feel that there is a failure on the part of those in power to acknowledge the rights of the peoples who have long called the region home.
Miyuki Daorana, a youth activist from Greenland representing the Inughuit indigenous community, says when Donald Trump claimed he wanted to buy the country during his first presidency, they laughed it off. But this time it feels different, she says.
""Because of the current global political situation, with power play and competition for resources, it's much more serious.""
She, and others in the indigenous communities, accuse European countries of using the ""climate crisis"" as an excuse to ""extract and invade indigenous lands"".
""It's something we call green colonialism or developmental aggression where they really want to just take more and more from lands,"" she says.
""[The Arctic] is not just a topic for us. It's not just an interest, it's not a study. It's literally our lives and real struggles and emotions and very unfair injustices.
""The government and the politicians, they're supposed to work for the people. But I haven't seen that. It's mostly diplomatic words.""
Not long ago, you used to hear talk of Arctic exceptionalism, where the eight countries bordering the Arctic - Canada, Russia, the US, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland - along with representatives of six Arctic indigenous communities and other observer countries, including China and the UK, would put aside political differences to work together to protect and govern this incredible part of the world.
But these are times now of big power politics. Countries increasingly act in their own interests.
With so many rival nations now in the Arctic, the risks of misinterpretation or miscalculation are high."
159,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mr9ppn33po,2025-05-23 22:17:29,"Her daughter was taken and sent abroad - 44 years later, they found each other,","Han Tae-soon had spent decades looking for her daughter Kyung-ha
The last memory Han Tae-soon has of her daughter as a child is in May 1975, at their home in Seoul.
""I was going to the market and asked Kyung-ha, 'Aren't you coming?' But she told me, 'No, I'm going to play with my friends',"" recalled Ms Han. 
""When I came back, she was gone.""
Ms Han would not see her daughter again for more than four decades. When they reunited, Kyung-ha was almost unrecognisable as a middle-aged American woman named Laurie Bender.
Kyung-ha had been kidnapped near her home, brought to an orphanage, then sent illegally to the US to be raised by another family, alleges Ms Han, who is now suing the South Korean government for failing to prevent her daughter's adoption.
She is among the hundreds of people who have come forward in recent years with damning allegations of fraud, illegal adoptions, kidnapping and human trafficking in South Korea's controversial overseas adoption programme.
No other country has sent as many children abroad for adoption, and for so long, as South Korea. Since the programme began in the 1950s, about 170,000 to 200,000 children have been adopted overseas - most of them in the West.
In March, a landmark inquiry found that successive governments had committed human rights violations with their lack of oversight, allowing private agencies to ""mass export"" children for profit on an industrial scale.
Experts say the findings could open the door to more lawsuits against the government. Ms Han's is set to go to court next month.
It is one of two landmark cases. Ms Han is the first biological parent of an overseas adoptee seeking damages from the government, while in 2019, a man who was adopted in the US was the first adoptee to sue, external.
A government spokesman told the BBC that it ""deeply sympathises with the emotional pain of individuals and families who could not find each other for a long time"". 
It added that it considered Ms Han's case with ""deep regret"" and that it would take ""necessary actions"" based on the outcome of the trial.
Ms Han, 71, told the BBC she is determined the government takes responsibility.
""I spent 44 years ruining my body and mind searching for [my daughter]. But in all that time, has anyone ever apologised to me? No one. Not once.""
For decades, she and her husband visited police stations and orphanages, put up flyers, and went on television appealing for information. Ms Han said she spent all day pounding the streets looking for her daughter ""till all 10 of my toenails fell out"".
Over the years she thought she came close. In 1990, after one of her TV appeals, Ms Han met a woman who she believed could be Kyung-ha, and even took her in to live with her family for a while. But the woman eventually confessed she was not her daughter.
A breakthrough finally happened in 2019 when Ms Han signed up with 325 Kamra, external, a group that connects overseas Korean adoptees with their birth parents by matching their DNA.
They soon reported a match - Laurie Bender, a nurse in California. After several phone calls, she flew over to Seoul to meet Ms Han, where the two had a tearful reunion at the airport.
Ms Han met her daughter again at Seoul's airport in 2019
Ms Han ran her hands through her daughter's hair at their first reunion
As they embraced, Ms Han ran her fingers through Kyung-ha's hair. ""I've been a hairdresser for 30 years. I can quickly tell if it's my daughter just by feeling her hair. I had mistakenly thought I found her before, so I had to touch and feel the hair to confirm it,"" she said.
The first thing she told her daughter was ""I'm so sorry"".
""I felt guilty because she couldn't find her way home when she was a child. I kept thinking about how much she must have searched for her motherâ¦ Meeting her after all those years made me realise how much she must have longed for her mother, and it broke my heart.""
""It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,"" Kyung-ha said about their reunion in an earlier interview with the Associated Press.  She did not respond to the BBC's requests for an interview.
The pair eventually pieced together what happened on that day in May 1975.
Kyung-ha, who was six years old at the time, was playing near her home when she was approached by a strange woman claiming to know her mother. Kyung-ha was told her mother ""didn't need"" her any more and was taken to a train station.
After taking a train ride with the woman, Kyung-ha was abandoned at the final stop, where she was eventually picked up by police officers and placed in an orphanage. Soon, she was flown to the US to be adopted by a couple in Virginia. 
Years later, checks revealed she was given false papers stating she was an abandoned orphan whose parents were unknown.
""It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true,"" Kyung-ha said previously.
Her case was far from an isolated one.
South Korea's overseas adoption programme began in the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War, when it was a deeply impoverished country with an estimated 100,000 orphaned and displaced children.
At that time, few families were willing to adopt non-biological children, and the government began an overseas adoption programme, billed as a humanitarian effort.
The programme was handled entirely by private adoption agencies. While they were under government oversight, over time these agencies gained significant autonomy through laws.
As their power grew, so did the number of children being sent abroad, rising in the 1970s and peaking in the 1980s. In 1985 alone, more than 8,800 children were sent overseas.
There was a massive demand from the West - with declining birth rates and fewer babies to adopt at home, families began seeking children elsewhere.
Photos from that era show planes heading to Western countries filled with Korean children, with swaddled babies strapped to seats â what the truth and reconciliation commission's inquiry called the ""mass transportation of children like cargo"".
The report alleges little care was taken of these children during these long flights. In one case it cited from 1974, a lactose-intolerant child was fed milk in transit and subsequently died upon arrival in Denmark.
Critics of the programme have long questioned why so many children needed to be sent overseas at a time when South Korea was already experiencing rapid economic growth.
A 1976 BBC Panorama documentary, which featured South Korea as one of several Asian countries sending children to the West, quoted an observer describing the situation as ""out of control"" and ""almost like a trade in childrenâ¦ flowing from Asia into Europe and North America"".
According to the truth and reconciliation report, foreign adoption agencies set quotas for children, which Korean agencies willingly fulfilled. 
It was a profitable business - the lack of government regulation allowed the Korean agencies to charge large amounts and demand hidden fees termed as ""donations"".
The commission's report included this photo of babies strapped into plane seats obtained from a Danish adoption centre's 1984 annual report
Some of these children may have been obtained by unscrupulous means, with parents like Ms Han alleging their children were kidnapped. In the 1970s and 1980s, thousands of homeless or unattended children were rounded up and put in orphanages or welfare centres as part of a national campaign to ""clean up the streets"" of South Korea.
Other parents were told their babies had fallen sick and died, when they were actually alive and taken to adoption agencies. Agencies also did not obtain proper consent from birth mothers to take their children for adoption, according to the truth and reconciliation report.
The report also stated that adoption agencies deliberately falsified information in adoption records to cut corners and quickly meet the demand for children.
Lost children who were found without any identity documents would be made to appear, in paperwork, as if they had been abandoned and put up for adoption.
If a child intended for adoption had died or was reclaimed by their birth parents, another child would be swapped in and assigned the original child's identity. This allowed agencies to avoid refunding adoption fees and expedite the adoption process.
Decades on, this has created immense difficulties for many overseas adoptees trying to track down their biological parents. 
Some have wrong or missing information in their adoption records, while others have discovered they were given entirely false identities.
""We are victims of state violence but there is no trace of this - literally. This lack of documents must not make us victims for the second time,"" said Han Boon-young, co-founder of an overseas adoptee rights group campaigning for greater access to birth information.
""This is a human rights issue. There were kidnappings, falsified documents - all of which were examples of violations committed during the inter-country adoption process.
""It is really necessary to move towards reconciliation, that we recognise these experiences, and that the people who committed these violations be held responsible.""
But some of the key players continue to stay silent or deny wrongdoing.
The BBC contacted Bu Chung-ha, who in the 1970s served as chairman of Holt Children's Services of Korea, South Korea's largest adoption agency.
Holt Children's Services of Korea is at the centre of numerous allegations of fraud and illegal adoptions, and the subject of two lawsuits so far, including Ms Han's.
In a brief reply, Mr Bu denied that the agency had sent abroad any children wrongly identified as orphans during his tenure. Any parents alleging their children were kidnapped ""did not lose their children, they abandoned them"", he said.
The current management of Holt Children's Services of Korea has yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment.
Experts say the responsibility lay not only with the private agencies but also with the state.
""Adoption agencies exploited the system, and the government turned a blind eye - allowing illegal practices to take root,"" said Dr Lee Kyung-eun, an international law scholar at Seoul National University.
""The government was the captain, and the agencies rowed the boat,"" said Shin Pil-sik, a researcher on transnational adoption at Seokyeong University, who added that this structure enabled both sides to deflect accountability.
Dr Shin said the state was not a passive observer- it actively shaped adoption policy, setting annual quotas for overseas placements and even on occasion halted some  adoptions.
An Associated Press news investigation last year, external found successive Korean governments had rewritten laws to remove minimal safeguards and judicial oversight, fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable, and allowed foreign families to adopt Korean children quickly without ever visiting the country.
While the government billed the programme as a humanitarian effort, observers say it also served to strengthen ties with Western countries.
A 1984 government document obtained by the BBC stated that the official goals of the adoption policy included not only the welfare of children but also ""the promotion of future national strength and people-to-people diplomacy"".
When asked about the state's role in past adoption practices, South Korea's health and welfare ministry said they were ""continuing efforts to strengthen state responsibility"" in the system and that it plans to promote adoptions that comply with international standards.
In 2012, the government revised adoption laws to tighten screening of potential adoptive parents, and to track birthparent data and birth information better.
It has also enacted reforms to the adoption system, external ensuring that overseas adoptions are minimised and that all adoptions would be handled by the government instead of private agencies. The changes will take effect in July.
Meanwhile, overseas adoptions have declined. In the late 1980s, overseas adoptions dropped sharply, before stabilising in the 1990s and dropping again in the 2010s. Only 79 children were adopted abroad in 2023, according to the latest available data.
But as South Korea begins to address this dark chapter in its past, adoptees and birth parents like Ms Han continue to struggle with their trauma.
Ms Han spends hours every day practising her English so she can better communicate with her daughter
Ms Han has been practising the phrases ""I'm so sorry"" and ""confused""
After their initial reunion, Ms Han and Kyung-ha have struggled to maintain a close connection.
Not only do they live on opposite sides of the world, her daughter has forgotten most of her Korean while Ms Han knows little English.
They keep in touch over texts occasionally, and Ms Han spends two hours every day practising her English by writing phrases in an exercise book.
But it isn't enough for Ms Han.
""Even though I have found my daughter, it doesn't feel like I've truly found her. All I know is where she is, but what good is that, if we can't even communicate?
""My entire life has been ruinedâ¦ no amount of money will ever make up for what I've lost.""
Update 28 May 2025: A previous version of this story incorrectly named Holt International as the agency that is subject to Han Tae-soon's lawsuit, as well as the agency that the BBC contacted for comment. This has been corrected to Holt Children's Services of Korea. The two agencies are separate entities."

Eight people have been found guilty after US reality TV star Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint of millions of dollars' worth of jewellery in Paris nearly a decade ago.
The four who took part in the heist were given sentences of up to eight years, mostly suspended, and they will not return to prison because of time served. Two people were acquitted.
Nine men and one woman were accused of carrying out or aiding the armed burglary of $10m (Â£7.55m) worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring, during Paris Fashion Week in 2016.
""The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family,"" Kardashian said in a statement after the verdicts.
""While I'll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all.""
Kardashian's lawyers said in a statement she ""looks forward to putting this tragic episode behind her, as she continues working to improve the criminal justice system on behalf of victims, the innocent and the incarcerated seeking to redeem themselves"".
On the night between 3 and 4 October 2016, as Kardashian was in her room at the Hotel de Pourtales in central Paris, a gang of men made their way into the building.
DNA evidence for Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, and Yunice Abbas, 71, placed them at the scene of the crime, and the two have admitted their involvement.
Khedache, who is now disabled, deaf and mute, was sentenced to eight years in prison on Friday, five of which were suspended. 
Due to time already served, he will not return to prison - like all the others convicted.
Abbas, who has Parkinson's disease and recently underwent heart surgery, was sentenced to seven years jail with five suspended, alongside Didier Dubreucq. 
The fourth member of the robbery gang, Marc-Alexandre Boyer, 35, was given the same sentence.
With most of those convicted now in their 60s and 70s, the group has been dubbed the ""Grandpa robbers"" by French media.
But since the beginning of the trial in April, both prosecutors and civil parties have vigorously pushed back against notions the robbers were harmless. 
Prosecutor general Anne-Dominique Merville had urged the jury not to be swayed by their age and health conditions, describing the defendants as ""seasoned robbers"" when they carried out the heist. 
But the sentences handed out on Friday were much lower than prosecutors were seeking.
""The sentences are quite lenient; I understand that you understand that you have caused harm,"" Judge David De Pas told the defendants as he delivered the verdicts.
He said that ""the state of health of the main protagonists ethically prohibits incarcerating anyone"". 
He added: ""It would have been unjust to take you to prison this evening.""
Kardashian told the court earlier this month that she forgave Khedache after receiving a letter of apology from him. 
""I do appreciate the letter for sure. I do appreciate it, I forgive you,"" she said.
During the trial, Kardashian recounted the events of that evening. 
She said she retired to her hotel room at around 03:00 when two masked gunmen wearing police uniforms burst in, dragging with them the hotel's receptionist who had been bound and gagged.
She managed to call her bodyguard before one of the men then took her phone off her. 
They snatched her engagement ring, which had been lying on the bedside table, and then ""picked me up off the bed and grabbed me and took me down the hallway to look for more jewellery"".
One of the men held a gun to her back and she was thrown onto the bed, her hands bound with zip ties. 
At this point, she told the concierge: ""Please translate to them that I have babies, I have to make it home.""
One of the men then pulled her towards him, which opened her robe, under which she wasn't wearing anything.
She told the court she was afraid she was going to be raped, but then her legs were tied together. 
A gun was pointed at her and she said she believed she was going to die.
The robbers then took the jewellery and dashed out of the suite, leaving Kardashian in the bathroom. 
After managing to free herself with the help of her friend and stylist Simone Harouche, she ran out onto the balcony to call for help. 
Kardashian said she was worried the men would return, and that when Parisian police turned up, she couldn't trust them because the robbers had also been wearing police uniforms."

The remains of a bomb disposal specialist who was killed in Ukraine have been repatriated to the Isle of Man.
Chris Garrett died in an incident in Izyum, in the east of the country, on 6 May.
The 40-year-old was volunteering with the Ukraine National Guard, after previously helping in the country in both 2014 and 2017. He returned again when war broke out in February 2022.
Veteran Jim Quinn, who organised a cavalcade to escort Mr Garrett to his home town of Peel, said ""taking him down through his home town one last time"" was a ""privilege and an honour"".
Mr Garrett had been working to clear mines and train Ukrainian troops after co-founding a humanitarian and mine clearance charity called Prevail Together.
Mr Quinn served in the Royal Corps of Signals in the British Army for 14 years, including tours of Bosnia and Afghanistan.
He said: ""The respect and admiration that Chris has out in Ukraine is mirrored here within both the Ukrainian community and the Manx community.""
The veteran first met the bomb disposal specialist in 2014, later joining him in Ukraine for two missions delivering humanitarian aid in Kyiv.
Mr Garrett's remains were met with a guard of honour, with members of his family also present.
The Moddey Dhoo Motorcycle Club then led the cavalcade from Ballasalla to Peel on the west coast of the island.
Chairman Brian Corrie said: ""It's an honour to be able to do something to help the family.""
He added that one of their members also served in Ukraine with Mr Garrett, and was among those taking part.

This week's diplomatic assault has taken many forms, not all of them foreseen.
From concerted international condemnation of Israel's actions in Gaza, to the shocking murder of two young Israeli embassy staff members in Washington, this has been, to put it mildly, a tumultuous week for the Jewish state.
The waves started crashing on Israel's shores on Monday evening, when Britain, France and Canada issued a joint statement condemning its ""egregious"" actions in Gaza.
All three warned of the possibility of ""further concrete actions"" if Israel continued its renewed military offensive and failed to lift restrictions on humanitarian aid.
They also threatened ""targeted sanctions"" in response to Israel's settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.
A statement from 24 donor nations followed, condemning a new, Israeli-backed aid delivery model for Gaza.
But that was just the start.
On Tuesday, Britain suspended trade talks with Israel and said a 2023 road map for future cooperation was being reviewed.
A fresh round of sanctions was imposed on Jewish settlers, including Daniela Weiss, a prominent figure who featured in Louis Theroux's recent documentary, The Settlers.
Israel's ambassador in London, Tzipi Hotovely, was summoned to the Foreign Office, a move generally reserved for the representatives of countries like Russia and Iran.
To make matters worse for Israel, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said a ""strong majority"" of the bloc's members favoured reviewing the 25-year-old Association Agreement with Israel.
The reasons for this flurry of diplomatic condemnation seemed clear enough.
Evidence that Gaza was closer to mass starvation than at any time since the war began, following Hamas's attack in October 2023, was sending ripples of horror across the world.
Israel's military offensive, and the rhetoric surrounding it, suggested that conditions in the stricken territory were about to deteriorate once more.
Addressing MPs on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy singled out the words of Israel's hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who had spoken of ""cleansing"" Gaza, ""destroying what's left"" and relocating the civilian population to third countries.
""We must call this what it is,"" Lammy said. ""It's extremism. It is dangerous. It is repellent. It is monstrous. And I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.""
Smotrich is not a decision-maker when it comes to conduct of the war in Gaza. Before now, his incendiary remarks might have been set to one side.
But those days appear to be over. Rightly or wrongly, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen as in thrall to his far-right colleagues. Critics accuse him of relentlessly pursuing a war, without regard for the lives of Palestinian civilians or the remaining Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.
Countries that have long supported Israel's right to defend itself are beginning to say ""enough is enough.""
This week was clearly a significant moment for Britain's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a staunch defender of Israel (he once said ""I support Zionism without qualification"") who faced strong criticism from within the Labour Party for his reluctance last year to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.
On Tuesday, Sir Keir said the suffering of innocent children in Gaza was ""utterly intolerable"".
In the face of this unusually concerted action from some of his country's strongest allies, Netanyahu reacted furiously, suggesting Britain, France and Canada were guilty of supporting Hamas.
""When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice,"" he posted on X.
""You're on the wrong side of humanity and you're on the wrong side of history.""
Keir Starmer said that children's suffering in Gaza was ""utterly intolerable""
Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar went further, suggesting there was a ""direct line"" between Israel's critics, including Starmer, and Wednesday night's killing of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, the two Israeli embassy employees gunned down outside the Jewish Museum in Washington.
But despite the outpourings of sympathy following the shooting, the Israeli government seems increasingly isolated, with western allies and prominent members of the Jewish diaspora all voicing anger â and anguish â over the war in Gaza.
Lord Levy, former Middle East envoy and advisor to Tony Blair, said he endorsed the current government's criticisms, even suggesting they might have come ""a little late"".
""There has to be a stand, not just from us in this country but internationally, against what is going on in Gaza,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One, describing himself as ""a very proud Jewâ¦who passionately cares for Israel"".
But silent, throughout all this, is the one man who could, if he wanted, stop the war.
At the end of his recent tour of the Gulf, Donald Trump said ""a lot of people are starving"".
White House officials indicated the US president was frustrated with the war and wanted the Israeli government to ""wrap it up"".
But while other western leaders release expressions of outrage, Trump is saying almost nothing."

But the US president's threat of a 50% tariff on all goods from the European Union in a week's time suggests the trade war tensions were merely on hold.
They have now resumed in earnest, alongside market uncertainty, and social media diplomacy.
It indicates significant volatility in the coming weeks, ahead of a crucial G7 summit in Canada next month. 
The crux of what is happening right now is that after the US opted to row back on its trade-stopping tariff conflict with China, most of the rest of the world, especially key US allies, slowed up on their own negotiations with the US. Allies would not expect to be treated worse by the US than China.
Friday's intervention by President Trump is much worse that what was considered the worst-case scenario - a 20% tariff rate on the EU in early July at the end of the 90-day pause. 
As his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent openly admitted, these threats are designed to ""light a fire"" under such stalled talks.
Many in the EU, and other countries such as Japan, believe the US administration is bluffing, and that it backed down against China in the face of rising inflation and market volatility, and will inevitably do so again.
So the scene is now set for an impasse or perhaps the EU to reinstate its own paused retaliation, while the rest of the world, apart from China and the UK, watches on.
The UK's trade deals with both sides insulate the British economy to some extent, but full resumption of a transatlantic tariff war would cause a trade shock that would be difficult to escape."

The watch officer of a large container ship that ran aground and crashed into a garden in Norway has told police he was asleep at the time of the incident.
Investigators said the man, a Ukrainian national in his thirties, admitted to falling asleep while on duty on his own.
He has been charged with negligent navigation and police are also investigating whether rules regarding working and rest hours were adhered to on board the vessel.
The 135m-ship (443ft) missed a house by metres when it ran aground on Thursday morning in Byneset, near Trondheim, central Norway. Efforts to refloat it have been unsuccessful so far.
""The individual charged was the officer on watch at the time of the incident,"" the prosecutor in TrÃ¸ndelag Police District said in a press statement.
""During questioning, he stated that he fell asleep while on duty alone, which led to the vessel running aground,"" Kjetil Bruland SÃ¸rensen added.
Local media reported that the man was in charge of steering the ship but failed to change course when entering the Trondheim Fjord.
No one was injured in the incident.
The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, the NCL Salten, had 16 people on board and was travelling south-west through the Trondheim Fjord to Orkanger when it veered off course.
Logistics company NCL, which chartered the ship, said this was a ""serious incident"" and it was grateful no one was harmed.
""This remains an ongoing rescue operation and our highest priority is to ensure a safe and secure salvage operation,"" the company's statement said, adding that it was assisting police with their investigation.
Johan Helberg, who owns the property the ship nearly crashed into, described the moment he looked out of his window and saw it in his front garden. 
""I had to bend my neck to see the top of it. It was so unreal,"" he said in an interview with the Guardian.
Mr Helberg said he was ""astonished"" to see the ship in front of his house and that it was ""five metres"" away from entering his bedroom.
""It's a very bulky new neighbour but it will soon go away,"" he told Norwegian television channel TV2.
He was alerted to the commotion by a panicked neighbour who heard the sound of the ship and watched as it headed straight for shore.
The neighbour's son said the experience was ""terrifying"" and his father screamed when he saw the ship. 
""I didn't know if I was dreaming because it was five in the morning and it was so surreal,"" Bard Jorgensen told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme.
It seemed like the vessel was going to ""directly"" hit the house, Mr Jorgensen said, adding that he was relieved to know his neighbour was unharmed.
According to reports, the ship had previously run aground in 2023 but crew managed to free it using its own power."

Russia and Ukraine have each handed over 390 soldiers and civilians in the biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022.
They both returned 270 servicemen and 120 civilians on the Ukrainian border with Belarus, as part of the only deal agreed in direct talks in Istanbul a week ago.
Both sides had agreed to an exchange of 1,000 prisoners and confirmed there would be further swaps in the coming days.
Although there have been dozens of smaller-scale exchanges, no other handover has involved as many civilians.
The Russian defence ministry said servicemen and civilians, including those captured by Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk border region during Kyiv's offensive in recent months, were among those handed over. 
They were currently on Belarusian territory and were to be taken to Russia for medical checks and treatment, the ministry said.
Russia's defence ministry shared images of the Russian servicemen released by Ukraine
""We are bringing our people home,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on social media. 
""We are verifying every surname, every detail about each person.""
Ukraine's co-ordination headquarters for prisoners of war said the 270 Ukrainian servicemen had fought in regions across the east and north, from Kyiv,  Chernihiv and Sumy to Donetsk, Kharkiv and Kherson. 
Three of the 390 released on Friday were women, officials said, and some of the soldiers had been held since 2022.
Relatives waited in northern Ukraine in the hope their fathers and husbands would soon come home
US President Donald Trump earlier posted his congratulations on his Truth Social platform, claiming that the swap was complete and that ""this could lead to something big???"".
Families of Ukrainian soldiers held by Russia gathered in northern Ukraine on Friday in the hope that their sons and husbands would be among those released.
Natalia, whose son Yelizar was captured during the battle for the city of Severodonetsk three years ago, told the BBC she believed he would return, but did not know when.
Olha held a photo of her son Valerii, who she said was captured two months ago
Olha said that since her son Valerii had been captured with five other soldiers in the east, her life had stopped, as she did not know if they were still alive.
""They were captured two months ago in Luhansk. They went missing in a village.""
The prisoner swap was agreed in Turkey a week ago, when low-level delegations from Ukraine and Russia came face to face for the first time since March 2022, even though the meeting lasted only two hours and failed to make any progress towards a ceasefire.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that there would be a second round of talks, when Moscow would hand a ""memorandum"" to the Ukrainian side.
Trump said earlier this week that Russia and Ukraine would ""immediately"" start negotiating towards a ceasefire and an end to the war, after a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Since then, Zelensky has accused Putin of ""trying to buy time"" to continue the war.
Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has backed a suggestion from Trump that the Vatican might mediate talks on negotiating a ceasefire, but Lavrov said that was ""not a very realistic option"".
The Russian foreign minister repeated an unfounded claim that Zelensky was not a legitimate leader and suggested new elections should be held before a potential future peace agreement is signed.
Asked if Russia was ready to sign a deal, Lavrov said: ""First we need to have a deal. And when it's agreed, then we will decide. But, as President Putin has said many times, President Zelensky does not have legitimacy.""
He said after an agreement was ready, Russia would ""see who out of those in power in Ukraine has legitimacy"".
""The key task now is to prepare a peace agreement which will be reliable and provide a long-term, stable and fair peace without creating security threats for anyone. In our case, we're concerned with Russia."""

A British woman has been arrested in Sri Lanka after police allegedly found 101lbs (46kg) of the synthetic drug kush in her suitcases. 
Custom officers posed for pictures with bags of drugs they accuse Charlotte May Lee, 21, from south London, of attempting to smuggle into the country earlier this month. 
The former flight attendant denies knowing there were drugs in her luggage and says she believes they were planted there. 
Ms Lee is being held in a prison north of the south Asian country's capital, Colombo, and is contact with her family, her lawyer told the BBC. She could face up to 25 years in prison if found guilty. 
A senior officer in the Sri Lanka Customs Narcotics Control Unit said the discovery, at Colombo's Bandaranaike Airport, was the largest kush seizure in the airport's history.
Her legal representative, Sampath Perera, told the BBC his team was visiting her daily in prison in the city of Negombo, to provide support and monitor her wellbeing. 
Ms Lee told Mail Online on Wednesday, external: ""I had never seen them [the drugs] before. I didn't expect it all when they pulled me over at the airport. 
Bags stuffed full of drugs were found in two large suitcases, authorities say
""I thought it was going to be filled with all my stuff.""
She told the paper she had been in Thailand's capital, Bangkok, prior to the flight, and had packed in her hotel room before heading out for the night. 
""They must have planted it then,"" she said. ""I know who did it.""
She did not check her luggage again before heading to Colombo, where she was arrested on 12 May, said Ms Lee. 
Ms Lee went to Sri Lanka as her visa was about to expire and she wanted a trip somewhere nearby before heading back to Thailand, she told the newspaper. 
She added that she faces harsh conditions in the prison, including sleeping on a concrete floor.
Ms Lee was said to have flown from Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport around the same time as another British woman, Bella Culley, 18, from Billingham, County Durham, who is being held in Georgia on suspicion of drug offences.
The BBC understands Ms Culley arrived in Tbilisi on a flight from the United Arab Emirates on 10 May. 
Three days later, Georgia's Ministry of Internal Affairs said Ms Culley was accused of ""illegally purchasing and storing a particularly large amount of narcotics, illegally purchasing and storing the narcotic drug marijuana, and illegally importing it into Georgia"".
A senior customs officer in Sri Lanka told the BBC: ""Another passenger who had left Bangkok airport, almost at the same time, was arrested in another country. We arrested this lady [Ms Lee] based on profiling.""
He said there had been a massive increase in drugs coming via Bangkok into Sri Lanka. 
""This has been a real nuisance.""
Ms Culley could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment if found guilty. 
She is being detained before trial while Georgian authorities investigate where 26lbs (12kg) of marijuana and 4.4lbs (2kg) of hashish found in a travel bag came from, and whether she was planning on handing it over to someone else."

When Shreya Mishra Reddy was admitted to Harvard University in 2023, her parents were ""ecstatic"". 
It is ""the ultimate school that anybody in India wants to get into,"" she tells the BBC. 
Now, with graduation around the corner, she has had to break the bad news to her family: she may not graduate in July from the executive leadership programme after the Trump administration moved to stop Harvard from enrolling international students ""as a result of their failure to adhere to the law"".
""It has been very difficult for my family to hear. They're still trying to process it,"" she said.
Ms Reddy is one of around 6,800 international students at Harvard, who make up more than 27% of its enrolments this year. They are a crucial source of revenue for the Ivy League school. About a third of its foreign students are from China, and more than 700 are Indian, such as Ms Reddy. 
All of them are now unsure of what to expect next. Harvard has called the move ""unlawful"", which could lead to a legal challenge.  
But that leaves the students' futures in limbo, be it those who are waiting to enrol this summer, or are halfway through college, or even those awaiting graduation whose work opportunities are tied to their student visas.   
Those who are already at Harvard would have to transfer to other American universities to remain in the US and retain their visas. 
""I hope Harvard will stand for us and some solution can be worked out,"" Ms Reddy says. 
The university has said it is ""fully committed to maintaining [its] ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University â and this nation â immeasurably"". 
Harvard University, America's oldest college, accepts thousands of international students every year
The move against Harvard has huge implications for the million or so international students in the US. And it follows a growing crackdown by the Trump administration on institutes of higher learning, especially those that witnessed major pro-Palestinian protests on campus. 
Dozens of them are facing investigations, as the government attempts to overhaul their accreditation process and reshape the way they are run. 
The White House first threatened to bar foreign students from Harvard in April, after the university refused to make changes to its hiring, admissions and teaching practices. And it also froze nearly $3bn in federal grants, which Harvard is challenging in court. 
Still, Thursday's announcement - which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said came because they were allegedly ""fostering violence"" and ""antisemitism"" - left students reeling. 
Chinese student Kat Xie, who is in her second year in a STEM programme, says she is ""in shock"".
""I had almost forgotten about [the earlier threat of a ban] and then Thursday's announcement suddenly came.""
But she adds a part of her had expected ""the worst"", so she had spent the last few weeks seeking professional advice on how to continue staying in the US. 
But the options are ""all very troublesome and expensive"", she says.
The Trump administration has been cracking down on pro-Palestinian campus protests 
Harvard has been given 72 hours to comply with a list of demands to have an ""opportunity"" to regain its ability to enrol these students, including providing the government with all disciplinary records for non-immigrant students enrolled at Harvard over the past five years. 
Noem also demanded Harvard turn over electronic records, videos, or audio of ""illegal"" and ""dangerous or violent"" activity by non-immigrant students on campus.
But the Trump administration also appeared to single China out when Noem also accused Harvard of ""coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party"" in her statement. 
Beijing responded on Friday by criticising the ""politicisation"" of education.
It said the move would ""only harm the image and international standing of the United States"", urging for the ban to be withdrawn ""as soon as possible"".
""None of this is what we've signed up for,"" says 20-year-old Abdullah Shahid Sial from Pakistan, a very vocal student activist.
A junior majoring in applied mathematics and economics, he was one of only two Pakistani undergraduate students admitted to Harvard in 2023. 
He was also the first person in his family to study abroad. It was a ""massive"" moment for them, he says. 
The situation he now finds himself in, he adds, is ""ridiculous and dehumanising"".
Abdullah Shahid Sial from Pakistan says getting into Harvard was a huge achievement for him
Both Ms Reddy and Mr Sial said foreign students apply to go to college in the US because they see it as a welcoming place where opportunities abound. 
""You have so much to learn from different cultures, from people of different backgrounds. And everybody really valued that,"" Ms Reddy says, adding that this had been her experience at Harvard so far.
But Mr Sial says that has changed more recently and foreign students no longer feel welcome - the Trump administration has revoked hundreds of student visas and even detained students on campuses across the country. Many of them were linked to pro-Palestinian protests.  
Now, Mr Sial adds, there is a lot of fear and uncertainty in the international student community. 
That has only been exacerbated by the latest development. A postgraduate student from South Korea says she is having second thoughts about going home for the summer because she fears she won't be able to re-enter the US.
She did not want to reveal her name because she is worried that might affect her chances of staying in the US. She is one year away from graduating.  
She said she had a gruelling semester and had been looking forward to ""reuniting with friends and family"" - until now. 
Jiang Fangzhou is enrolled at the Harvard Kennedy School 
The anxiety among foreign students is palpable, says Jiang Fangzhou, who is reading public administration in Harvard Kennedy School.
""We might have to leave immediately but people have their lives here - apartments, leases, classes and community. These are not things you can walk away from overnight.""
And the ban doesn't just affect current students, the 30-year-old New Zealander says.
""Think about the incoming ones, people who already turned down offers from other schools and planned their lives around Harvard. They're totally stuck now.""

A ""really muscly"" kangaroo ""tried to drown"" a man in Australia, after the two got into a punch-up.
Don James is said to have found himself fighting for his life as the marsupial held him down in floodwaters which had pooled on the side of the road near Port Macquarie - only escaping after the animal appeared to become spooked.
Kristy Lees, who watched the battle unfold in her rear-view mirror, told the BBC: ""It's not every day a big, male kangaroo decides to take you on... Even in Australia, you do not expect to see it.""
She suspects the ""very distressed"" kangaroo had become trapped in the area following the record flooding that hit New South Wales this week, leaving five people dead.
Ms Lees was first alerted to the kangaroo's presence as she drove down to check the water levels in Port Macquarie's North Shore with her husband, at about 09:00 local time on Friday (23:00 GMT on Thursday).
Two men - one of whom was later identified as Don James by Australian news network ABC, external - warned them that there was a ""really big"" kangaroo just around the next parked car.
And sure enough, there was the kangaroo - ""as big as the car"" it was standing next to.
The next thing Ms Lees knew, the kangaroo had launched towards her car, which she had slowed to a crawl so as not to startle the animal, and started to attack it.
But as he moved round to her side of the car, the kangaroo appeared to spot another target: Mr James, who was still walking away up the road.
The kangaroo gave chase.
""They literally got into a boxing match,"" Kristy said. ""I'm looking in the rear-view mirror and they are throwing punches.""
Mr James then ran backwards before tripping and falling into a patch of floodwater by the side of the road.
The next thing Kristy knew, the ""kangaroo was holding him down"".
""The kangaroo tried to drown the man,"" she said. ""I realised what was happening and told my husband [who couldn't see the fight from his seat] to get out the car and help.""
But then the kangaroo appears to have been spooked - perhaps by the approaching car driven by Mr James's friend - allowing him to escape down towards Ms Lees, who has since tried to warn as many neighbours as possible.
""The kangaroo was trying to drown me,"" he told Ms Lees, who was able to say she had seen it all.
""I just remember being under water and kicking and screaming and carrying on,"" Mr James later told ABC.
It was, he said, ""pretty traumatic for a while there"".
Kangaroos have been known to appear to attempt to drown their foes - although these are usually animals the size of dogs.
Kangaroo ecologist Graeme Coulson, from the University of Melbourne, revealed to ABC that his neighbour had lost two dogs that way., external
""There's a very strong instinct - kangaroos will go to water if they're threatened by a predator,"" he told the news network.
However, he said, the behaviour is likely more about protecting themselves than drowning their foe. 
That is unlikely to make Mr James feel any better about Friday morning's altercation - especially as he told Ms Lees that just 12 months ago he had fended off another attack, that time by a great white shark.
""I feel like they're trying to kill me, all these animals,"" he reportedly said.
The BBC has attempted to contact Mr James for comment."

Satellite images have for the first time shown the extent of a shipyard accident in North Korea that damaged a new warship in the presence of the secretive state's leader, Kim Jong Un.
The image shows the warship lying on its side, covered by large blue tarpaulins. A portion of the vessel appears to be on land.
An official investigation into the accident - which Kim described as a ""criminal act"" - has begun, state media reported on Friday.
None of the reports mentioned any casualties or injuries as a result of Thursday's incident in the eastern port city of Chongjin.
KCNA, North Korea's official news agency, downplayed the damage in a report on Friday, saying it was ""not serious"" and that, contrary to initial reports, there were no holes on the ship's bottom.
""The hull starboard was scratched and a certain amount of seawater flowed into the stern section through the rescue channel,"" KCNA reported.
The manager of the shipyard, Hong Kil Ho, has been summoned by law enforcers, it said.
It would take around 10 days to restore the destroyer's side, according to KCNA.
Kim said on Thursday that the accident was caused by ""absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism"".
He added that those who made ""irresponsible errors"" will be dealt with at a plenary meeting next month.
It's not clear what punishment they might face, but the authoritarian state has a woeful human rights record.
It is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents - though it has done this a handful of times in the past.
This particular accident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a similar 5,000-ton destroyer, the Choe Hyon.
Kim had called that warship a ""breakthrough"" in modernising North Korea's navy and said it would be deployed early next year."

South Africa's latest crime statistics debunk claims that a genocide is being committed against white people, the country's police minister has said.
The widely discredited allegation was amplified by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday, in an extraordinary meeting with his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.
Trump told Ramaphosa that white farmers in South Africa were being killed and ""persecuted"".
On Friday, South African Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said that between January and March, five out of the six people killed on farms were black and one was white.
The white victim lived on a farm, while the black people who were killed comprised two farm owners, two employees and one manager.

How Trump-Ramaphosa confrontation went down in South Africa
Mchunu said that in the previous quarter, from October to December 2024, 12 murders on farms were recorded. One of the 12 - a farm owner - was white.
It is the first time that South Africa's crime statistics have been broken down by race, but Mchunu said he had done so as a result of the recent genocide claims.
""The history of farm murders in the country has always been distorted and reported in an unbalanced way,"" he said. 
In February, a South African judge dismissed the idea of a genocide as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to a white supremacist group.
Claims of genocide in South Africa have been circulating for years, catching the attention of right-wing groups in the US.
Ramaphosa visited the White House on Wednesday in an attempt to reset the countries' relations after Trump granted asylum to nearly 60 Afrikaners - descendants of mainly Dutch settlers who arrived in the 17th Century - saying they were ""victims of unjust racial discrimination"".
During the meeting, which was broadcast live, Trump ambushed Ramaphosa with videos and images intended to support his claim of a white genocide.
The BBC found that this ""evidence"" contained numerous falsehoods. 
""We have respect for the US as a country, we have respect for the people in that country and for President Trump, but we have no respect for the genocide story. It is totally unfounded and unsubstantiated,"" Mchunu said on Friday.
A spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office also condemned Trump's comments.
""These are very serious issues. One should not use this word [genocide] casually without deep knowledge of what this means. Looking at the history of South Africa, it is wholly inappropriate,"" Ravina Shamdasani is quoted by the AFP news agency as saying.
South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world and Mchunu acknowledged that crime was a huge problem.
However, he added that all sections of society were affected.
The minister also rejected allegations, repeated by Trump, that government was expropriating land held by white farmers.
Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law which allowed the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in some circumstances. The South African government says no land has been seized yet under the act.
The law follows years of calls for land reform in South Africa, where the white minority possess the vast majority of privately held land and wealth in the country, more than 30 years since the racist system of apartheid ended.
Relations between South Africa and the US have slumped since Trump took office in January. As well as offering asylum to Afrikaners, the US leader has cut aid to South Africa and expelled its ambassador.

Russian activist Lyudmila Vasilyeva, an 84-year-old survivor of the siege of Leningrad in World War Two, has been fined by a court after protesting Russia's war in Ukraine.
During her sentencing hearing in St Petersburg on Friday, Ms Vasilyeva was ordered to pay 10,000 rubles ($126; Â£93) for ""discrediting"" the Russian army. 
The charges related to a handwritten poster she held up earlier this year which read: ""People, let's stop the war. We are responsible for peace on the planet Earth. With love, Lyudmila Vasilyeva, child of the Leningrad blockade.""
Russia has cracked down on criticism of its military action in Ukraine since launching its full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022.
In an interview with AFP ahead of her hearing at Kuibyshevsky District Court on Friday, she said she felt ""bitterness"" and ""hurt"" over the fate of her country.
""I have always been someone who is not indifferent, from childhood. I have always been on the side of the weak,"" she said.
She was greeted by dozens of supporters outside the courtroom. Footage showed her holding flowers and receiving applause.
Fined for yellow and blue shoes: How Russian laws smother dissent
The 84-year-old survived the Siege of Leningrad as a very young child with her four siblings and mother. 
The military blockade of Leningrad by Nazi Germany lasted 872 days, from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944. About 800,000 people died from hunger, cold and shelling by Nazi troops.
Speaking to AFP, Ms Vasilyeva recalled that her mother used to tell her: ""'We will get through everything, as long as there is no war'"".
The name of the city of Leningrad was restored to its pre-Soviet era name, St Petersburg, in 1991.
Ms Vasilyeva has long been a critic of Russia's war with Ukraine having been detained several times in 2022. 
Last year, she ran for governor of St Petersburg but failed to collect the required number of signatures for a nomination, as reported by BBC Russian.
The Russian law that penalises ""discrediting"" the army has been applied to a broad variety of actions, which the Kremlin interprets as either support for Ukraine or criticism of the war.
They include displaying anti-war posters, with messages ranging from ""No War"" to eight asterisks - the number of Russian letters that spell ""No War"".
The war in Ukraine has been raging for more than three years and military experts estimate between 165,000 and 235,000 Russian service personnel have been killed since the full-scale invasion.
Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian military deaths. Western analysts believe this figure is an under-estimate."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has launched a blistering attack on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the leaders of France and Canada - saying that they had ""effectively said they want Hamas to remain in power"". 
He also accused Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney of siding with ""mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers"".
Netanyahu was speaking after Thursday's deadly attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington. Days earlier, the UK, France and Canada had condemned Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza as ""disproportionate"" and described the humanitarian situation as ""intolerable"".
Downing Street has pointed to Sir Keir's condemnation of the Washington attack.
In that post, external, Sir Keir called antisemitism an ""evil we must stamp out"".
All three countries denounced the Washington killings, which saw embassy workers Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, shot dead at an event hosted by the Capital Jewish Museum. 
The suspect, Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, repeatedly shouted ""free Palestine"" as he was arrested, police said.
Social media accounts linked to the suspect indicate that he was involved in pro-Palestinian protest movements. Investigators say they are working to verify online writings purportedly by him that accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza and criticise US policy. 
According to details in an affidavit, the suspect landed in Washington the night prior to the event and bought a ticket a few hours before it started. 
He also referenced a 2024 incident in which a man set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington. According to the affidavit, he expressed admiration for the act, calling the man a ""martyr"" for his protest over the conflict.
In addition to condemning Wednesday's shooting, the UK, France and Canada - close allies of Israel - have come out in strong support of Israel following the deadly Hamas-led attacks 19 months ago. 
Their statement demanding Israel halt its latest offensive was widely viewed as the strongest criticism of Israel's military action since the war in Gaza began. It threatened concrete actions if Israel did not change course. 
On Wednesday Sir Keir added that Israel's decision to allow only a small amount of aid into Gaza was ""utterly inadequate"" and the UK suspended talks over a possible trade deal.
In his video, Netanyahu said Hamas wanted to destroy Israel and annihilate the Jewish people. He said the Palestinian armed group had welcomed the joint UK, French and Canadian criticism of Israel's war conduct.
Some of Israel's closest allies wanted Israel to ""stand down and accept that Hamas's army of mass murderers will survive"", he said.
""I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer, when mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice,"" he added.
""You're on the wrong side of humanity, and you're on the wrong side of history.""
Netanyahu went on to blame a recent claim by UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher that thousands of babies would imminently die in Gaza if Israel did not immediately let in aid for the attack in Washington.
""A few days ago, a top UN official said that 14,000 Palestinian babies would die in 48 hours. You see many international institutions are complicit in spreading this lie,"" he said.
""The press repeats it. The mob believed it. And a young couple is then brutally gunned down in Washington.""
When asked at the time for clarification on Fletcher's statement, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) spokesman Jens Laerke said ""there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements... and if they do not get those, they will be in mortal danger"".
Also on Thursday, an Israeli minister, Amichai Chikli, accused Sir Keir and other leaders of ""emboldening the forces of terror"". 
On Friday, UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard condemned the killings in Washington but rejected Netanyahu's strong criticism of the British prime minister.  
He said: ""We stand in support of Israel's right to self-defence as long as they conduct that within international humanitarian law - a position we've had since those appalling attacks on 7 October. 
""We are also very clear we need to see aid get to the people who are genuinely suffering in Gaza.""
French foreign ministry spokesman Christophe Lemoine also reiterated his criticism of Israel's ""escalation"" in Gaza following Netanyahu's statement.
He told FranceInfo radio: ""Israel has to let the aid in. Access has to be massive and free.""
On Thursday, more than 90 lorries carrying aid supplies were allowed to cross into Gaza but the UN said that level was ""nowhere near enough"" to meet the needs of Palestinians living there.
The trickle of aid follows an 11-week total blockade, which humanitarian groups said risked widespread famine. Israel resumed air strikes in March which have since killed 3,613 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
In an interview for BBC World Service's Newshour programme, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert described the current Israeli administration as a ""gang of thugs"".
He was asked about remarks by the Israeli education minister, who had said Olmert should be ashamed of a previous interview with the BBC, where he argued that what Israel was doing in Gaza was ""close to a war crime"".
""This is nonsense, they are a group of thugs that are running the state of Israel these days and the head of the gang is Netanyahu - this is a gang of thugs,"" Olmert said.
""Of course they are criticising me, they are defaming me, I accept it, and it will not stop me from criticising and opposing these atrocious policies.""
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,762 people, including 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

A verdict is due in the trial of 10 people accused of robbing US celebrity Kim Kardashian of millions of dollars' worth of jewellery in Paris nearly a decade ago.
Nine men and one woman are accused of carrying out or aiding the armed burglary of Â£10m (Â£7.55m) worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring, during Paris Fashion Week in 2016. 
Prosecutors are seeking a 10-year sentence for four of the men accused of carrying out the robbery, and between eight and six years for the five other men and woman accused of being accessories to the crime. 
The defendants delivered their final statements in court and were dismissed on Friday morning, with a verdict expected later in the day.
Many of the defendants are now elderly and unwell, leading French media to dub them the ""grandpa robbers"".
But since the trial started on 28 April, both prosecutors and civil parties have vigorously pushed back against the notion that the alleged robbers were harmless, with Kardashian stating the heist â during which she was tied up and held at gunpoint â had left her traumatised.
Prosecutor general Anne-Dominique Merville said the sentences should reflect the ""seriousness"" and the ""violence"" of the robbery.
She urged the jury not to be swayed by the age and the health conditions of the defendants who â at the time of the heist â were ""seasoned robbers"".
On the night between 3 and 4 October 2016, as Kardashian was in her room at the Hotel de Pourtales in central Paris, a gang of five men made their way into the building.
As three kept guard downstairs, two forced receptionist Abderrahmane Ouatiki â now also a plaintiff in the case â to take them to Kardashian's room and act as translator as they demanded she hand over her jewellery, including an engagement ring worth $4m. Then, they fled.
The defendants were arrested by police in January 2017, but the jewellery was never found.
DNA evidence for Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, and Yunice Abbas, 71, placed them at the scene of the crime, and the two have admitted their involvement.
Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, has admitted his involvement in the heist
However, Khedache â who is now disabled, deaf and mute â has denied he was the ringleader. Although he admitted he was one of the two who went into Kardashian's room, pointed a gun at her and tied her up, he said he was never violent, ""least of all with a woman"".
His lawyers urged the jury to bear in mind his health condition and said that there was no risk of him reoffending. ""At his age, prison time means a life sentence,"" lawyer Frank Berton said.
Abbas, who has Parkinson's disease and recently underwent heart surgery, told the jury on Friday morning that regretted his actions. ""I'm sorry for what I was capable of doing,"" he said.
Among the other defendants was a man who worked as a driver for the Kardashian family. He denies providing information on their movements to the robbers and another man who prosecutors say was the getaway driver.
Last week, during an emotional five-hour testimony delivered through an interpreter, Kim Kardashian shared her traumatic memories of that night.
She was composed but at times struggled to fight back tears as she recalled the moment she feared the robbers would sexually assault her.
""I don't wish that kind of terror on anyone - to think you could be killed or raped... I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy,"" the 44-year-old said, standing metres away from the defendants and dabbing her eyes with a tissue.
Kardashian also said among the jewellery taken from her was a watch that her late father had gifted her. ""I can't get that back, it wasn't just jewellery... someone took away my memories,"" she stated.
When the court president, David De Pas, read out a letter written of apology written by Khedache, Kardashian said that she forgave him. However, she said it could not erase the trauma she had experienced.
Night receptionist Abderrahmane Ouatiki, the other plaintiff in the case, was present in court throughout the trial. Since the heist, the Algerian former PhD student has experienced PTSD, quit his studies and left France. 
In his closing arguments, his lawyer said that while it was ""harder to be a victim when one is anonymous and poor"" and that ""not everyone can afford to be surrounded by bodyguards to sleep better"", he believed justice could finally ""restore the balance""."

""You aren't ready for the party Naples will have tonight"".
SSC Napoli fans Francesco Giordano and Vincenzo Liberti have been up since before 07:00 this morning.
They're nervous and excited ahead of one of their team's biggest matches.
In this one club city, everyone is praying for the party that can only begin with one more victory. The victory that would see Napoli claim just their fourth Scudetto ever.
With one round of fixtures remaining, Antonio Conte's side sit just a single point above serial winners Inter and so a nail-biting finale it is. Napoli host Cagliari and Inter travel to in-form Como.
SSC Napoli fans Vincenzo and Francesco cannot wait for the big match on Friday
Francesco tells BBC Scotland news: ""We are buzzing. We just can't wait. We are just so passionate about it and can't wait to experience this wonderful end of the season.
""If it happens, everybody is going to go bananas and it will be something you've never experienced.""
Vincenzo agrees and says a win will set of fireworks, adding: ""You are not ready for what will happen tonight. It's a party of the city not just the team.""
Down the narrow streets of the Spanish quarter, flags fly from balconies next to freshly washed laundry.
Blue and white ribbons and streamers have been stretched high across the streets of the shopping district and, in the old port, bunting flutters from the boats bobbing in the Mediterranean.
The Neapolitans are superstitious. Few here will give predictions for the match but what locals are happy to talk about is how two Scots have played an integral part in taking their side to the brink of glory - Scott McTominay and Billy Gilmour.
McTominay and Gilmour have played an integral part in Napoli's success this season
Francesco said the pair made a big impression on the fans.
""They conquered our hearts,"" he said. ""Billy came in during difficult moments and played a crucial role throughout the whole season.
""Scott McTominay, we are lost for words for him. He is an unbelievable player and we just hope tonight he can conquer the final moment of the season and score for all of us.
""We are so passionate about it and the players absolutely felt that and once they settled and found their way they started to play well - they are wonderful.""
At the start of the season Scott McTominay signed from Manchester United for Â£25m. The club also secured the services of McTominay's international team mate, Billy Gilmour from Brighton. Price tag - Â£12m.
Few could have predicted the impact they would make and the hero status that would follow.
Napoli fans say Scottish courage will help them
Gilmour has played 25 games and is hailed in the city as the man who builds from the back and makes things happen.
McTominay has found the net 11 times in 33 appearances and is second only to Romalu Lukaku in terms of goals scored for Napoli this season.
He has also drawn level with Denis Law in the top ranked Scots in Serie A.
Law spent a season with Torino in 1963 and notched up 11 goals of his own before heading back to the UK.
""McTominay really is the story of Serie A this season,"" said local football journalist Vincenzo Credendino. 
""The people here can see how hard he works for the team and in this city that is so important.""
McTominay  and Gilmour have hero status at Napoli 
McTominay's nickname in Naples is McFratm
The love for McTimonay is such that his image adorns the walls of Naples next to the murals of the city's favourite son, Diego Maradona. 
The Scot even has a special shrine in Vico San Nicola al Nilo, and a nickname - ""McFratm"".
Fratm is a colloquial term in this part of Italy that essentially translates to ""bro"".
Nobody is quite sure who it was that added the Scottish ""Mc"" but when you mention the word McTominay in this city, people instantly smile and say ""McFratm."" It seems it's a nickname that's set to stick.
The love for both players has come, not just from their abilities on the pitch and the part played in getting the club so close to Italian football's promised land, but from their desire to be part of Neapolitan life.
In this fiercely proud part of Italy, Gilmour's ability and desire to pick up the language and his fellow countryman's much publicised love of the local tomatoes, means a lot here.
Blue and white ribbons and streamers have been stretched high across the streets of the shopping district and in the old port
At Napoli, it's about more than just kissing the badge.
""The Neapolitans and the Scots are similar, I think,"" Vincenzo Credendino said. ""Maybe it's about both places having a history of resisting.
""But I think the people here can see that the players love Naples. 
""They take many pictures around the city and talk openly about how much they love the food - that is very important here.""
Now, what both parties in this football love-in would like is for this story to end with the biggest celebration of all.
At one of football's biggest clubs, two Scots are to be found at its beating heart. 
If they deliver just once more this season and get Napoli over the line, both will be immortalised in a city where footballers are worshipped like gods."

The lawsuit also named TMZ and Yahoo as defendants, and said their news stories ""mocked their youth"" and ""misrepresented their traditions"". 
The NYT said its report did not say any of the tribe's members were addicted to porn. TMZ and Yahoo have been contacted for comment.
The Marubo, an Indigenous community of about 2,000 people, is seeking at least $180m (Â£133m) in damages.
The NYT's story, written nine months after the Marubo gained access to Starlink, a satellite-internet service from Elon Musk's SpaceX, said the tribe was ""already grappling with the same challenges that have racked American households for years"".
This included ""teenagers glued to phones"", ""violent video games"" and ""minors watching pornography"", the report said.
It stated that a community leader and vocal critic of the internet was ""most unsettled by the pornography"", and had been told of ""more aggressive sexual behaviour"" from young men.
The report also noted the perceived benefits of the internet among the tribe, including the ability to alert authorities to health issues and environmental destruction and stay in touch with faraway family. 
The lawsuit claims other news outlets sensationalised the NYT's report, including a headline from TMZ referencing porn addiction. 
The response led the NYT to run a follow-up report, external around a week after its original story, with the headline: ""No, A Remote Amazon Tribe Did Not Get Addicted to Porn"".
The report said ""more than 100 websites around the world"" had ""published headlines that falsely claim the Marubo have become addicted to porn"".
But the lawsuit claimed the NYT's original story had ""portrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography"".
The named plaintiffs, community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazillian activist Flora Dutra, who helped to distribute the 20 $15,000 Starlink antennas to the tribe, said the NYT story helped fuel ""a global media storm"", according to the Courthouse News Service.
This, they said, subjected them to ""humiliation, harassment and irreparable harm to their reputations and safety"". 
The TMZ story included video footage of Marubo and Dutra distributing the antennas, which they said ""created the unmistakable impression [they] had introduced harmful, sexually explicit material into the community and facilitated the alleged moral and social decay"".
A spokesperson for the New York Times said: ""Any fair reading of this piece shows a sensitive and nuanced exploration of the benefits and complications of new technology in a remote Indigenous village with a proud history and preserved culture. 
""We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit."""

The Democratic Republic of Congo's senate has stripped former President Joseph Kabila of his immunity, paving the way for his prosecution over his alleged backing of rebels in the east.  
Authorities have accused him of treason and war crimes, saying there was a ""substantial body of documents, testimony and material facts"" linking Kabila to the M23 armed group, which has taken control of several towns in the mineral-rich east.
Kabila, 53, has not commented on the accusations but has in the past denied any connection with the insurgents. 
Nearly 90 senators on Thursday voted in favour of his treason prosecution, while  five opposed it.
""The senate authorises the prosecution and lifting of Joseph Kabila's immunity,"" declared senate Speaker Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde after Thursday's vote. 
The former president, who led the country between 2001 and 2019, did not appear before the senate to defend himself.
After stepping down, he was given the title of ""senator for life"", which gives him legal immunity.
PODCAST: Why are people talking about Kabila's return?
What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?
In order to pursue the charges against him, DR Congo's military prosecutor had asked the senate to lift this privilege. 
Kabila has been living outside the country, in South Africa, for the past two years. But at the beginning of last month he said he would be returning to help find a solution to the conflict in the east.
A few weeks later, there were reports that the former president had come back and was in Goma, one of the cities captured by the M23.
But these were denied by his political party, the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD).
Last month, the authorities banned the PPRD because of its ""ambiguous attitude"" to the occupation of Congolese territory by the M23.
Ordering the seizure of Kabila's assets, Justice Minister Mutamba said the former president should return to the country and ""face justice... and present his defence"".
Analysts say any trial of Kabila could further destabilise the country, which has been battling the M23 rebellion since 2012. 
Kabila's party termed his prosecution ""pure theatre"" aimed at distracting Congolese people from the main challenges facing the country, AFP news agency reported. 
Kabila, a former military officer, took over leadership of the country in 2001 at the age of just 29, after his father Laurent Kabila, was assassinated.
While Kabila supported Tshisekedi's rise to power, they later fell out and relations between their parties' coalition formally ended in December 2020.
Kabila has retained significant power through his political party and his influence within the ruling coalition, potentially undermining Tshisekedi's presidency.
Kabila left DR Congo in 2023, officially to study in South Africa.
Fighting between the M23 and the Congolese army and allied militia has continued in the east as the rebels attempt to expand their territory.
DR Congo and Rwanda, which denies accusations it backs the M23, may be edging towards a peace deal to end the fighting, which has seen hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes in recent months.
The two countries signed a preliminary agreement in Washington last month and said they had agreed on a pathway to peace. 
Last year, three M23 leaders were prosecuted in absentia by a military court and given death sentences for treason.
The government in March offered a reward of $5m (Â£4m) for help arresting the rebel leaders - Corneille Nangaa, Sultani Makenga and Bertrand Bisimwa.

A Royal Bengal tiger was killed and dismembered by a mob in India's north eastern state of Assam, a forest official has said.
Angry residents from a village in the Golaghat district reportedly took the step because the tiger had killed livestock in the area and posed a threat to their lives. 
The state's forest department has registered a case.
Instances of man-animal conflict are not new to Assam. This is the third tiger killing that has been reported this year.
Top forest official Gunadeep Das told Times of India newspaper that the tiger had died from sharp wounds and not gunshots.
The carcass was later recovered in the presence of a magistrate, reports say. 
Mr Das told a local newspaper, external that ""around a thousand people had gathered to kill the tiger"" and that some of them attacked the tiger with machetes. He added that the tiger's carcass had been sent for an autopsy.
Mrinal Saikia, a lawmaker from Assam state condemned the killing on X. He shared a video that showed the purported dead body of the tiger with parts of its skin, face and legs missing. 
The BBC has not independently verified the video. 
""This is a very painful act. The Earth is not only for humans, it is for animals as well,"" he said in the post, adding that strict action will be taken against those involved in the killing.
Another forest official, Sonali Ghosh told local media that the origins of the tiger were unclear. According to reports, the animal was killed about 20km (12 miles) away from the Kaziranga National Park.
Latest data, external by Assam's forest department shows the population of tigers in the state has steadily increased from just 70 in 2006 to 190 in 2019 due to various conservation efforts.
However, instances of tigers being killed due to conflict with villagers have been often reported, external in the media, which could be because of shrinking habitat and lack of protection of tiger corridors between different national parks in the state. 
Tigers are a protected species under India's Wildlife Protection Act (1972), which prohibits poaching, hunting and trade of tiger parts."

The 135m-ship (443ft) missed Johan Helberg's house by metres at about 05:00 local time (03:00 GMT) on Thursday.
Mr Helberg was only alerted to the commotion by his panicked neighbour who had watched the ship as it headed straight for shore, in Byneset, near Trondheim.
""The doorbell rang at a time of day when I don't like to open,"" Mr Helberg told television channel TV2.
""I went to the window and was quite astonished to see a big ship,"" he added, in an interview with the Guardian., external
""I had to bend my neck to see the top of it. It was so unreal."" 
""Five metres further south and it would have entered the bedroom,"" he added to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I didn't hear anything."" 
Neighbour Jostein Jorgensen said he was woken by the sound of the ship as it headed at full speed towards land, and ran to Mr Helberg's house.
""I was sure that he was already outside, but no, there was no sign of life. I rang the doorbell many times and nothing,"" said Mr Jorgensen.
""And it was only when I called him on the phone that I managed to contact him,"" he told TV2.
The Cypriot-flagged cargo ship, the NCL Salten, had 16 people on board and was travelling south-west through the Trondheim Fjord to Orkanger when it went off course. 
No-one was injured in the incident.
It is not known what caused the crash and Norwegian police are said to be investigating.
""It's a very bulky new neighbour but it will soon go away,"" Mr Helberg added.
The head of NCL, which chartered the ship, said it was a ""serious incident"" and ""we are grateful that nobody was injured"". 
""At present time, we do not know what caused the incident and are awaiting the conclusion of the ongoing investigation by the relevant authorities,"" said managing director Bente Hetland.
According to reports, the ship had previously run aground in 2023 but got free under its own power.

The UK has signed a Â£3.4bn ($4.6bn) deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of a UK-US military base on Diego Garcia - the largest of the islands.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says the 99-year agreement to lease back Diego Garcia will cost the UK Â£101m a year, and is necessary to protect the base from ""malign influence"". Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam said the agreement completed ""the total process of decolonisation"".
But UK opposition leaders - and some Chagossians now resident in the UK - have criticised the deal. 
The Chagos Islands - officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory - are located in the Indian Ocean about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK, and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius.
The islands, also known as the Chagos Archipelago - comprised of seven atolls with about 60 individual islands - were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony.
Britain purchased the islands for Â£3m but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence from Britain.
In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, the largest of the Chagos Islands, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.
Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.
The UK has handed sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius, but will lease use of Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years - at an average cost of Â£101m a year.
The UK will pay Â£165m in each of the first three years. From years four to 13, it will pay Â£120m a year. After that, payments will be indexed to inflation.
Sir Keir said continued use of Diego Garcia as a military base had been signed off by members of the five eyes alliance - the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US will pay for ""running costs"" of the base, he said.
The agreement also includes a Â£40m trust fund to support Chagossians. 
Under the deal, although Mauritius will control Diego Garcia, it will not be allowed to resettle the island.
Bernadette Dugasse is one of two Chagossian women, born on Diego Garcia, who brought a last-minute legal challenge over the deal to the UK's High Court. She told the BBC: ""I don't belong in the UK, I don't belong in Mauritius, I don't belong in the Seychelles. I belong in Diego Garcia.""
Their legal challenge had temporarily blocked the deal when a court injunction was granted, but the High Court went on to dismiss the challenge.
Bernadette Dugasse (right) and Bertice Pompe, born on Diego Garcia, brought a last-minute legal challenge to the High Court
Diego Garcia is the largest of the Chagos Islands.
Since the early 1970s, the UK and the US have jointly run a secretive military base there. The government says its facilities include an airfield and deep-water port, as well as advanced communications and surveillance capabilities.
There are no commercial flights to the island. Access is granted by the military facility or, previously, the British authority that ran the territory.
Diego Garcia is seen as having high strategic important because of its location in the heart of the Indian Ocean.
During the US ""war on terror"" after the 9/11 attacks, aircraft were sent directly from the island to carry out missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The Conservatives have criticised the deal. Party leader Kemi Badenoch called the deal an ""act of national self-harm"".
""It leaves us more exposed to China, and ignores the will of the Chagossian people. And we're paying billions to do so,"" she said.
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the deal was ""not necessary"" and played ""into China's hands"".
The government, however, said the continued use of the military base on Diego Garcia would have been untenable without signing the deal.
Defence Secretary John Healey said: ""Without this deal, within weeks, we could face losing legal rulings and within just a few years the base would become inoperable"".
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a post on X, said Washington ""welcomed"" the agreement which secured the ""long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-UK military facility at Diego Garcia, which is critical to regional and global security"".
Diego Garcia has been home to a joint UK-US military base since the 1970s
Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam said the deal was a ""great victory for the Mauritian nation"".
Mauritian Attorney General Gavin Glover told the BBC: ""Our country is elated that this 60-year struggle is finally over, especially for our brothers and sisters who were forced to leave their homes.""
Although Chagossians have differing views on the deal, one elderly woman at the headquarters of the Chagos Refugee Group headquarters in Mauritius, celebrated it. ""Now I can finally go thereâ¦ and die in peace,"" she said."

""Our thoughts are with communities that are cut off...we're here to basically say - very clearly and explicitly - you are not alone.""
Albanese thanked the emergency services for responding to hundreds of rescue calls, saying ""at the worse of times, we see the best of the Australian character"".
The NSW State Emergency Service (SES) said it had responded to more than 535 flood rescues in the 24 hours to 05:00 local time (19:00 GMT) - and more than  670 rescues since the flooding began. 
There are more than 150 flood warnings in place with 40 of those at emergency level and authorities have re-issued earlier advice for people not to drive or enter floodwaters.
More than 100 schools have been closed because of the floods, which have left thousands of homes and businesses without power. Evacuation centres have been opened for those fleeing the flooding.
Taree, a city on the Mid North Coast, has been among the worst affected. On Wednesday, flooding at a major river in the area surpassed 6.3m (20.6ft), beating an almost century old record for its highest level.

""It's very difficult to get supplies into some of these isolated communities,"" Minns said, adding that the prime minister has pledged his support for any help needed from the federal government.
Minns also urged those who are in ""prepare to evacuate"" areas to leave if they can, while acknowledging some won't be able to.
""They may be elderly, they might be infirm, they might have young children. But if we can get the majority of people out of harm's way, it makes everybody's job a lot easier.""
Jihad Dib, NSW Minister for Emergency Services, said that the state government continued to ""throw every single thing we've got"" toward rescue operations.

Mr Shapiro was the co-founder of Sound Talent Group, whose clients include rock bands like Sum 41, Story of the Year and Pierce the Veil.
Daniel Williams, former drummer for the band The Devil Wears Prada, is also feared to have been involved in the crash. Media reports indicate he posted on social media from the plane.
Federal officials say there were six people on board the plane and all are presumed dead. The crash destroyed one home and damaged 10 others in the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood, leaving charred cars and fiery debris.
""We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends,"" a spokesman for Sound Talent Group said in a statement to the BBC. 
""Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today's tragedy. Thank you so much for respecting their privacy at this time.""

Mr Simpson added that the NTSB was in the process of collecting evidence, and said they found some fragments of the aircraft under the power lines and a wing on a nearby street.

Police say the victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were killed by a man who shouted ""free, free Palestine"" while he was arrested. Elias Rodriguez has been charged with first-degree murder.
Here's what you need to know about the shooting. 
At 21:08 local time on Wednesday, police received calls about a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in downtown Washington DC. 
A man and a woman were found unconscious and not breathing at the scene, and later died. 
The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said the couple had been leaving an event at the museum which is in an area with tourist sites, museums and government buildings.
Police allege the shooting was committed by Elias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago, who had bought a ticket to the event about three hours before it began.
He had been seen pacing up and down outside the museum before using a handgun to open fire on a group of four people, the MPD said.
According to details in an affidavit, he initially opened fire on the victims, then reloaded and shot again ""several more times"" at closer range.
It said that as one victim tried to crawl away, he followed behind and fired again.
Investigators recovered 21 spent 9mm cartridges at the scene, and a handgun with its slide locked back, indicating it was empty, along with an empty magazine.
The suspect then went inside the museum, where he was detained. He repeatedly shouted ""free Palestine"" while being arrested, police said.
Some in the museum had initially thought he was a distressed bystander when he burst in.
One witness, Yoni Kalin, said people inside had been ""calming him down, giving him water, taking care of him"". 
""Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in cold blood,"" he said.
The MPD and the FBI are investigating the attack as an act of terrorism and a hate crime.  
Yaron Lischinsky had planned to propose to his girlfriend Sarah Lynn Milgrim
Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, had both worked at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC. 
Mr Lischinsky had planned to propose to Miss Milgrim in Jerusalem next week, Israel's ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, said on Thursday.
Yaron Lischinsky, a joint German-Israeli national, had worked as a research assistant at the embassy, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Born in Germany, he had moved to Israel as a teenager before relocating to Washington, his friend Ronen Shoval said.
He was a ""devout Christian"" with ""good character"", Mr Shoval told the BBC.
He had also previously served in the Israeli military, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Ron Prosor, said.
Sarah Lynn Milgrim, an American from Kansas, worked for the Israeli embassy's public diplomacy department, according to her LinkedIn page.
Her father, Robert, told the BBC's US partner CBS News that his daughter ""loved Israel"" and ""loved everybody that lived in the Middle East"".
""She had a lot of close Palestinian friends, as well as many Israeli friends,"" he said.
KU Hillel, a Jewish student organisation at the University of Kansas, said Miss Milgrim was a ""beloved alum"" with a ""bright spirit"". 
The Israeli embassy said its staff were ""heartbroken and devastated"" by the deaths.

Israeli museum victim 'was planning to propose'
Elias Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of first degree murder in relation to the shooting.
He has also been charged with murder of foreign officials, causing death with a firearm, and discharging a firearm in a crime of violence.
According to an affidavit, the suspect flew from Chicago on Tuesday and declared a gun legally bought in Illinois in his checked luggage.
In an interview with detectives, the affidavit said, he referenced a 2024 incident in which a man set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington DC, expressing admiration for the act and calling the man a ""martyr"" for his protest over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Authorities say the investigation is ongoing, and more charges could be brought against him as it develops. 
Interim DC attorney Jeanine Pirro said it was too early to say whether prosecutors will seek the death penalty, but that this was a ""death penalty eligible case"". 
The suspect is being held in detention and will appear in court for a preliminary hearing on 18 June, Pirro added.
He is believed to have acted alone, said US Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Earlier on Thursday, the FBI searched a Chicago property linked to the suspect. 
Outside the apartment, neighbour John Wayne Fry told reporters that he had lived in the same apartment building as the suspect for around a year.
He said that the suspect displayed a photo outside his flat of a Palestinian-American child who was stabbed to death outside Chicago in 2023.
The killing caused international headlines. The man who killed six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi was convicted of hate crime charges earlier this month. Officials say he was motivated by hatred for Islam and the conflict in Gaza.
It is unclear whether the suspect has had any direct contact with the boy's family.
A sign in the window of the apartment linked to the suspect shows Wadee Alfayoumi, a Palestinian-American boy who was murdered in 2023
Fry said that he hadn't talked with the suspect about politics, but said ""If I had, I would have talked him out of it.""
The suspect had been working at the American Osteopathic Information Association since 2024, according to online records examined by BBC Verify.
Social media accounts belonging to him indicate that he was heavily involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement.
An online story indicated that he was associated with a fringe communist group, The Party for Socialism and Liberation, in 2017, and had been interviewed as a member of the group.
In a post on X, the party said they ""have nothing to do with this shooting and do not support it"" and have had no contact with the suspect for seven years.
Police said they had no prior interactions with the suspect and had not seen anything in his background ""that would have placed him on our radar"".
The event at the Capital Jewish Museum had been billed as a networking opportunity to bring Jewish young professionals and the diplomatic community together. 
The organiser, American Jewish Committee, said it was open to those in the DC diplomatic community. The event's theme was advertised as ""turning pain into purpose"".
The event description said it invited humanitarian aid organisers responding to crises in the Middle East, including Gaza.
The location was only shared with those who signed up to attend.
President Donald Trump has condemned the attack and called it antisemitic.
Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, he said: ""These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, now! 
""Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. 
""So sad that such things as this can happen!  God bless you all!""
Netanyahu links DC shooting to the 7 Oct 2023 attacks on Israel
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""outraged by the horrifying antisemitic murder"" of the victims. 
His office said he had spoken to both victims' parents.
""My heart grieves for the families of the young beloveds, whose lives were cut short in a moment by an abhorrent antisemitic murderer,"" he said, adding he had directed Israeli embassies around the world to increase security.
He and Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar also said the deaths were caused by ""anti-Israeli incitement"" which they said was being carried out by European leaders.
Earlier this week, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada signed a strongly worded joint letter condemning Israel's actions in Gaza.
In a video address, Netanyahu linked Wednesday's killings in Washington to Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.
""As he was taken away, he chanted, 'Free Palestine!' This is exactly the same chant we heard on October 7th,"" Netanyahu said.
He accused Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney of ""emboldening Hamas to continue fighting forever"" by calling for Israel to end its war in Gaza.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.

Listen to Mike read this article
For the last five years, a loud hum has been a continual backdrop to birdsong and the occasional barking dog in the village of Dresden, New York state.
Coming from the nearby Greenidge Generation power plant, which had been mothballed for years before, the sound has angered some local people.
""It's an annoyance,"" says Ellen Campbell, who owns a house on Seneca Lake a short distance away. ""If I sit out by the lake, I would rather not hear that.
""We didn't sign up for the constant hum.""
The issue here in Dresden, a village of about 300 people surrounded by winding country roads, single-track rail lines and farms growing grapes and hops, sounds like a familiar story about the tension between nature-loving locals and economic development.
But their annoyance is also a signal of something less expected â policies of US President Donald Trump meeting resistance from people in the rural areas whose votes drove his return to the White House.
And the cause? Bitcoin mining.
An energy-intensive process that relies on powerful computers to create and protect the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin mining has grown rapidly in the country over recent years. The current administration, unlike Joe Biden's, is intent on encouraging the industry.
Trump has said he wants to turn the US into the crypto-mining capital of the world, announcing in June 2024 that ""we want all the remaining Bitcoin to be made in the USA"". This has implications for rural communities throughout the US â many of whom voted for Trump.
A Bitcoin mine started operating at Greenidge power plant in 2020
Installations like the one at the power plant near Dresden are appearing across the country, drawn by record-high cryptocurrency prices and cheap and abundant energy to power the computers that do the mining. There are at least 137 Bitcoin mines in the US across 21 states, and reports indicate there are many more planned. According to estimates by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Bitcoin mining uses up to 2.3% of the nation's grid.
The high energy use and its wider environmental impact is certainly causing some concern in Dresden.
But it's the unmistakable hum that is the soundtrack for discontent in many places with Bitcoin mines - produced by the fans used to cool the computers, it can range from a mechanical whirr to a deafening din.
""We can hear a constant buzzing,"" says another Dresden resident, Lori Fishline. ""It's a constant, loud humming noise that you just can't ignore. It was never present before and has definitely affected the peaceful atmosphere of our bay.""
Such is Ms Campbell's annoyance with Trump's Bitcoin backing, her political allegiance to the Republicans is being tested. ""Right now I'm not real happy about that party,"" she says.
The conflict in Seneca Lake is being played out nationwide, which could pose problems for a White House intent on pursuing a pro-cryptocurrency agenda.
A little over 100 miles west of Dresden, a backlash in the US border town of Niagara Falls prompted the local Mayor Robert Restaino - a Democrat - to issue a moratorium on new mining activity in December 2021, and the following year noise limits of 40 to 50 decibels near residential areas were imposed. He said: ""The noise pollution of this industry is like nothing else.""
Locals described the sound as similar to that of a 747 jet, or as grating as having a toothache 24 hours a day, claiming that the noise drowned out the sound of the nearby waterfalls.
And in Granbury, Texas, a 24ft-high sound barrier was erected in 2023 at a mining site after residents complained to public officials that the nonstop roar was keeping them awake and giving them migraines.
All these Bitcoin operations opened before Trump's return to the White House. But the opposition they have generated suggests public officials in Republican-voting areas are likely to find themselves coming under continued pressure from local people who oppose further Bitcoin mining expansion.
If this happens, could Trump's crypto dreams be derailed in his own backyard?
In the space of four years, Trump has reversed his stance on cryptocurrency
Less than four years ago, Trump said Bitcoin ""just seems like a scam"". Yet those reservations have now gone: the Trump family has since started the crypto firm World Liberty Financial, and Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP â 220 of its top buyers were invited to a private gala dinner with the president on Thursday.
Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr are behind a crypto mining venture called American Bitcoin, which plans to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and aims to build one of the world's largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining platforms, rooted in American soil.
Bitcoin mining has boomed in the US partly because of a crackdown in China in 2021, which was due to concerns over its environmental damage. Alexander Neumueller, an expert at the University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance, says that although it's hard to trace every last mine, it's clear that the US is now the leading Bitcoin producer, mining about 40% of the world's supply.
Greenidge Generation converted the plant near Dresden from coal-powered to gas-fired, before opening its Bitcoin mine in 2020
Dresden is in New York's Finger Lakes region â a rural area sliced through with deep glacial lakes, which attracts tourists drawn by its wineries, breweries and outdoor pursuits. In Yates County, home to Dresden and the Greenidge plant, around 60% of voters picked Trump last November.
According to the owners of the mine, Greenidge Generation, anywhere from 40 to 120 Bitcoin a month are being produced at the plant, along with some energy that flows back to the grid.
The company â which turned down requests for an interview â has argued that they converted a coal-burning operation into a relatively cleaner gas-fired power installation that complies with state environmental laws.
But amid public concern, New York state and Greenidge are currently engaged in a protracted legal battle over the plant's future. With some of the strictest environmental laws in the country, New York officials are challenging whether the gas-fired plant is permitted under the regulations that allowed the old coal plant. Power generation â and Bitcoin mining â has been allowed to continue during appeal proceedings.
Abi Buddington, who owns a house in Dresden and has been at the forefront of the fight against the crypto mine, says it has become a big issue locally.
""The climate changed, both environmentally as well as in our quiet little community,"" she says, recalling raised voices at contentious town hall meetings.
Ms Buddington is trying to change minds in Dresden and, through her network, elsewhere around the country.
""There are some who are environmentally concerned, and who may be Republican-leaning,"" she says. ""What we've found nationally is even in red states, once elected officials are educated properly and know the harms, they are very opposed.""
But not all are convinced. ""They've been a good corporate neighbour,"" says Dresden's recently elected mayor, Brian Flynn, about the mine. ""I'm pro-business, whether it be Greenidge or local agricultureâ¦ I think it's important to have a mix of both industry and recreation.""
Without a central bank or watchdog, Bitcoin operates on a decentralised system, relying on a network of miners with powerful computers 
Legal battles like the one in Seneca Lake are bringing home the realities of an industry that at first glance might seem contained to banks of data servers, removed from the real world.
Bitcoin ""miners"" â who are not actually extracting anything from the earth â verify transactions by solving extremely difficult cryptographic problems that require powerful computers. In return, they are rewarded with Bitcoin.
As the price of Bitcoin has shot up to its current value of around $100,000 (Â£75,000), ever-increasing amounts of computing power have been needed to win crypto rewards, shutting out smaller miners in favour of large collectives and companies.
As well as the hum, mining's energy use has environmental impacts. A Harvard study published in March in the peer-reviewed science journal Nature Communications found that Bitcoin mining exposes millions of Americans to harmful air pollution each year - and that 34 Bitcoin mines consumed a third more electricity than the city of LA. (There was some pushback from the crypto industry to the study, which was called The environmental burden of the United States' Bitcoin mining boom.)
According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, mining globally uses approximately 0.7% of global electricity consumption.
That has a knock-on effect on local energy prices, which is also provoking a backlash in some areas.
In 2017, Bitcoin miners flooded into Plattsburgh, New York â a city of about 20,000 people a couple of hours to the north of Dresden â because of cheap hydroelectricity rates. ""We were getting Bitcoin applications from operators all around the world,"" says the city's mayor at the time, Colin Read.
Yet they used so much power that electricity rates shot up. Within a year, some residents were paying up to 40% more during winter months, Read says.
The following year, he and other local lawmakers passed rules against buildings blasting out hot air.
""Fortunately we put a stop to it,"" he says, noting that all but one Bitcoin mining operation left the city.
Resistance to Bitcoin mines extends to places with the biggest Trump support.
Cyndie Roberson was retired and unaware of the crypto industry until a Bitcoin mining operation moved to her small town in North Carolina in 2021. The locals banded together and managed to ban new Bitcoin developments in their area - but the existing one was allowed to stay and the bitterness of the fight made her decide to move south, to Gilmer County in Georgia.
There, Ms Roberson has campaigned against crypto mining in a region that is solidly pro-Republican. In the county where she lives, she says that around 1,000 people came to a public meeting to oppose a mine, which then wasn't allowed to operate. 
Just north of Gilmer, the Fannin County Commission has enacted a ban on crypto mining, while a Georgian commission representing 18 primarily rural counties has published advice on how to restrict the development of Bitcoin mines.
""When you're in my backyard, when you're in my town, trying to wreck our property and our peace, people will tell you, it's a hard 'no',"" says Ms Roberson.
Although 80% of local people backed Trump last November, that support doesn't appear to stop people opposing one of his key crypto goals.
The Trump administration is not planning to do away with all regulations around crypto mining - but it is ready to actively help companies open power plants next to the mines.
In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine in April, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick said: ""We're going to make it so that if you want to mine Bitcoin, and you find the right place to do it, you can build your own power plant next to it,"" going on to argue that such projects would stop ""these stories about 'You're taking too much power and now the cost of operating my refrigerator is higher'.""
""The next generation of miners in America will be able to control their destiny, control the cost of power, and I think that is going to turbocharge Bitcoin mining in America,"" Lutnick told the magazine.
According to Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, a US think tank that researches emerging monetary networks, that process has already begun. ""There are states that are passing laws specifically prohibiting municipalities from banning Bitcoin mines,"" he says. ""It's a mechanism by which mining companies can fight back.""
And the nature of Bitcoin mining means that, if it meets resistance, it can quickly move on to somewhere more favourable.
When Colin Read tackled the mines in Plattsburgh, he saw how easily they could change location.
""This industry is really footloose,"" he said. ""When we told these companies they couldn't have more power without going through hoops, they packed up and went to a community where they didn't have such strict requirements.""
Local opposition is not Trump's only challenge. Could the sea, for example, be a better location for Bitcoin mining?
Mr Shapiro believes that, with miners looking for the lowest cost, they could turn to leftover renewable energy that can't be used by other applications. ""Wind power in the ocean can't be used to power a city, but you can set up an offshore platform that captures offshore wind and tidal energy, and use that to mine Bitcoin â because there's not another buyer to use that energy, it's probably ultimately where Bitcoin mining operations move.""
It could also be that in the cryptocurrency race, Bitcoin might not be the best bet. Read - who is an energy economist - is sceptical about the staying power of energy-intensive Bitcoin because he believes other more efficient alternatives are going to emerge.
With the White House egging on the industry, fights over Bitcoin mining will inevitably play out in smaller forums, in state and local governments and tiny places like Dresden.
But one constant in the short history of Bitcoin has been volatility. It might be boom times now â yet a downturn in the price, shifts in energy sources and changing crypto needs could fundamentally reshape the Bitcoin mining landscape, no matter how much Trump wants to keep it in the US.

Wednesday night's attack is being investigated as a hate crime, and more charges are expected, US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a news conference.
""This is a death penalty-eligible case,"" she said on Thursday, adding that it is too early to say whether prosecutors will decide to seek a death sentence.
Steve Jenson, from the FBI's Washington DC field office, called the killings ""an act of terror and directed violence against the Jewish community"".
Couple Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim were shot dead outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC around 21:08 local time (02:08 BST) on Wednesday, police said. The suspect opened fire on a group of four exiting the event, killing the two victims, police said.
Police identified the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago who had bought a ticket to the museum event about three hours before it began. He was arrested at the scene shortly after the shooting.
Shooting suspect Elias Rodriguez is seated as Magistrate Judge Matthew Sharbaugh presides in the US District Court in Washington DC
Witnesses said he was seen pacing outside the museum before opening fire. 
According to details in an affidavit, Elias Rodriguez initially opened fire on the victims, then reloaded and shot again ""several more times"" at closer range.
It said that when one victim tried to crawl away, he followed behind and fired again. 
Investigators recovered 21 spent 9mm cartridges at the scene. Police also found a handgun with its slide locked back, indicating it was empty, along with an empty magazine.
Eyewitnesses told the BBC he initially was mistaken for a traumatised bystander, and given aid inside the museum. 
One witness, Yoni Kalin, said people inside had been ""calming him down"". ""Little did we know he was somebody that executed people in cold blood,"" he said.
Police said the suspect also shouted ""free Palestine"" before he was taken into custody.
The suspect landed in the Washington DC area one day earlier, Jenson said, and investigators are still piecing together his whereabouts before the attack. According to an affidavit, officials believe he flew on Tuesday from Chicago to Washington DC for a work conference.
Social media accounts linked to the suspect show he worked at the American Osteopathic Information Association (AOIA) in Chicago as an administrative specialist since 2024.
At his court hearing Thursday, the suspect was charged and ordered to remain in detention. His next hearing was scheduled for 18 June.
Sarah Lynn Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky
Israel's ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter said shortly after the shooting that Mr Lischinsky planned to propose to Ms Milgrim during an upcoming trip they had planned to Jerusalem.
""They were a beautiful couple,"" Leiter said at a news conference.
A vigil for Ms Milgrim was expected on Thursday in her hometown of Kansas City. She previously had spoken out about her fears of antisemitism in American public life. In 2017, she was interviewed by a local TV station, external after her school in Kansas was vandalised with a Nazi swastika. 
""I worry about going to my synagogue, and now I have to worry about safety at school and that shouldn't be a thing,"" said Ms Milgrim, who was in her final year of high school at the time.
Police said the suspect was not on their radar and has no prior interactions with law enforcement. They said he admitted to the attack and is believed to have acted alone.
The gun used in the attack was a 9mm handgun legally purchased in Illinois in March 2020 and brought to Washington in his checked luggage. Illinois has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the US.
Social media accounts linked to the suspect also indicate that he was heavily involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement. Investigators said they were working to authenticate writings online purportedly authored by him, accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, criticising US policy and discussing the use of political violence.
The affidavit said that in an interview with detectives, Elias Rodriguez referenced a 2024 incident in which a man set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington DC, expressing admiration for the act and calling the man a ""martyr"" for his protest over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A home linked to the suspect in Chicago was seen being searched on Thursday, and authorities also said they were scouring his electronic devices.
One of his neighbours in Chicago, John Wayne Fry, told reporters that he lived in the same apartment building as the suspect for around a year. 
The suspect displayed a photo outside his flat of a Palestinian-American child who was killed in Chicago in 2023, Mr Fry said.
The man who killed six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi was convicted of hate crime charges earlier this month. Officials said he was motivated by hatred for Islam and the conflict in Gaza.
It is unclear whether the suspect had any direct contact with the boy's family.
Jojo Kalin, one of the event's organisers in Washington DC,  told the BBC that the event the victims attended was focused on how to build a coalition to help people suffering in Gaza amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.
She added it is ""deeply ironic that what we were discussing was bridge building and then we were all hit over the head with such hatred"".
The attack was condemned by world leaders, including UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said he ""thoroughly"" condemns the ""antisemitic attack"" in Washington DC.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack ""a heinous antisemitic murder"" and added that security would be increased for Israeli representatives and diplomatic missions worldwide.
US President Donald Trump also decried antisemitism in response to the attack, writing on his social media platform Truth Social that ""hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA.""
Trump and Netanyahu later spoke over the phone about the incident, where the US president expressed sorrow to his Israeli counterpart, according to a readout of the call.

185,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czelypr8jdlo,2025-05-22 22:54:13,"Homebound: The Indian film that got a nine-minute ovation at Cannes,","Ghaywan's new film Homebound received a nine-minute standing ovation at  the Cannes Film Festival
In 2010, Indian filmmaker Neeraj Ghaywan made a striking debut at Cannes with Masaan -  a poignant tale of love, loss, and the oppressive grip of the caste system, set against the holy city of Varanasi.
The main lead in the film (Vicky Kaushal) performed a job assigned to one of the lowest castes in the rigid Hindu caste hierarchy â cremating dead bodies along the Ganges. Masaan played in the ""Un Certain Regard"" section at the festival, which looks at films with unusual styles and or that tells non-traditional stories. It won the FIPRESCI, external and the Avenir - also known as the Promising Future Prize - prizes.
Since then, Ghaywan was in search of a story about India's marginalised communities. Five years ago in the middle of the pandemic, a friend, Somen Mishra - the head of creative development at Dharma Productions in Mumbai - recommended an opinion piece, external called Taking Amrit Home, published in The New York Times. It was written by the journalist Basharat Peer. 
What drew Ghaywan to Peer's article was that it tracked the journeys - sometimes of hundreds or even thousands of miles - taken by millions of Indians who travelled on foot to get home during the nation's strict lockdown during the pandemic. But he was also drawn to the core of the story, which focused on the childhood friendship between two men â one Muslim and the other Dalit (formerly known as the untouchables).
Ghaywan's new film Homebound, inspired by Peer's article, premiered at Cannes Film Festival's ""Un Certain Regard"" section this week, ending with a nine-minute long standing ovation. 

Bollywood actor Janhvi Kapoor plays a key role in the film
Many in the audience were seen wiping away tears. Ghaywan gave the lead producer Karan Johar a tight hug, while he and his young lead actors â Ishan Khatter, Vishal Jethwa and Janhvi Kapoor - came together in a larger group hug later. 
Since this was the biggest South Asian event at Cannes 2025, other film luminaries showed up to support the screening. India's Mira Nair (who won the Camera d'Or in 1988 for Salaam Bombay) leaned across two rows of seats to reach out to Johar. Pakistan's Siam Sadiq (who won the Un Certain Regard Jury Prize in 2022 for Joyland) was seen making a reel of the mood inside the theatre that he later posted on Instagram.
The film also received backing from a rather unexpected quarter. Its main producer is Johar, the leading Indian commercial filmmaker (known for blockbuster films like Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham and the recent Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani). But last month Martin Scorsese stepped in as the executive producer after he was introduced to the film by the French producer MÃ©lita Toscan du Plantier.
This is the first time Scorsese has stepped in to support a contemporary Indian film. Until now he has only backed restored classic Indian films. 
""I have seen Neeraj's first film Masaan in 2015 and I loved it, so when MÃ©lita Toscan du Plantier sent me the project of his second film, I was curious,"" Scorsese said in a statement last month. 
""I loved the story, the culture and was willing to help. Neeraj has made a beautifully crafted film that's a significant contribution to Indian cinema.""
The film follows the bond between two men played by Ishan Khatter and Vishal Jethwa
According to Ghaywan, Scorsese helped nurture the film by mentoring the team through a number of rounds of edits. But he also tried to understand the cultural context which helped the exchange of ideas.
The context was important to Ghaywan, since he had been trying to capture the right spirit of the subject he was tackling. 
The film's two lead characters â Mohammed Shoaib Ali (Khatter) and Chandan Kumar (Jethwa) have shared histories â the weight of centuries of discrimination at the hand of upper caste Hindus, but also similar goals to rise above the barriers imposed on them - in this case by joining their state's police force.
Ghaywan has openly shared that he was born into a Dalit family - a reality that has cast a long shadow over his life, haunting him since childhood.  
As an adult, he went on to study business administration and then worked in a corporate job in Gurgaon outside the capital, Delhi. He said he never faced discrimination but was acutely aware of his position in the caste hierarchy and still lives with the weight of where he was born. 
""I am the only acknowledged person from the community who is there behind and in the front of camera in all of Hindi cinema history. That is the kind of gap we are living with,"" he says.
Critics say Homebound's seamless blend of fiction and reality has produced a powerful public document
A majority of India lives in its villages, but Hindi filmmakers rarely talk about bringing the villages to their stories, says Ghaywan. What also offends him is that marginalised communities are only talked about as statistics. 
""What if we pick one person out of that statistic and see what happened in their lives?"" he says. ""How did they get to this point? I felt it was worth narrating a story.""
When he sat down to write the script, he tried to fictionalise the backstories of the two protagonists until the point that they took the journey during Covid â which is the beginning of Peer's article.
As a child in Hyderabad, Ghaywan had a close Muslim friend, Asghar, so he felt deeply connected to Ali and Kumar's lived experiences in the film.
""What appealed to me more was the humanity behind it, the interpersonal, the interiority of the relationship,"" he says, that took him back to his childhood in Hyderabad.
In Ghaywan's hands, Homebound has the wonderful glow and warmth of the winter sun. It is gorgeously shot in India's rural North, capturing simple joys and the daily struggles of its Muslim and Dalit protagonists. The two men, the woman one of them loves (Kapoor and Jethwa both portray Dalit characters), and their interactions offer much to reflect on and understand.
For the most part, Ghaywan's script keeps viewers on the edge. Back in 2019, none of us truly grasped the scale of the coming pandemic - but the film subtly foreshadows a shift, reminding us that a crisis can cut across class, caste, and ethnicity, touching everyone.
Homebound's seamless blend of fiction and reality has produced a powerful public document, grounding its characters in authenticity. More than just moving its audience to tears, the film is bound to spark meaningful conversations - and, one hopes, a deeper understanding of those who live in the shadows."
186,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9wg5pg1xp5o,2025-05-15 23:15:50,"Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?,","US President Donald Trump confronted South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday over widely discredited claims that genocide is being committed against white people.
A week after the US rankled South Africa by granting asylum to nearly 60 Afrikaners, Ramaphosa visited the White House to reset the countries' relations.
Instead Trump put his counterpart on the defensive with claims that white farmers in his nation were being killed and ""persecuted"".
The South African government allowed the US embassy to consider the asylum applications inside the country, and let the group board a chartered flight from the main international airport in Johannesburg - not scenes normally associated with refugees fleeing persecution.
South African History Online sums up their identity by pointing out that ""the modern Afrikaner is descended mainly from Western Europeans who settled on the southern tip of Africa during the middle of the 17th Century"".
A mixture of Dutch (34.8%), German (33.7%) and French (13.2%) settlers, they formed a ""unique cultural group"" which identified itself ""completely with African soil"", South African History Online noted, external.
Their language, Afrikaans, is quite similar to Dutch.
But as they planted their roots in Africa, Afrikaners, as well as other white communities, forced black people to leave their land. 
Afrikaners are also known as Boers, which actually means farmer, and the group is still closely associated with farming.
In 1948, South Africa's Afrikaner-led government introduced apartheid, or apartness, taking racial segregation to a more extreme level. 
This included laws which banned marriages across racial lines, reserved many skilled and semi-skilled jobs for white people, and forced black people to live in what were called townships and homelands. 
They were also denied a decent education, with Afrikaner leader Hendrik Verwoerd infamously remarking in the 1950s that ""blacks should never be shown the greener pastures of education. They should know their station in life is to be hewers of wood and drawers of water"".
Afrikaner dominance of South Africa ended in 1994, when black people were allowed to vote for the first time in a nationwide election, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) to power.
Afrikaners currently number more than 2.5 million out of a population of more than 60 million - about 4%. 
Afrikaners make up about 4% of South Africa's population
None of South Africa's political parties - including those that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general - have claimed that there is a genocide in South Africa. 
But such claims have been circulating among right-wing groups for many years, and during his first term, Trump referred to the ""large scale killing of farmers"" in South Africa. 
Some white farmers have been killed but a lot of misleading information has been circulated online. 
In February, a South African judge dismissed the idea of a genocide as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen.
South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. 
Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.
Defending his decision to give Afrikaners refugee status, Trump said that a ""genocide"" was taking place in South Africa, white farmers were being ""brutally killed"" and their ""land is being confiscated"".
South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa has said it was ""completely false"" to claim that ""people of a certain race or culture are being targeted for persecution"".
Referring to the first group who have moved to the US, Ramaphosa previously said: ""They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution.""
At a meeting at the White House in May, Trump ambushed his counterpart by playing videos which he claimed showed proof of a genocide. The videos included an opposition politician singing a song that some say evokes violence against white South Africans. 
Ramaphosa, who had brought white South African golfers to the meeting to meet Trump, condemned what was shown in the video and also explained to Trump that South Africa allows free expression.
Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted'
Trump also displayed photos of white people he said had been murdered, prompting Ramaphosa to remind him that such crimes affect people of any race.
The White House meeting was also attended by Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa.
Leaving the White House, Ramaphosa said he thought the meeting had gone well, and that Trump still has some doubts as to whether a genocide is taking place. 
Watch moment Trump confronts South Africa's president with video
Trump also said he was not sure how he could attend the G20 summit of world leaders, due to be held in South Africa later this year, in such an environment. 
The government denies that land is being confiscated from farmers, saying that a bill Ramaphosa signed into law in January was aimed at addressing the land dispossession that black people faced during white-minority rule. 
But the law has been condemned by the Democratic Alliance (DA), Ramaphosa's main coalition partner in government. The DA say it will challenge the law in South Africa's highest court, as it threatens property rights. 
Musk has referred to the country's ""racist ownership laws"", alleging that his satellite internet service provider Starlink was ""not allowed to operate in South Africa simply because I'm not black"".
To operate in South Africa, Starlink needs to obtain network and service licences, which both require 30% ownership by historically disadvantaged groups.
This mainly refers to South Africa's majority black population, which was shut out of the economy during the racist system of apartheid.
The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) - a regulatory body in the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors - told the BBC that Starlink had never submitted an application for a licence.
Musk has also accused the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the fourth-largest party in South Africa, of ""actively promoting"" a genocide through a song it sings at its rallies.
Racially charged row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink
Julius Malema is a controversial politician who advocates the nationalisation of land in South Africa
EFF leader Julius Malema's trademark song is ""Shoot the Boer, Shoot the farmer"", which he sings at political rallies. 
Afrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, saying it was highly inflammatory and amounted to hate speech. 
However, South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that Malema is within his rights to sing the lyrics - first popularised during the anti-apartheid struggle - at political rallies.
The court ruled that a ""reasonably well-informed person"" would understand that when ""protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence"".
Instead, the song was a ""provocative way"" of advancing the EFF's political agenda - which was to end ""land and economic injustice"".
Lobby group AfriForum filed an appeal against the ruling, but South Africa's highest court refused to hear the case, saying it had little chance of succeeding.
In 2023, South Africa's former President Thabo Mbeki urged Malema to stop singing the song, saying it was no longer politically relevant as the anti-apartheid struggle was over. 
The ANC says it no longer sings it, but it cannot ""prescribe to other political parties what they must sing"". 
Even though white-minority rule ended in 1994, its effects are still being felt.
Average living standards are far higher for the white community than black people.
White people occupy 62.1% of top management posts, despite only accounting for 7.7% of the country's economically active population, according to a recent report by South Africa's Commission for Employment Equity.
The government has tried to change this through what it calls ""economic empowerment"" and ""employment equity"" laws.
An amended version of the second act includes strict targets for companies aimed at increasing the number of non-white employees.
While these laws have been welcomed by many South Africans, some members of racial minorities feel they make it harder for them to get jobs and government contracts. There has also been criticism that they can lead to corruption, for example when business opportunities are given to friends and relatives of officials.
Among the critics have been the Democratic Alliance, which despite being part of the governing coalition, recently challenged the amended Employment Equity Act in court, saying it would ""make far more people marginalised in our economy than they already are"".
Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie recently came under fire when a job in his department was advertised as being only open to the Coloured, Asian and white populations. 
He defended this move, saying he was applying the Employment Equity Act and ensuring ""all races are represented"", because most of the people in his department were black.
Some Afrikaners see US President Donald Trump as an ally
It doesn't look like it.
In March, a business group said that close to 70,000 Afrikaners had expressed interest in moving to the US following Trump's offer - from an estimated population of 2.5 million.
The US embassy in South Africa then released a statement clarifying the criteria for resettlement, saying it covered people from any racial minority, not just Afrikaners, who could cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future.
One Afrikaner who moved to the US told BBC News that he is grateful to Trump for granting him asylum. 
""I felt finally somebody in this world is seeing what's going on,"" said Charl Kleinhaus.
The BBC's Nomia Iqbal asks an Afrikaner about his refugee status in the US and about being called a ""coward""
South Africa's most recent census, done in 2022, shows that Coloureds, (an officially used term meaning people of mixed racial origin) are the largest minority, making up 8% of the population. They are followed by white people, including Afrikaners, at 7%, and Asians at 3%. 
After Trump's offer, Afrikaner lobby group Solidarity posted an article on its website headlined: ""Ten historical reasons to stay in South Africa"". 
In parliament, the leader of the right-wing Freedom Front Plus party said they were committed to South Africa. 
""We are bound to Africa and will build a future for ourselves and our children here,"" CornÃ© Mulder said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration had revoked Harvard's ""Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification as a result of their failure to adhere to the law."" 
""Let this serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country,"" she wrote on X on Thursday.
Harvard called the move ""unlawful"" in a statement.
""We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host our international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the University â and this nation â immeasurably,"" the university responded.
""We are working quickly to provide guidance and support to members of our community. This retaliatory action threatens serious harm to the Harvard community and our country, and undermines Harvard's academic and research mission.""
The Trump administration's decisions could affect thousands of international students who study at the university. Over 6,700 international students were enrolled at the institution last academic year, university data shows, making up 27% of its student body. 
News quickly spread through the international community on campus Thursday, sparking fear and frustration among the thousands of students whose futures were suddenly in limbo.
""We're seeing a lot of confusion on this,"" Sarah Davis, an Australian student receiving a graduate degree, told BBC Newshour. 
""The news has come only five days before a lot of us are due to graduate the university, and this obviously is going to have a lot of very uncertain implications for whether we're able to stay on in the United States afterwards and keep working here,"" said Ms Davis, who is president of the Australia and New Zealand Caucus at the Harvard Kennedy School.
""We're all just sitting back and waiting to see whether or not we get communications about what the next steps are from the university.""
Leo GerdÃ©n, a 22-year-old undergraduate from Sweden, remembers the day he received his admission letter to Harvard as the best day of his life. With less than a week until graduation, he didn't imagine his time at the prestigious campus ending like this.
""International students are being used as poker chips in a battle between the White House and Harvard,"" Mr GerdÃ©n told the BBC. ""It's incredibly dehumanising.""
The Trump administration has launched investigations into dozens of universities across the countries and wrung concessions from other major US institutions like Columbia University in New York.
But in April, Harvard University became the most prominent institution to push back, announcing it would sue the Trump administration after it sent the school a list of lengthy demands. The White House later said the list was sent by mistake. 
It has demanded Harvard change its hiring, admissions and teaching practices to help fight antisemitism on campus. It has threatened to revoke the university's tax-exempt status and freeze billions of dollars in government grants.
Harvard earlier this year said it had taken many steps to address antisemitism, and that the government's demands were an effort to regulate the university's ""intellectual conditions"". 
But the standoff continued to escalate.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) then warned Harvard that it could lose its ability to host international students if it did not comply with a sweeping records request from the administration pertaining to international students.
In Thursday's letter,, external Noem followed through. She announced that DHS had revoked Harvard's access to the SEVP programme, which meant that it would not be able to enroll individuals with F- or J- non-immigrant status for the upcoming 2025-2026 academic year. 
Individuals on these visas would have to transfer to other universities to maintain legal status, she wrote.
The letter stated Harvard had 72 hours to comply with a list of demands to have an ""opportunity"" to regain its ability to enrol these students. 
That included providing the government with all disciplinary records for non-immigrant students enrolled at Harvard over the past five years. Noem also demanded Harvard turn over electronic records, videos, or audio of ""illegal"" and ""dangerous or violent"" activity by non-immigrant students on campus.
In her post on X, Noem warned that the move should ""serve as a warning to all universities and academic institutions across the country.""
The Trump administration has attempted to curtail individual visas for international students, causing confusion on university campuses across the US and leading to a wave of lawsuits.
In some cases, those revocations appeared to affect foreign students who participated in political protests or have had previous criminal charges, such as driving infractions.
In a separate court case on Thursday, a federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration from cancelling the legal status of international students across the US while challenges to the policy play out in court. 
""We came here because of what America stands for: freedom of speech, academic freedom, a vibrant intellectual community,"" Mr GerdÃ©n said of his international classmates. ""And now Trump is threatening all those values.""
""Without the international students, Harvard is simply not Harvard anymore,"" he said.

Walk into any Starbucks in South Korea right now, and there are some names you definitely won't be hearing. 
Six to be exact - and they happen to be the names of the candidates running in the upcoming presidential race. 
That's because Starbucks has temporarily blocked customers who are ordering drinks from using these names, which would be called out by baristas.
The company said it needed to ""maintain political neutrality during election season"", adding that this would be lifted after the election on 3 June. 
South Korean businesses and celebrities usually strive to be seen as neutral. But it has become more crucial in recent months, as political turmoil triggered by   former president Yoon Suk Yeol left the country more divided than ever.
Now, as South Korea gears up to pick its new president following Yoon's impeachment, even the most mundane things can become politicised - a lesson Starbucks has learnt the hard way.
In recent months, it has seen an increasing number of customers ordering drinks through their app and keying in phrases such as ""arrest Yoon Suk Yeol"" or ""[opposition leader] Lee Jae-myung is a spy"" as their nicknames. 
Starbucks baristas had little choice but to yell out these names once the drinks were ready for collection.
""Our goal is to make sure every customer has a great experience in our coffeehouses,"" Starbucks said in a statement about its new move to ban the six presidential candidates' names.
""To help with that, we sometimes block certain phrases that could be misunderstood by our employees or customers â like names of political candidates with messages of support or opposition during election season to maintain neutrality.""
But this marks the first time it has banned the names of all the candidates running in an election. Besides Lee, the other names are Kim Moon-soo, Lee Jun-seok, Kwon Young-kook, Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin-ho.
Some think the coffee giant is taking things a bit too far.
""I think people are being too sensitive. What if your real name is the same as a candidate's?"" said 33-year-old Jang Hye-mi.
Ji Seok-bin, a 27-year-old who is a regular at Starbucks, said he thought the rule was ""too trivial"", though he said he understood the logic behind it given the country's heightened political tensions. 
""After [Yoon's impeachment] I don't really talk about politics anymore. It feels like the ideological divide has grown so much that conversations often turn into arguments.""
Ji Seok-bin says Starbucks' new rule is a bit too 'trivial'
Starbucks is not alone. The country's biggest search engine, Naver, has disabled autocomplete and related search suggestions for candidates, as it usually does  during election season.
A search on Google for Lee, who is widely tipped to win the election, yields phrases like ""Lee Jae-myung trial"" - a reference to the fact that he is currently embroiled in several criminal trials. 
A search for the country's conservative presidential candidate Kim Moon-soo brings up a related suggestion for ""conversion"", as he is widely seen to have ""converted"" from being a fervent labour activist to a conservative politician. 
Naver said it decided to do this to ""provide more accurate and fair information during the election campaign"". 
Celebrities and public figures are also being extra careful, as they are held to high standards of political impartiality. Even the clothes they wear during election time would be highly scrutinised. 
Wearing colours like blue and red - which represent the country's liberal Democratic Party (DP) and conservative People's Power Party (PPP) respectively - has in the past been enough to trigger online backlash. 
Sometimes, even a baseball cap or necktie alone is enough to spark accusations of partisan support. 
During the last presidential election in 2022, Kim Hee-chul of K-pop group Super Junior was accused of being a PPP supporter when he was spotted wearing red slippers and a pink mask.
Last year, Shinji, lead vocalist of the popular trio Koyote, posted a black and white workout photo on Instagram a day before the general election, with the caption that she ""made the photo black and white... [after] seeing the colour of my sweatpants.""
""Funny and sad at the same time,"" she added. 
Some celebrities go even further, deliberately wearing a mix of red and blue.
Some celebrities deliberately wear a mix of red and blue  - while others avoid colour entirely
One makeup artist with over a decade of experience working with K-pop stars and actors told the BBC that during elections, styling teams steer clear of politically symbolic colours. 
""We usually stick to neutral tones like black, white, or grey,"" said the make-up artist, who declined to be named. 
Celebrities even have to be careful when striking a pose, she added. 
Flashing the peace sign for a photo? That could be read as the number two - and thus an endorsement of a political candidate. In South Korea, election candidates are each assigned a number.
Dr Cho Jin-man, of Duksung Women's University, says it is ""important to be able to talk about different things without crossing the line, and to be able to recognise and understand differences"".
But with so much division in the country, he adds that many are choosing to ""remain silent to remain politically neutral""."
189,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0eqpz23l9jo,2025-05-22 20:58:15,"A look at the key items in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill',","House Speaker Mike Johnson led the charge to pass Republican's ""big, beautiful bill""
House Republicans have narrowly passed a sweeping tax and spending bill and delivered a major victory to President Donald Trump.
It includes extended tax cuts, added requirements for federal benefits eligibility, and an increase to the national debt ceiling - all major sticking points that were agreed upon by a 215-214 vote in the House on Thursday morning.
The more than 1,000-page bill now heads to the Senate, which will have the chance to approve or change provisions of the bill before it reaches Trump's desk.
Here is a look at some of the key items in the bill.
On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security income - monthly payments to people with disabilities and older adults. 
The House bill fell short of delivering on that promise, but it did temporarily increase the standard deduction of up to $4,000 (Â£2,983) for individuals 65 and over. That deduction would be in place from 2025 to 2028.
The deduction extensions begin to decrease after $150,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and $75,000 for individual filers.
To help finance tax cuts elsewhere, Republicans have added additional restrictions and requirements for Medicaid, the health care programme relied upon by millions of elderly, disabled and low-income Americans.
Changes to Medicaid - one of the biggest components of federal spending - was a major source of political strife that caused significant disagreement among lawmakers. 
One of the changes are new work requirements for childless adults without disabilities. To qualify, the bill says, they would be required to work at least 80 hours per month beginning December 2026.
Another change to the programme was requiring re-enrollment to shift from once per year to every six months. Enrollees will also have to provide additional income and residency verifications.
The bill increases the deduction limit for state and local taxes (Salt), a hugely important issue for a few Republican holdouts in some Democrat-controlled urban areas.
There is currently a $10,000 cap on how much taxpayers can deduct from the amount they owe in federal taxes. That expires this year. 
In the new bill, House Republicans have raised the Salt limit to $40,000 for married couples with incomes up to $500,000.
This, too, was a major point of contention. 
A 2017 law passed under the last Trump administration held the cap at $10,000 and was designed to make room in the federal budget to allow for tax breaks elsewhere. 
Reforms have also been added to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (Snap), the government programme used by over 40 million low-income Americans.
The new bill requires states to contribute more to the programme, which is also partially funded by the federal government.
It also adds work requirements for able-bodied Snap enrollees who do not have dependents. 
The bill makes good on one of Trump's signature campaign promises -  ending taxes on tips and overtime pay. Both were successfully included in the bill.
The plan would also allow Americans to deduct interest on car loans for US-made cars only.
The child tax credit is also set to increase to $2,500 from $2,000 through to 2028, exclusively for Americans with social security numbers.
Additionally, the bill proposes increasing the debt ceiling to $4tn (Â£2.9tn). The debt ceiling is the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow to pay its bills.
Lifting the debt limit allows the government to pay for programmes already approved by Congress. 
The Senate must approve the bill and could make changes, which some have already signalled they intend to do. 
If that happens, it will return to the House for another high-stakes vote.
Trump is urging the Senate to get on board. 
""It's time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work, and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!"" the president wrote on social media on Thursday.
Democrats, who have neither a majority in the House nor Senate, have criticised the bill, particularly on changes to Medicaid and Snap. 
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called it a ""reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam"" and pledged to use the bill against Republicans in next year's midterm elections."
190,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdyv3jp5elo,2025-05-22 10:46:25,"UN says 90 lorry loads of aid now in Gaza after three-day delay at crossing,","The BBC's Wyre Davies sees urgently needed Gaza aid going through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing
More than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade.
The aid, which included flour, baby food and medical equipment, was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing on Wednesday night and taken to warehouses for distribution. Several bakeries began producing bread with the flour on Thursday.
The UN said the delays were due to a lack of security along the single access route approved by Israel's military.
Israeli authorities said they allowed an additional 100 lorry loads through Kerem Shalom on Wednesday. However, the UN said it was ""nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza"".
About 500 lorries entered the territory on average every day before the war, the UN has said. 
Humanitarian organisations have warned of acute levels of hunger among the 2.1 million population, amid significant shortages of basic foods and skyrocketing prices.
Palestinian Authority Health Minister Majed Abu Ramadan, who is based in the occupied West Bank, told reporters on Thursday that 29 children and elderly people had died from ""starvation-related"" causes in the last couple of days, according to Reuters news agency. 
Half a million people face starvation in the coming months, an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has said.
A UN World Food Programme (WFP) official said the UN and its partners had over 140,000 tonnes of food - about 6,000 lorry loads and enough to feed the entire population for two months - in position at aid corridors and ready to be brought into Gaza at scale.
Israel stopped all deliveries of aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the 58 hostages still held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
Israel has insisted that there has been no shortage of aid and has accused Hamas of stealing supplies to give to its fighters or sell to raise money - an allegation the group denied. The UN also denied that aid had been diverted.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated the claim on Thursday, saying in a statement: ""I say to President Macron, Prime Minister Carney and Prime Minister Starmer: When mass murderers, rapists, baby killers and kidnappers thank you, you're on the wrong side of justice.""
Netanyahu said the leaders of France, Canada and the UK had ""bought into Hamas's propaganda that says Israel is starving Palestinian children"".
He reiterated that Israel and the US would set up their own aid delivery to be done through American companies in Gaza, bypassing the UN and other aid suppliers. 
Netanyahu had previously said he was allowing in a limited amount of food so that the Israeli military could continue its newly expanded ground offensive and take full control of the Palestinian territory.
He said on Thursday that construction of the first distribution zones in the scheme would be completed ""in the coming days"".
The UN and other agencies have said they will not co-operate with US-Israeli plan, saying it contradicts fundamental humanitarian principles and appears to ""weaponise aid"".
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had brought in one lorry load of medical supplies for the Red Cross field hospital in the southern city of Rafah, but that more was needed.
""A trickle of trucks is woefully inadequate. Only the rapid, unimpeded, and sustained flow of aid can begin to address the full scope of needs on the ground,"" it said.
Mandy Blackman, the nurse in charge of running the charity UK-Med's field hospital in the southern al-Mawasi area, described the situation in Gaza as ""heart-breaking"", with food in perilously short supply.
She told the BBC that patients arriving at the hospital were ""visibly thinner"" than during her previous two stints there, and that staff were only able to offer them one meal a day, consisting of rice with some pulses.
""People are having to relocate constantly and are not able to feed their children. No-one knows what's going to happen the next day. There's constant suffering and constant anxiety,"" she said.
Palestinian workers were pictured unloading sacks of flour at a bakery in the southern city of Khan Younis overnight
Before the aid entered Gaza, senior WFP official Antoine Renard had told the BBC that the problems with collecting it arose because the Israeli military wanted lorries to move along a route which aid agencies considered to be dangerous. 
The route, he said, could leave them at risk of attack by desperately hungry civilians and armed criminal gangs.
""At market prices in Gaza right now, each truck full of flour is worth around $400,000 (Â£298,000),"" Mr Renard explained.
He added that the solution would be ""hundreds of trucks daily"" travelling along a safe route to warehouses, noting ""the less we provide, the greater the risk and more anxiety created"" among the population.
Mr Renard said aid agencies on the Gaza side did not employ armed guards to accompany their cargoes because it was considered too dangerous, so a lengthy ceasefire and an extension of the current five-day window for the transfer of food was urgently needed.
According to Mr Renard, bringing in at least 100 aid lorries daily would only meet the ""very minimum"" of the population's food needs.
The UN said the aid was ""nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza""
Meanwhile, Israeli bombardment and ground operations are continuing across Gaza, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting on Thursday that 107 people were killed over the previous 24 hours.
At least 52 people have been killed since dawn on Thursday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. Palestinian media reported that they included 16 people, most of them members of one extended family, who died when a home was hit in Jabalia, in northern Gaza.
The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for Jabalia and 13 other northern neighbourhoods on Thursday, warning residents that it was ""operating with intense force in your areas, as terrorist organisations continue their activities and operations"".
According to the UN, about 81% of the territory is now either subject to Israeli evacuation orders or located in militarized ""no-go"" zones.
Almost 600,000 people are estimated to have been displaced again since March, including 161,000 who have been forced to flee in the past week.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. 
At least 53,762 people, including 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry."
191,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9vxve994ro,2025-05-22 12:12:16,"Fact-checking Trump's Oval Office confrontation with Ramaphosa,","Donald Trump confronted President Cyril Ramaphosa during a tense exchange in the White House on Wednesday, with a series of contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa.
The meeting - at first warm and light-hearted - quickly changed tone as Trump asked his staff to play a video mostly showing South African opposition politician Julius Malema chanting a song calling for violence against white farmers.
The video also included footage showing rows of crosses, which he claimed was a burial site for murdered white farmers, and presented Ramaphosa with copies of articles which he said documented widespread brutality against South Africa's white minority.
Supporters of the Trump administration have long amplified claims of violence against the white minority, notably Elon Musk and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who ran segments on the supposed genocide during the president's first term. Some of these claims are demonstrably false.
The footage played by Trump in the Oval Office showed rows of white crosses stretching off into the distance along a rural road. Trump claimed: ""These are burial sites right here. Burial sites. Over a thousand of white farmers.""
However, the crosses do not mark graves. The video is from a protest against the murder of white farming couple Glen and Vida Rafferty, who were ambushed and shot dead on their premises in 2020. The clip was shared on YouTube on 6 September, the day after the protests.
""It's not a burial site, but it was a memorial,"" Rob Hoatson, one of the organisers of the event, told the BBC. He said the crosses were erected as a ""temporary memorial"" to the couple. 
Trump referred to this clip showing rows of crosses on a rural road
Mr Hoatson said the crosses have since been taken down. 
BBC Verify has geolocated the footage to an area in KwaZulu-Natal province, near the town of Newcastle. Google Street View imagery captured in May 2023 - almost three years after the footage first appeared online - shows that the crosses were no longer standing.
In the meeting, Trump said: ""A lot of people are very concerned with regard to South Africaâ¦ we have many people that feel they're being persecuted, and they are coming to the US, so we take from many locations if we feel there's persecution or genocide going on.""
He has previously made claims about ""white genocide"" several times before and appeared to be referring to that.
At a press briefing earlier this month he said: ""It's a genocide that's taking place"" referring to killing of white farmers in South Africa.

The country has one of the highest murder rates in the world. There were 26,232 murders last year, according to South African Police Service (SAPS) figures.
Of these, 44 were killings of people within the farming community and of those, eight were of farmers.
These figures are not broken down by race in any public stats release that we've been able to locate - but they clearly don't provide evidence for the claims of ""white genocide"" made repeatedly by Trump.
In February, a South African judge dismissed the idea of a genocide as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"".
The Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU), which represents farmers, compiles figures which offer an insight into the racial identity of the victims. The TAU relies on media reports, social media posts and reports from their members.
Their figures for last year show there were 23 white people killed in farm attacks, and nine black people. So far this year TAU has recorded three white people and four black people killed on South African farms.
During the tense meeting, Trump played footage from political rallies in which participants sang ""Kill the Boer"" - a controversial anti-apartheid song that critics say calls for violence against white farmers. 
South African courts had categorised the song as hate speech, but recent judgements have ruled that it can be legally sung at rallies as judges say it makes a political point and does not directly invoke violence.
Trump said that those leading the singing were ""officials"" and ""people that were in office"".
One of the men leading the rally was Julius Malema, who previously led the ruling ANC's youth wing. In 2012 he left the party and has never held an official government position.  He now leads a party called the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) which won 9.5% in last year's election, entering opposition against the new multi-party coalition.
Julius Malema split from the ANC in 2012, later forming the EFF
Responding to Trump's accusations, Ramaphosa emphasised that the EFF is ""a small minority party"" and said that ""our government policy is completely against what he was saying"".
Another man in the video who can be heard singing the lyric ""shoot the Boer"" at a different rally is former President Jacob Zuma, who left office in 2018. The video is from 2012 when he was president. The ANC promised to stop singing the song shortly afterwards.
Zuma subsequently left the ANC and now leads the opposition uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which won more than 14% in last year's election.
During the meeting, Trump held up a series of articles which he claimed showed evidence of white farmer killings in South Africa.
There was an image clearly visible as Trump spoke and said: ""Look, here's burial sites all over the place. These are all white farmers that are being buried.""
But the image isn't from South Africa - it's actually from a report about women being killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The French news agency (AFP) initially pointed out the image, and BBC Verify ran a search and confirmed it as being from a Reuters news agency clip filmed in the DR Congo city of Goma in February.

192,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce80zg9d76lo,2025-05-22 19:27:39,"Erdogan denies bid to change Turkey's constitution means he'll run as president again,","Recep Tayyip Erdogan's third term as president runs out in 2028 and he is trailing in the opinion polls
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denied he is trying to change the constitution so that he can stay on when his term ends in three years' time.
Erdogan has led Turkey for 22 years, first as prime minister from 2003 and then as its elected president since 2014. But he cannot run again unless the rules are changed or he calls early elections.
""We want the new constitution not for ourselves, but for our country. I have no interest in being re-elected or running for office again,"" he told reporters on Thursday.
And yet Erdogan's recent remarks and actions have heightened speculation that he wants to remain president after his term ends in 2028.
Last January he was asked by a singer if he was up for running for another term and he said, ""I am, if you are.""  The next day his party's spokesman confirmed the issue was on their agenda: ""What is important is that our nation wants it.""
While many Turks will be keen for Erdogan to continue as president, he is trailing in the opinion polls behind the opposition mayor of Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu, who was arrested in March and remains in jail.
Imamoglu's arrest on alleged corruption charges, which he denies, has been widely seen by his supporters as politically motivated and has sparked some of the biggest protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade.
Polls suggest that support for the mayor has risen since he was detained in prison in Silivri, west of Istanbul. 
Authorities have succeeded in blocking his social media feed on X inside Turkey and they have continued to target his city administration, detaining at least 18 staff on suspicion of corruption in recent days, including the municipality's public relations chief Taner Cetin.

Although Imamoglu's detention in jail has been widely criticised internationally, President Erdogan has largely escaped censure, with Western allies viewing him as a key Nato ally.
In his comments to reporters on Wednesday, Erdogan said Turkey's constitution did not reflect the views of civilians as it was mainly written in the wake of a 1980 military coup, even though it has been amended.
""In such a rapidly changing world, is it possible to get anywhere with a constitution that was written under the conditions of a coup?"" he asked.
The current constitution only allows two five-year presidential terms. Erdogan is already on his third, but he argued his initial term took place before Turkey moved from parliamentary rule to presidential rule.
That change required a constitutional referendum in 2017 that gave Erdogan sweeping powers, but still only allows two presidential terms.
To obtain another referendum he needs the backing of 360 MPs in the 600-seat parliament, but can currently only rely on 321. With 400 votes he could change the constitution immediately.
His recent move to bring an end to more than four decades of conflict with the Kurdish militant PKK has been interpreted by some as a bid to attract Kurdish support for a new constitution.
Erdogan said on Wednesday that by laying down its arms the PKK would enable the pro-Kurdish DEM party to continue in politics ""in a much stronger way"".
The DEM party has 56 MPs and, with their backing, Erdogan would have a far greater chance in parliament to change the constitution.
The deputy chairman of Ekrem Imamoglu's opposition CHP party, Ali Mahir Basarir, said Erdogan had no chance of running again because of a constitution that he had designed himself. Erdogan could also call early elections, but he wasn't allowing those either, Basarir said."

The P39-1 is an anonymous stretch of thinly tarred highway connecting the small towns of Newcastle and Normandien in South Africa, a four-hour drive from Johannesburg.
This week the single carriageway road, which runs mainly along the edge of farms nestled in the remote hills of the country's KwaZulu-Natal province, has found itself unexpectedly the subject of global attention.
On Wednesday many South Africans were among those watching live around the world as US President Donald Trump ambushed his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa with a video making the case that white people were being persecuted. He had previously said that a ""genocide"" was taking place.
The most striking scene in the video was an aerial shot of thousands of white crosses by the side of the road - a ""burial site"" President Trump repeatedly said, of more than a thousand Afrikaners murdered in recent years.
The president did not mention where the road was although the film was quickly linked to Normandien.
WATCH: 'Turn the lights down' - Trump confronts Ramaphosa with video
FACT-CHECK: Trump's Oval Office confrontation with Ramaphosa
US ANALYSIS: Ramaphosa keeps cool in Trump's choreographed onslaught
SOUTH AFRICAN VIEW: How Trump-Ramaphosa confrontation went down
But the people who live nearby know better than anyone that his claim is not true.
The BBC visited the area on Thursday, the day after the Oval Office showdown, to find that the P39-1's crosses have long since disappeared.
There is no burial site, and the road looks like any other. A new grain mill has been built along one stretch where the crosses once briefly stood.
What we found was a community shocked to find itself under the spotlight, and a truth about the crosses that reveals much about the delicate balance of race relations in South Africa.
Roland Collyer is a man who understands both.
A farmer from South Africa's Afrikaner community, it was the murder of his aunt and uncle Glen and Vida Rafferty, bludgeoned to death in their home five years ago, which led to the erection of the crosses.
Their deaths at their farm, by attackers who stole valuables from their home, led to a public outcry by the farming community, and the temporary planting of the crosses by fellow Afrikaners keen to highlight their murders among those of other farmers who have been killed across South Africa.
""So the video that you guys have been seeing,"" he tells me as we stand together by the roadside, ""happened along this section of the road.""
Pointing down the hill, towards a village where many black families live in mud huts, he explains: ""There were crosses planted on both sides of the road, representing lives that have been taken on farms, farm murders. All the way from the bridge down below, up to where we're standing at the moment.
""The crosses were symbolic, to what was happening in the country.""
Cyril Ramaphosa was the first African leader to be welcomed to the White House since the start of Donald Trump's second term  
One of the Raffertys' neighbours, businessman Rob Hoatson, told the BBC how he organised the crosses to capture public attention, such was the shock over the couple's deaths.
""It's not a burial site,"" he explained, saying Trump was prone to ""exaggeration"", adding though that he did not mind the image of the crosses being used. ""It was a memorial. It was not a permanent memorial that was erected. It was a temporary memorial.""
Mr Collyer continues to farm in the area but says the Raffertys' two sons left after their parents' murders. The younger, he explains, has moved to Australia while the elder has sold up and left farming to relocate to the city.
Many people remain scared for their future in South Africa, which has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
In 2022, two local men Doctor Fikane Ngwenya and Sibongiseni Madondo were convicted for the murders of the Raffertys, as well as robbery, and sentenced to life and 21 years imprisonment respectively.
For many in the local community it was a rare act of justice, with thousands of murders remaining unsolved across a country which President Ramaphosa told President Trump has yet to get a grip of its soaring crime rate.
The Raffertys' murders sparked a period of heightened racial tension in the area.
South Africa's police minister was forced to visit to try to bring calm, with protests from Afrikaners mirrored by claims from some members of the local black community of mistreatment by white farmers.
Trump referred to this clip showing rows of crosses on a rural road
Amid it all, Mr Collyer tells me that despite the misleading use of the video of his family's memorial, he is pleased that President Trump is highlighting attacks on white farmers.
""The whole procession was to raise international media coverage of the whole thing,"" he reflects. ""And for them to understand what we're actually going through and the lives that we have to live here at the moment in South Africa.
""A person has to go into a house before dark, you're living behind electric fences. That's the life we're living at the moment and you don't want to live a life like that.""
His fears would chime with many, of all races, in a country which suffered more than 26,000 murders last year. The vast majority of victims are black, according to security experts.
President Trump has made an offer of asylum for all Afrikaners, with a first group of 49 arriving in Washington earlier this month.
But Mr Collyer tells me he will stay in Normandien and has no intention of leaving South Africa.
""It's not easy just for me to leave what my father, what my grandfather, what my great-grandfather worked for, and how hard they worked, to be able to gather what I can contribute to towards today,"" he says.
""That's the difficult thing, just packing up after many generations and trying to leave the country.
""Unfortunately white Afrikaners bear the brunt of being a 'boer' (farmer) in South Africa... but at this stage I definitely would not think of going, I still love this country too much.""
And as we part ways, Mr Collyer offers a note of optimism about the future.
""I think if we can just join hands, and I think there's more than enough people in this country - black and white - who are willing to join hands and to try to make this country a success.""
There are many others in the local community for whom farming goes back generations.
Along the road, towards Normandien town, we meet Bethuel Mabaso.
The 63-year-old grew up in the area and tells us he was surprised to learn that his community had made international news - even more so that it was being cited by the US president as ""evidence"" of the targeting of white farmers.
""Nothing like that is happening here,"" he says in his native Zulu language. ""We were shocked as a community when the murders happened and sad for that family.
""I've lived here since I was a little boy and this is a peaceful area. Nothing like that has happened here since.""
In the years since the Raffertys died there have been reports of allegations from some black farm dwellers that local police had failed to attend to cases involving black people with the same urgency as they did the deaths of the couple.
I ask another local farm worker, 40-year-old Mbongiseni Shibe, what relations were like now between farmers and their mostly black staff.
""We manage whatever issues come up through discussions, if that doesn't work we ask the police to step in,"" he says.  ""It's usually incidents like our livestock going into their fields and the police help us retrieve it and vice versa.""
South Africa's violent past of racial segregation is not lost on Mr Shibe and how delicate racial matters can be here.
""We come from a difficult past in this country with white people, I remember those times of abuse even as a young boy especially on the farms here,"" he tells me.
""But we've let it go, we don't use that to punish anyone.""

Denmark is set to have the highest retirement age in Europe after its parliament adopted a law raising it to 70 by 2040.
Since 2006, Denmark has tied the official retirement age to life expectancy and has revised it every five years. It is currently 67 but will rise to 68 in 2030 and to 69 in 2035.
The retirement age at 70 will apply to all people born after 31 December 1970.
The new law passed on Thursday with 81 votes for and 21 votes against.
However, last year Social Democrat Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the sliding scale principle would eventually be renegotiated.
""We no longer believe that the retirement age should be increased automatically,"" she said, adding that in her party's eyes ""you can't just keep saying that people have to work a year longer"".
Tommas Jensen, a 47-year-old roofer, told Danish media that the change was ""unreasonable"".
""We're working and working and working, but we can't keep going,"" he said.
He added that the situation may be different for those with desk jobs but that blue-collar workers with physically demanding professions would find the changes difficult.
""I've paid my taxes all my life. There should also be time to be with children and grandchildren,"" Mr Jensen told outlet DK.
Retiring in your 60s is becoming an impossible goal. Is 75 the new 65?
Protests backed by trade unions against the retirement age increase took place in Copenhagen over the last few weeks.
Ahead of Thursday's vote, Jesper Ettrup Rasmussen, the chairman of a Danish trade union confederation, said the proposal to increase the retirement age was ""completely unfair"".
""Denmark has a healthy economy and yet the EU's highest retirement age,"" he said.
""A higher retirement age means that [people will] lose the right to a dignified senior life.""
Retirement ages around Europe vary. Many governments have raised the retirement age in recent years to reflect longer life expectancy and to tackle budget deficits.
In Sweden, the earliest age individuals can start to claim pension benefits is 63.
The standard pension age in Italy is 67, although as in the case of Denmark, this is also subject to adjustments based on life expectancy estimates and may increase in 2026.
In the UK, people born between 6 October, 1954 and 5 April, 1960 start receiving their pension at the age of 66. But for people born after this date, the state pension age will increase gradually. 
And in France, a law was passed in 2023 that raised the retirement age from 62 to 64. The highly unpopular change sparked protests and riots and had to be pushed through parliament by President Emmanuel Macron without a vote."
195,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqg705vwyno,2025-05-22 17:42:24,"US Supreme Court blocks public funding for religious charter school,","The state of Oklahoma may not direct public state funding to what was set to be the nation's first religious charter school after the US Supreme Court deadlocked over the case. 
The justices were evenly split, voting 4-4 in a ruling on Thursday. The tie affirms a lower ruling from the Oklahoma State Supreme Court, which found the effort to establish the school violates the US Constitution.
An Oklahoma school board had approved the founding of a charter school run by the Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa that would have received roughly $23.3m (Â£18.7m) in state funding over five years.
A charter school is funded by taxpayers but independently managed. 
The US Supreme Court's ruling is not considered a country-wide precedent and the justices could accept future cases related to the issue.
The court does not reveal how the justices voted, though they appeared split along ideological lines during an April hearing. 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was appointed by US President Donald Trump as one of the court's conservative justices, recused herself from the case. She did not provide a reason. 
The announcement also did not come with a formal opinion - only a single page that read: ""The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court.""
Court watchers viewed the case as a test of the US Constitution's religious boundaries.
The 1st Amendment prohibits the government from taking any action to establish a dominant religion. Taxpayer funds, such as those earmarked for public schools, have long been considered off limits to religious institutions.
The two sides of the case presented dueling views of religious freedom.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, had sued the board to force it to rescind the school's charter. He welcomed the court's decision in a statement on Thursday. 
He had long criticised the school as illegal and said it opened the state to having to fund other kinds of religious schools. 
""The Supreme Court's decision represents a resounding victory for religious liberty and for the foundational principles that have guided our nation since its founding,"" he said. 
""This ruling ensures that Oklahoma taxpayers will not be forced to fund radical Islamic schools, while protecting the religious rights of families to choose any school they wish for their children.""
The school, however, had argued that denying it charter funding as a Christian institution amounted to discrimination on basis of religion. In a statement, officials said they were disappointed in the ruling.
""We stand committed to parental choice in education, providing equal opportunity to all who seek options when deciding what is best for their children,"" the statement read. 
""In light of this ruling, we are exploring other options for offering a virtual Catholic education to all persons in the state,"" it added. 
St Isidore of Seville Virtual Catholic Charter School aimed to provide online instruction that incorporated religious teachings for about 500 students from kindergarten through high school. 
The Oklahoma State Virtual Charter School Board's 2023 decision to approve the school's application for charter status was met with almost immediate controversy.
Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, a Republican, welcomed the approval, but Mr Drummond, the attorney general, condemned it and ultimately filed a lawsuit. 
Charter schools make up a small fraction of the US school system. They have gained prominence in recent years as rallying point for some conservatives, who advocate for expanding charter schools as a means of giving parents more control over their children's education.
Trump's pick for education secretary, Linda McMahon, has sought to reduce federal support for public schools and expand support for charter and private ones."

But on Wednesday night in Washington, they were shot dead by a man who shouted ""free Palestine"" outside the Capital Jewish Museum as they left an event billed by organisers as a discussion of the Gaza crisis that aimed to ""turn pain into purpose"".
Their deaths have shocked colleagues at the Israeli embassy, sparked international outrage and prompted Israeli leaders to blame ""rising hostility"" and antisemitism after Hamas attacked the country on 7 October, 2023.
The ambassador in Washington Yechiel Leiter, paid tribute to the pair as a ""beautiful couple"".
They were ""to be engaged"", he said. ""The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem.""
Sarah Milgrim's father Robert said his family loved Mr Lischinsky, and that the couple were due to go to Israel on Sunday to meet his family, he told the BBC's US partner CBS News. 
Mr Lischinsky, 28, worked in the embassy's political department while Ms Milgrim, 26, had been a part of the public diplomacy department for a year and a half.
He was a German-born Israeli citizen, served three years in the Israel Defence Forces and held a master's degree in government diplomacy and strategy from Reichman University. 
He described himself on LinkedIn as ""proud to call both Jerusalem and Nuremberg home"" and as a wanting to ""expand the circle of peace with our Arab neighbour"". 
Friends told the BBC that Mr Lischinsky was a Christian with great belief in Israel. 
Jenny Havemann, from Ra'anana, Israel, and said he was a ""nice, modest  calm and friendly"" man, ""a part of a Christian Zionist group, and he was very into bringing Germans and Israelis together"".
Ronen Shoval, another friend described him as ""a very devout Christian"" who had moved to Israel from Germany. Many people wanted to understand his background. He was a serious Christian believer.""
Sarah Milgrim ""loves Israel and she loved everybody that lived in the Middle East"", her father Robert said. 
She spent several summers in Israel working ""with Palestinian and Israeli groups to bring them together"", including with Tech2Peace, an advocacy group training young Palestinians and Israelis and promoting dialogue between them. 
""She had a lot of close Palestinian friends, as well as many Israeli friends,"" he said. 
Tech2Peace said Ms Milgrim was an active volunteer who ""brought people together with empathy and purpose"".
""Her dedication to building a better future was evident in everything she did,"" it said. ""Her voice and spirit will be profoundly missed.""
According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Milgrim had master's degrees in international studies from the American University and another in natural resources and sustainable development from the UN University for Peace, as well as a bachelor's in environmental studies from the University of Kansas.
The couple were killed as they left an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC
The Israeli embassy said that its ""entire staff is heartbroken and devastated"" by the couple's deaths. ""No words can express the depth of our grief and horror at this terrible loss.""
Police identified the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago. He was arrested at the scene shortly after the shooting and has since been charged with with first-degree murder, as well as murder of foreign officials and related firearm charges.
According to details in an affidavit, Rodriguez initially opened fire on the victims, then reloaded and shot again ""several more times"" at closer range.
It said that as one victim tried to crawl away, he followed behind and fired again.
The shooting has led to heightened security at Israeli diplomatic missions around the world. 
The deaths come as the war in Gaza enters is nineteenth month, following the Hamas-led assault of 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
Since then, Israel's military response has killed more than 53,000 people in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the territory's health ministry. 
Aid agencies and foreign governments, including Britain, have warned of an escalating humanitarian catastrophe, with famine looming.
Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago, is in custody and being questioned over Mr Lischinsky and Ms Milgrim's deaths."
197,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg0kgg2njo,2025-05-22 14:46:24,"US House passes Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax and spending bill,","House Republicans have passed a sweeping multi-trillion dollar tax breaks package, a narrow victory for President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson after weeks of negotiations with conservative hold-outs.
Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" passed with a vote of 215 votes to 214, with two Republicans joining Democrats to oppose it and one voting present. 
It now heads to the Senate, which will have the chance to approve or change provisions of the bill. 
The US President's allies on Capitol Hill have celebrated its passage as a victory, with Johnson saying it ""gets Americans back to winning again"". 
Long a policy priority of Trump's, the legislation extends soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during his first administration in 2017, as well as provides an influx of money for defence spending and to fund the president's mass deportations. 
It also temporarily eliminates taxes on overtime work and tips - both key promises Trump made during his successful 2024 presidential campaign. 
""What we're going to do here this morning is truly historic, and it will make all the difference in the daily lives of hard working Americans,"" Johnson said on the floor before the vote. 
Additionally, the bill makes significant spending cuts, including to the Medicaid healthcare programme for lower-income Americans as well as Snap, a food assistance programme used by more than 42 million Americans. 
These cuts were the subject of intense friction among Republicans, which was finally overcome after the President travelled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. He privately told lawmakers to put aside their objections or face consequences. 
Democrats also fiercely opposed the bill and warned that the cuts could have dire consequences for millions of lower-income Americans. 
""Children will get hurt. Women will get hurt. Older Americans who rely on Medicaid for nursing home care and for home care will get hurt,"" Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said on the House floor.
""People with disabilities who rely on Medicaid to survive will get hurt. Hospitals in your districts will close. Nursing homes will shut down,"" he added. ""And people will die.""
The next day, a statement from the White House warned that the administration would see a failure to pass the bill as the ""ultimate betrayal"". 
The legislation, however, comes with a massive price tag. It is estimated to add $5.2tn (Â£3.9tn) to US debt and increase the budget deficit by about $600bn in the next fiscal year.
Those eye-popping figures - and the prospect of ballooning interest payments on the debt - were among the reasons that financial rating agency Moody's downgraded the US credit rating last week. 
The lengthy document of over 1,000-pages was released just hours before lawmakers were asked to vote on it, meaning there could be other provisions and line items yet to be discovered. 
The Senate must also approve the bill and could make some changes in the process. If lawmakers there do, it will return to the House for another high-stakes vote with potential to go wrong. 
On Truth Social, Trump urged the Senate to send the bill to his task ""as soon as possible"".
One of the first items senators will have to tackle is a report from the Congressional Budget Office that the debt increase in the House bill would trigger a provision of a 2011 law that mandates approximately $500bn in spending cuts to Medicare, the health insurance programme for the elderly.
Trump had pledged not to touch that popular government service â and Republicans would likely face a political price if they don't tweak the rules to avoid the mandatory reductions.
Democrats are pledging to use today's vote against Republicans in next year's midterm congressional elections, highlighting other spending cuts â including to the low-income health insurance programme, government research and environmental spending â and tax reductions for the wealthy. 
Even Congressional Republicans celebrate a win, the narrowness of the Republican House majority is vulnerable to even small shifts in public sentiment. The midterms could flip control of that chamber to the Democrats and grind Trump's legislative agenda to a halt."

A top Maoist leader has been killed fighting with Indian security forces in the central state of Chhattisgarh. 
Nambala Keshava Rao, who is also known by several alias, including Basavaraju, was among 27 rebels killed on Wednesday, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah said. One police officer was also reported to have died in the fighting. 
According to Shah, it is the first time in three decades that a Maoist of Rao's seniority had been killed by government forces. 
Parts of Chhattisgarh have seen a long-running insurgency by the rebels, who say they have been neglected by governments for decades. The Indian government has vowed to end their insurgency by the end of March 2026. 
Rao, an engineer by training, was the general secretary of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) group. He was on the most wanted list of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) -  India's counter-terrorism law enforcement body. 
Vivekanand Sinha, a senior police official in Chhattisgarh, said the gunfight in which Rao and the others died, broke out in the Narayanpur district following an intelligence tip-off that senior Maoist leaders were in the area. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X that he was ""proud of our forces for this remarkable success"".
The Communist Party of India, meanwhile, has condemned the killings and called for an independent inquiry. 
Last month, the Indian government launched a massive military operation - known as Black Forest - targeting the group. 
Shah said on Wednesday that 54 rebels had been arrested so far, and 84 had surrendered in the states of Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Maharashtra, as a result. 
The operation was launched after the Maoists said they were ready for talks with the government if it halted its offensive and withdrew its troops. Chhattisgarh officials said any dialogue must be unconditional. 
The Maoists are inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. Their insurgency began in West Bengal state in the late 1960s and has since spread to more than a third of India's 600 districts.
The rebels control large areas of several states in a ""red corridor"" stretching from north-east to central India.
Major military and police offensives in recent years have pushed the rebels back to their forest strongholds and levels of violence have fallen.
But clashes between security forces and rebels are still common, killing scores of people every year.
A crackdown by security forces killed around 287 rebels last year - the vast majority in Chhattisgarh - according to government data. More than 10,000 people are believed to have died since the 1960s."

Police said that the kidnappers were part of the Frente Jaime MartÃ­nez, an off-shoot of the Farc rebel group that continued fighting after Farc agreed a 2016 peace deal.
The boy's mother described his release as ""a miracle"", adding that the weeks he had been in captivity had been ""horrible, a nightmare"".
Many dissident rebel groups such as the Frente Jaime MartÃ­nez finance themselves through extortion and kidnappings for ransom, as well as drug trafficking. 
The commander of the regional police force, Brigadier General Carlos Oviedo, said the boy's stepfather had been the real target of the kidnappers, but that they had seized the boy when they found that the stepfather was not at home.
The stepfather, a local merchant, told local media that he was not involved in any illicit business and said he did not know why he had been targeted.
It is not clear if a ransom was paid for the boy's release.
His stepfather said the boy had told the family that he had been shackled for the first four days of his captivity but was in good health. 
His mother said that her son appeared anxious and that he had bitten his fingernails down. He was taken to the local hospital for examination. 
The mayor of JamundÃ­, the town where the family lives, thanked the local community ""for not giving up"" and for holding rallies demanding the boy's release. 
Colombia's vice-president, Francia MÃ¡rquez, had also demanded that the boy be freed. ""Ife is sacred and the freedom of any human being is non-negotiable, less so when it's that of a child,"" she wrote in a statement."

Broadcaster Stephen Nolan has received an unreserved apology over a ""deluge"" of social media posts accusing him of being ""involved in sectarianism and of inciting hatred and violence in Belfast"".
A statement was read out at the High Court in Dublin on Thursday morning.
A lawyer for businessman Eddie Barrett, from Tralee in County Kerry, said his client's posts on X, formerly Twitter, had been ""completely misguided and reckless"".
The statement added: ""I appreciate that, given the subject matter, they were dangerous and could have had serious ramifications for Mr Nolan.""
Mr Barrett published the material on X between February and April 2021.
The statement continued: ""I acknowledge Mr Nolan's accomplished position as an independent journalist and regret my very personal attack on him.
""I apologise unreservedly to Mr Nolan for any hurt caused or harm done to his good name.""

A ferry company says it has launched legal action to sue a shipping company for Â£125m of losses sustained because of the ""vast subsidies"" given to its competitor. 
Brittany Ferries says grants DFDS receives to run its ferry route between Newhaven in East Sussex and Dieppe in France have affected its own routes between Portsmouth and France, costing its business Â£125m since 2013. 
Christophe Mathieu, the company's CEO, said: ""Hauliers and passengers are turning to low-cost Newhaven because of this significant market distortion."" 
A DFDS spokesperson said: ""In light of the ongoing legal proceedings DFDS will revert before the court and will not for now comment in public.""
In an action lodged with the Brest Commercial Court, Brittany Ferries says it is seeking to recover ""significant losses that come from this unfair competition"" because of the grants from Syndicat Mixte Transmanche in Normandy.
Mr Mathieu said: ""The losses suffered as a consequence of vast subsidies given to DFDS to prop-up the loss-making Newhaven-Dieppe route hurt Brittany Ferries and the regions in which we operate.
""Portsmouth is our UK-hub and we want the city and the surrounding region to benefit fully from our long-standing partnership."" 
He added: ""As well as boosting their bottom line, subsidies ease the significant cost of decarbonisation - costs that must be borne fully by every other ferry company operating on the Channel.""
The next hearing is on 6 June in Brest in France, Brittany Ferries says.
As well as the civil action, Brittany Ferries has also lodged a complaint with the EU's Directorate-General for Competition.

On Wednesday, a week after the US granted asylum to nearly 60 Afrikaners - a move that rankled South Africa - President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the White House to reset the countries' relations.
Instead, Trump surprised Ramaphosa during a live news conference with widely discredited claims of a ""white genocide"" in South Africa. 
He played a video showing an exhibit during a protest of several crosses lining a road - claiming they were burial sites for murdered white farmers.
Trump said he did not know where in South Africa it was filmed. The crosses, in fact, are not actual graves, but appear to be from a 2020 protest after a farming couple was killed in KwaZulu-Natal province. Organisers said at the time that they are an exhibit representing farmers killed over years.
Before Wednesday's White House meeting, South Africa's leader stressed that improving trade relations with the US was his priority. South African exports into the US face a 30% tariff once a pause on Trump's new import taxes ends in July.
Ramaphosa hoped to charm Trump during the meeting, bringing along two famous South African golfers and gifting him a huge book featuring his country's golf courses.
The meeting came days after the arrival of 59 white South Africans in the US, where they were granted refugee status. Ramaphosa said at the time they were ""cowards"".
Still, the Oval Office meeting began cordially, until Trump asked for the lighting to be lowered for a video presentation. The mood shifted.
Ramaphosa keeps cool during Trump's choreographed onslaught
South Africans divided on Ramaphosa's mauling by Trump
Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?
The film featured the voice of leading South African opposition figure Julius Malema singing: ""Shoot the Boer [Afrikaner], Shoot the farmer"". It then showed a field of crosses, which the US president, talking over the images, said was a burial site of white farmers. 
He handed Ramaphosa what appeared to be print-outs of stories of white people being attacked in South Africa. Trump said that he would seek an ""explanation"" from his guest on claims of white ""genocide"" in South Africa, which have been widely discredited. 
Ramaphosa responded to the opposition chants in the video, saying, ""What you saw - the speeches that were made... that is not government policy. We have a multiparty democracy in South Africa that allows people to express themselves.""
""Our government policy is completely against what he [Malema] was saying even in the parliament and they are a small minority party, which is allowed to exist according to our constitution.""
On Wednesday, Ramaphosa said that he hoped Trump would listen to the voices of South Africans on this issue. He pointed out the white members of his delegation, including golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, and South Africa's richest man, Johann Rupert.
""If there was a genocide, these three gentlemen would not be here,"" Ramaphosa said.
Trump interrupted: ""But you do allow them to take land, and then when they take the land, they kill the white farmer, and when they kill the white farmer nothing happens to them.""
""No,"" Ramaphosa responded.
The US leader seemed to be referencing that Malema and his Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, which is not part of the government, have the power to confiscate land from white farmers, which they do not.
A controversial law signed by Ramaphosa earlier this year allows the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. The South African government says no land has been seized yet under the act.
Ramaphosa did acknowledge that there was ""criminality in our country... people who do get killed through criminal activity are not only white people, the majority of them are black people"".
Referring to the crosses in the video, Trump said, ""The farmers are not black. I don't say that's good or bad, but the farmers are not black...""
South Africa does not release race-based crime figures, but the latest figures show that nearly 10,000 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, a dozen were killed in farm attacks and of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.
Speaking to reporters after the Oval Office meeting and private conversations with Trump and his team, Ramaphosa said that despite the issue of genocide claims having come up, he believed ""there is doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head"".
He said he hoped that hearing from the other members in his delegation who spoke about their own experiences in South Africa would have been helpful.
""I'd like to see this as a process"", he said, adding that he expected to meet Trump again in the future, mentioning the upcoming G20 conference in South Africa in November. 
Claims of genocide in South Africa have circulated among right-wing groups for years. In February, a South African judge dismissed the claims as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"", when ruling in an inheritance case involving a donation to white supremacist group.
As Trump pressed the issue, Ramaphosa stayed calm - and tried to work his charm by making a joke about offering a plane to the US.
He invoked the name of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, saying South Africa remained committed to racial reconciliation. 
South Africa Agriculture Minister John Steenhuisen was invited to speak about the experience of farmers
When a journalist asked what would happen if white farmers left South Africa, Ramaphosa deflected the question to his white agriculture minister, John Steenhuisen, who said that most farmers wanted to stay.
But Trump kept firing salvoes at Ramaphosa, who avoided entering into a shouting match with him - something that happened to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he met Trump in the same room in February.
After the confrontation, Malema mocked the meeting, describing it as ""a group of older men meet in Washington to gossip about me"".
""No significant amount of intelligence evidence has been produced about white genocide. We will not agree to compromise our political principles on land expropriation without compensation for political expediency,"" he posted on X.
Patrick Gaspard, former US ambassador to South Africa under then-President Barack Obama, called the meeting ""truly embarrassing"". 
""It is clear that a trap was set for the South African president. There was every intention to humiliate him, to embarrass South Africa, by extension,"" he said. 

The head of South Africa's most prominent Afrikaners interest group told the BBC on Wednesday night that ""there are real issues that need to be addressed"" when asked about the Trump/Ramaphosa meeting.
Asked whether Afriforum, a South African NGO representing Afrikaners in the country, helped make the video shown in the White House Oval Office, CEO Kallie Kriel said the group had ""used some of that video footage in some of our videos, but in terms of that specific compilation, we did not make that"".
""That video material is quite easily accessible to many people, but I think that video was very important to just get the shift to a situation that there can't be denialism, and if there is (sic) going to be solutions, then there are real issues that need to be addressed. And I think that video made the point quite strongly,"" she said.
Tensions between South Africa and the US are not new. 
Days after Trump took office for his second term in January,  Ramaphosa signed into law the controversial bill that allows South Africa's government to expropriate privately owned land in cases when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"".
The move only served to tarnish the image of Africa's biggest economy in the eyes of the Trump administration - already angered by its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.
South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was also expelled in March after accusing Trump of ""mobilising a supremacism"" and trying to ""project white victimhood as a dog whistle"".

Four people have reportedly died, with more than a dozen injured in the capital Delhi and nearby areas according to local media, after a severe hailstorm hit the city on Wednesday. 
The powerful storm uprooted trees, triggered power outages and led to massive traffic snarls due to waterlogging on the streets. 
Similar scenes were reported from India's financial capital Mumbai where pre-monsoon showers led to flooding in parts of the city. 
India's weather agency has warned that ""heavy to very heavy rainfall"" is likely over India's western coast during next 6-7 days with rains and thunderstorms, external expected in almost a dozen states over the coming days, particularly in the southern part of the country. 
On Wednesday, nearly 50 flights at Delhi airport - one of the busiest in the country - were delayed and almost a dozen flights were diverted due to heavy showers, the Hindustan Times newspaper said quoting an airport official.
Passengers onboard a flight operated by India's largest carrier Indigo to Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir, had a particularly harrowing journey after the aircraft got stuck in the hailstorm. 
A video being circulated online shows many passengers screaming for help as the plane trembled violently due to strong turbulence. 
In a statement, the airline said the flight landed safely in Srinagar, but a picture of the aircraft's nose appearing to be damaged has been circulating online. The airline has not commented on the photo. 
Meanwhile, the Delhi Metro issued an advisory on X, warning commuters of potential delays due to trees and other debris falling on the tracks. 
A strong hailstorm hit Delhi on Wednesday evening, disrupting normal life
In Mumbai, viral videos from the city's Andheri area, an affluent neighbourhood, showed plastic bags and other waste floating on the streets after the rains clogged up the sewers.
Many social media users criticised authorities for poor waste management and the city's failing drainage system.
Earlier this week, incessant rains brought Bengaluru, also known as India's Silicon Valley, to a halt. At least four people were killed in rain-related incidents. 
Videos from the city showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars stranded on waterlogged streets. In some parts of the city, water had also entered the homes of people. 
India receives 80% of its annual rainfall during the monsoon season, which usually starts from June and continues until September. The monsoon is crucial for the livelihoods of many Indians, especially the country's farmers who rely on seasonal showers in the absence of irrigation in many parts of the country.  
But experts say climate change has made erratic weather, including unseasonal rains, flash floods and droughts linked to extreme heat a more regular phenomenon, upending the lives of millions.

Two staff members from the Israeli embassy were shot dead outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC on Wednesday night by a gunman who shouted ""free Palestine"" during his arrest.
Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim were a couple, who the embassy said were in the ""prime of their lives"". Mr Lischinsky was reportedly about to propose to Miss Milgrim.
The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 30, is now in custody and the FBI is investigating whether the attack was linked to terrorism or a hate crime.
Israel's foreign minister said the shooting was a direct result of ""toxic antisemetic incitement"" since the 7 October 2023 attack that prompted Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

What we know about Israeli embassy staff shooting
The couple were leaving a networking event at the Capital Jewish Museum, organised by the American Jewish Committee, at about 21:08 (local time) when a man opened fire with a handgun at a group of four people. 
The suspect then went inside the museum. Witnesses said that they initially thought the man was distressed and gave him water. 
""We heard gunshots and then a guy came in... we thought he needed help,"" eyewitness Katie Kalisher told the BBC, referring to the suspect before they realised he was the alleged shooter. 
Footage then captures the suspect shouting ""free, free Palestine"" while being detained by police. 
Metropolitan Police Department chief Pamela Smith said officers ""have not had any prior interactions"" with the suspect, who is from Chicago, and did not see anything in his background ""that would have placed him on our radar"". 
Analysis by BBC Verify suggests Elias Rodriguez has been working at the American Osteopathic Information Association since 2024.
The Israeli Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, told reporters that Mr Lischinsky had just bought an engagement ring and was planning to propose to Miss Milgrim next week in Jerusalem.
""They were a beautiful couple.""
The shooting happened in a downtown area of Washington DC that has numerous tourist sites, museums and government buildings
Both US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have condemned the attack. 
Writing on Truth Social, Trump said: ""These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA.""
Netanyahu has spoken with the parents of both victims, according to a statement from his office.
He has promised increased security at Israeli embassies around the world following the attack. 
""My heart aches for the families of the beloved young man and woman, whose lives were cut short by a heinous antisemitic murderer,"" he said. 
""We are witnessing the terrible price of antisemitism and wild incitement against the state of Israel.""
The sentiment was echoed by his Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar who accused European countries of ""incitement"". 
""This incitement is also done by leaders and officials of many countries and international organisations, especially from Europe."" 
His comments follow pressure this week from the UK, EU and France over Israel's military action and control over humanitarian aid in Gaza, where experts have warned of a looming famine. 
US Attorney General Pam Bondi and Israeli Ambassador to the US Yechiel Leiter visited the site of the shooting
The shooting, which happened in a downtown area of the city that has numerous tourist sites, museums and government buildings, triggered a major police response and shut down several main streets. 
American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement that the organization was ""devastated"" by the attack.
The event was billed as a networking opportunity to bring Jewish young professionals and the diplomatic community together. Its description said humanitarian aid organisers responding to humanitarian crises in the Middle East, including Gaza, were invited.
The Capital Jewish Museum, like many other Jewish institutions in the US, has struggled with security issues amid rising antisemitism.
""Jewish institutions all around town, all around the country, are concerned about security due to some very scary incidents that some institutions have faced and because of a climate of antisemitism,"" executive director Beatrice Gurwitz told NBC News, external in a separate news report before the attack on Wednesday.

South Koreans are celebrating Tottenham captain Son Heung-min after he led the Spurs to its first trophy in 17 years.
Many said they felt a deep sense of pride when they saw Korea's flag draped around the 32-year-old, shortly after Tottenham won the Europa League championship in Spain on Wednesday, with one online user saying they ""almost burst into tears"" and another calling him a ""national treasure"".
Son has said the win made him feel like a ""legend"" and the ""happiest man in the world"".
It was also the first piece of silverware of Son's senior career. He has never won anything in Germany with Hamburg or Bayer Leverkusen, nor with South Korea's international team.
""The scene of you holding the trophy while wearing the Taegeukgi (flag) was deeply moving,"" read one comment on Naver News, South Korea's largest news aggregate website.
""It was obviously a team effort abut I'm so proud of him achieving these results. He worked so hard for it,"" said another comment. 
Son thanked South Korean fans who stayed up late to watch the game live from Spain, which is behind South Korea by seven hours.
He apologised for ""taking so long"" to finally win a trophy.
""I hope those who don't like me will come to like me more because of this trophy,"" he told South Korean television.
Son recently filed a criminal complaint with the South Korean police against a woman who claimed she was pregnant with his child and allegedly tried to blackmail him.
Many referenced the fact that he had managed to set his personal drama aside on the field, saying he ""didn't let it affect him"". 
Son's win comes as South Korea is weeks away from a snap election to replace its former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached for declaring martial law in December. That plunged the country deep in political uncertainty.
The country also recently saw unprecedented wildfires destroy ancient temples and kill over two dozen people.

They are much loved in the UK, but Aardman characters Wallace & Gromit now also have a huge following on the other side of the world.
Gromit, in particular, has become a huge phenomenon in South Korea.
Because Wallace's sidekick and faithful helper is able to communicate through his facial expressions, Gromit has become a useful tool in schools to teach English to children.
And he's also a merchandise moneymaker - pens, keyrings and soft toys of him can be found in the capital Seoul and other large cities in the country.
Students Sunwoo Chung (L) and Sangweon Han have grown up with Wallace and Gromit in South Korea 
Susan Bolsover, Aardman's Senior Licence Manager, said about 20 to 25% of the commercial revenue from Wallace & Gromit currently comes from South Korea.
She said the Bristol-based company ""loves"" that the pair have travelled across the world.
""I think that's one of the great things about Wallace and Gromit - because Gromit communicates everything through his face, he travels around the world because there's no language barrier,"" Ms Bolsover said.
""They're [Wallace and Gromit] very loyal to each other and I think that's something they really love and embrace about them as well.""
South Korean student Sunwoo Chung, who is studying in Bristol, first encountered the Aardman characters in primary school.
She told the BBC's Andy Howard that she couldn't believe it when she saw a statue of Gromit on her first visit to Bristol.
She said: ""In elementary school we started learning English from year three.
""Because we were young, the teacher had to use some animation and one of those materials was clay animation -  Shaun the Sheep, Chicken Run or Wallace and Gromit for sure."" 
Gromit has gained particular popularity in South Korea 
The student said people in South Korea ""love dogs"" and thinks that was a trigger for the Gromit craze.
She said: ""I think because we also have animation - there's a dinosaur that doesn't talk - so I think we were all quite familiar with non-talking characters.
""But who would have known it came from here! The first time I came here, it [Gromit statue] was around the BRI [Bristol Royal Infirmary] and I was like - why is this thing here? 
""It's embedded in our childhood memory,"" she added. ""Korea loves Wallace and Gromit.""
The human-dog partnership has featured in several Aardman films
Lewis Hooper, a Bristolian now living in South Korea, said he was ""quite surprised"" to see Wallace & Gromit figures in some many shops when he arrived five years ago.
He said: ""You have Gromit pretending to be a pilot, with the goggles, and a few different outfits to cater or upsell more of the key chains. 
""I think a lot of products have been tailored to the Korean market to upsell and gain interest that way.

Chronic shortages of water in Gaza are worsening as Israel's expanding military offensive causes new waves of displacement - and desalination and hygiene plants are running out of fuel.
The UN's humanitarian office has said its partners are warning that, without immediate fuel deliveries, a full shutdown of water and sanitation facilities is possible by the end of the week.
Days after Israel imposed its blockade on aid in early March - which is only now being eased - it also cut off power lines to the main desalination plants - a vital source of water for Gazans.  
It said these steps were to put pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding.
Donkey carts have continued to distribute water in recent days
Although Israel has said it will now permit the entry of basic supplies into Gaza, so far this has not included fuel. However, some drinking water was loaded on the dozens of UN lorries that have entered the strip - with supplies not yet distributed.
Parents have told the BBC that during 19 months of war, their children have grown used to drinking salty water - with doctors saying they have seen a rise in serious kidney complaints as a result.
""Often the water turns out to be half sweet [fresh], half salty,"" said Raed al-Zaharneh, a father-of-four in Khan Younis who, like most Gazans, now relies on water delivered on lorries.
""We know it is undrinkable water, and we still drink it,"" he went on. ""We've had stomach pain and diarrhoea, but we put up with it. What do we do? We need to drink. There's no alternative.""
Jonathan Crickx of Unicef said production had reduced by 80% at a desalination plant in southern Gaza
Earlier this month, there was still a loud whirring sound at a desalination plant in southern Gaza as Jonathan Crickx of Unicef visited.
He said that production at the site had been reduced by 80% after electricity was recently cut off. However, it was still producing thousands of litres per day.
""The problem is that to produce water we now need fuel,"" Mr Crickx said. ""And afterwards we need to truck the water to the different communities.""
""This is a difficult process as we have less and less fuel, not only to produce the water but to run the trucks.""
While some lorries as well as donkey carts have continued to distribute water in recent days, the ramping up of Israel's military offensive and new waves of displacement - affecting some 140,000 people in the north and south of the strip - have made this even more challenging.
The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) says that water and sanitation services have already been severely disrupted by ongoing fuel shortages.
In northern Gaza, no fuel is currently available and only half the needed supply was received last week, Ocha says. This has meant the operating hours for water wells have been further reduced with complete shutdowns expected.
In southern Gaza, Ocha says that UN water utilities have not received any fuel, although 140,000 litres of fuel per week are needed to keep them going. This has led to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities reducing their operating hours by more than one fifth.
Gazans say they have no choice but to drink salty water when only that is available
UN workers have said they try daily to retrieve fuel from reserves in areas where they are required to co-ordinate with the Israeli authorities, such as Rafah - which has been a main focus of military operations. However, these continue to be denied.
No new fuel has been allowed into Gaza since Israel imposed its full blockade on 2 March.
A kidney specialist at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, Dr Ghazi al-Yazji, told the BBC he was seeing more patients with new infections and conditions caused by contaminated water and drinking water with high salinity.  
""We don't have precise figures, but the cases are noticeably higher among children,"" he said.
Even before the war, shortages of water and the poor quality of supplies in Gaza contributed to relatively high numbers of patients with serious kidney complaints.
Dr al-Yazji says his department has 220 patients requiring kidney dialysis and that they have been disproportionately affected by the worsening water problems. Several, he said, had recently died."

North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has condemned a ""serious accident"" during the launch of a new warship on Thursday, calling it a ""criminal act"" that could not be tolerated.
Parts of the 5,000-ton destroyer's bottom were crushed, tipping the vessel off balance, state media reported.
Kim, who was present at the launch, has ordered the ship be restored before a key party meeting in June, and for those involved in designing the ship to be held responsible for the incident which he said ""severely damaged the dignity and pride of our nation in an instant.""
State media reports did not mention any casualties or injuries as a result of the incident.
Kim attributed Thursday's accident, which took place at a shipyard in the eastern port city of Chongjin, to ""absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism"".
He added that the ""irresponsible errors"" of those involved will be dealt with at a plenary meeting next month. 
It's not clear what punishment they might face but the authoritarian state has a woeful human rights record. 
People can be jailed for almost anything, activists have said, from watching a South Korean DVD to trying to defect.
It is uncommon for North Korea to publicly disclose local accidents - though it has done this a handful of times in the past. 
Last November, it described the mid-air explosion of a military satellite six months earlier as a ""gravest failure"" and criticised officials who ""irresponsibly conducted preparations"" for it. 
In August 2023, the state blamed another botched satellite launch on an error in the emergency basting system, but said it was ""not a big issue"". 
Thursday's incident comes weeks after North Korea unveiled a new 5,000-ton destroyer on the country's west coast which it said is equipped to carry over 70 missiles. 
Kim had called the warship a ""breakthrough"" in modernising the country's naval forces and said it would be deployed early next year."

As television cameras rolled, and after some well-tempered discussion, Trump was asked by a journalist about what it would take for him to be convinced that discredited claims of ""white genocide"" in South Africa are untrue.
Ramaphosa responded first, by saying the president would have to ""listen to the voices of South Africans"" on the issue. Trump then came in, asking an assistant to ""turn the lights down"" and put the television on, so he could show the South African leader ""a couple of things"". 
Elon Musk, his adviser and a South Africa-born billionaire, watched quietly from behind a couch.

ANALYSIS: Ramaphosa survives mauling by Trump over 'white genocide'
WHAT HAPPENED: Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted'
What followed was an extraordinary and highly choreographed onslaught of accusations from the US president about the alleged persecution of white South Africans, echoing the aggressive treatment of Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky during his February visit to the White House.
The footage on the large screen showcased South African political firebrands chanting ""Shoot the Boer"", an anti-apartheid song. And Trump, so often critical of the news media, seemed happy to parade pictures of uncertain provenance. Asked where alleged grave sites of white farmers were, he simply answered, ""South Africa"".
The US leader also seemed to believe the political leaders in the footage - who are not part of the government - had the power to confiscate land from white farmers. They do not.
While Ramaphosa did sign a controversial bill allowing land seizures without compensation earlier this year, the law has not been implemented. And the South African distanced himself publicly from the language in the political speeches shown.
But the top ally of South Africa's Nelson Mandela and negotiator who helped bring an end to the apartheid regime of white-minority rule came to this meeting prepared.
Trump sometimes appears unaware of transparent efforts made by foreign leaders to flatter and that was clearly part of the South African strategy.
True, Donald Trump is a golf fanatic, but Ramaphosa's gambit of bringing two top golfers - Ernie Els and Retief Goosen - to a meeting about diplomatic problems and trade policy is not taken from any textbook on international relations I've ever read.
However, the US president's pleasure at having the two white South African golfers there was on show for all to see.
Their prognostications on the fate of white farmers got nearly as much screen time as South Africa's democratically elected president, who largely restricted himself to quiet, short interventions.
But Ramaphosa will likely be happy with that. The golfers, along with his white agriculture minister, himself from an opposition party which is part of the national unity government, were there, at least in part,  as a shield - a kind of diplomatic golden dome if you will, and it worked.
Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?
White South Africans going to US are cowards, Ramaphosa says
Trump returned repeatedly to the issue of the plight of the farmers â dozens of whom he has welcomed into the US as refugees. But President Ramaphosa wasn't biting and the provocations were largely left to blow in the breeze.
At one point, he referred to the golfers and an Afrikaner billionaire who had joined his delegation, telling Trump: ""If there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you, these three gentleman would not be here.""
But even though President Trump didn't manage to get a rise out of the South African president, that does not mean his efforts over more than an hour were in vain; they certainly were not.
This performative style of diplomacy is aimed as much at the domestic American audience as it is at the latest visitor to the Oval Office.
Central to the Make America Great Again (MAGA) project is keeping up the energy around perceived grievances and resentment and President Trump knows what his supporters want.
If some foreign leaders are learning to navigate these moments with skill, Donald Trump may have to change the playbook a bit to continue to have the impact he wants."
212,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9yyd2epk2o,2025-05-22 00:12:31,"How Trump-Ramaphosa confrontation went down in South Africa,","Donald Trump has proved to be the political Rottweiler of right-wing Afrikaner groups, taking their fight to South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa.
They were quick to celebrate the US president's ambush of Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, with the Solidarity Movement - which had toured the US to lobby the Trump administration - saying it welcomed the fact that South Africa's ""enormous problems have been placed on the international stage"".
Ernst Roets, a leading personality on the Afrikaner right, showed his admiration for the US president. 
""Donald Trump made history today,"" he said in a post on X, before thanking him for showing videos of firebrand opposition politician Julius Malema singing ""Shoot the Boer (Afrikaner); Shoot the farmer"" - and what appeared to be print-outs of stories of white people being attacked. 
Solidarity's Jaco Kleynhans went further, saying Trump deserved a Nobel Prize for ""putting the farm murder crisis on the international agenda"".
But for leading Afrikaner political columnist Pieter du Toit , externalthe ambush showed that ""months and years of exaggeration, hyperbole and misinformation fed into the American right-wing ecosystem by a range of South African activists had hit its mark"".
WATCH: 'Turn the lights down' - Trump confronts Ramaphosa with video
US ANALYSIS: Ramaphosa keeps cool in Trump's choreographed onslaught
WHAT HAPPENED: Trump ambushes S African leader with claim of Afrikaners being 'persecuted'
Cyril Ramaphosa remained calm and brought in his delegation to counter Trump's claims of white persecution
Like many South Africans he praised Ramaphosa for his measured handling of the encounter in the White House, smiling when Trump was frowning.
But many people are angry with the right-wing groups, saying they have shown a lack of patriotism by lobbying the Trump administration to take a tough line against the country.
Such critics point to the fact that South Africa has a government of national unity - made up of 10 parties from across the racial and ideological divide to tackle the nation's myriad problems - from the high crime levels that affect all races and classes, to an unemployment rate of 32%, with black people struggling the most to find jobs.
For many South Africans, the ""rainbow nation"" was on display at the White House.
The government delegation included South Africa's most senior white politician, John Steenhuisen - the agriculture minister who leads South Africa's second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance (DA).
He acknowledged South Africa had a ""real safety problem"", adding that it required ""a lot of effort to get on top of it"".
""It is going to require more policing resources,"" he said.
But he dismissed the view that most white farmers were fleeing: ""Certainly, the majority of South Africa's commercial and smallholder farmers really do want to stay in South Africa and make it work.""
Trump's video amplified the role of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party in South African politics by showing its leader singing the ""Shoot the Boer"" song.
The party advocates the nationalisation of land, and Julius Malema revels in chanting the song at his political rallies - with Trump demanding to know why no action had been taken against him. 
The song was once an anti-apartheid anthem, and Afrikaner lobby groups have tried to get it banned. But South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that a ""reasonably well-informed person"" would understand that when ""protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence"".
Instead, the song was a ""provocative way"" of advancing the EFF's political agenda - which was to end ""land and economic injustice"".
Trade unionist Zingiswa Losi (L) agreed with other South Africans in the Oval Office that crime, not race, was the problem
Ramaphosa pointed out to Trump that South Africa was a democracy - and while the government was ""completely against"" what Malema says, the EFF had a right to exist under the constitution.
The EFF fell to fourth spot in last year's parliamentary election, with Ramaphosa refusing to give Malema political oxygen by making a deal with him to form a coalition government after the poll failed to produce an outright winner. 
Steenhuisen told Trump that the DA, a centre-right party which stands for a free market economy, joined the government to keep the EFF out, and to help tackle South Africa's problems. 
""This government, working together, needs the support of our allies around the world so that we can strengthen our hand, grow our economy and shut the door forever on that rebel [Malema] getting through the doors of Union Buildings [the seat of government],"" he said. 
Steenhuisen and Ramaphosa hold the middle-ground in South African politics - the Afrikaner right-wing and the EFF, along with ex-President Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation) party, are at the extremes.
Ramaphosa promised to champion unity, invoking the name of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela - the symbol of racial reconciliation in South Africa after the end of white-minority rule in 1994. 
But some Afrikaners feel they can no longer live in South Africa, and Trump has offered them refugee status. Nearly 60 of them have been resettled in the US. 
Trump has given a boost to the right-wing, with some of them gathering outside the US embassy in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, in February with placards that read: ""Make South Africa Great Again"" - an adaptation of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"". 
South Africa's Land Reform Minister Mzwanele Nyhontso acknowledged that the meeting in the Oval Office was ""uncomfortable to watch"".
""There is no genocide in South Africa... There is crime in South Africa like in other countries and this crime affects many people, "" he told the BBC's Newshour programme.
Nyhontso applauded Ramaphosa for keeping his composure, rather than firing back at Trump when he ambushed him, with guns blazing. 
South African billionaire Johann Rupert told Trump those living in Cape Town's townships face some of the worst levels of violence from notorious gangs
Some also commended the South African president for his tactics - bringing along famous Afrikaner golfers to the meeting to defuse tensions.
When invited to talk, Ernie Els took out his South African passport to prove his patriotism - and spoke of his respect for Mandela after he managed to unite the country at the end of apartheid - but said he wanted to see South Africa flourish with America's help.
Retief Goosen perhaps added more fuel to the fire, speaking of how difficult it was for his brother to farm outside the northern town of Polokwane - explaining how he faced a ""constant battle"" with people trying to ""burn the farm down and to chase you away"".
Though he ended by saying that despite their fear of crime, ""the guys live a great life, despite what's going on"".
Billionaire businessman Johann Rupert, also an Afrikaner, pointed out that the highest murder rate in South Africa was in the townships of Cape Town, where most residents are black or coloured - as mixed-race people are known in South Africa - and are at the mercy of violent gangs.
While Zingiswa Losi, president of South Africa's largest trade union, told Trump about the devastating situation in rural areas ""where the black majority are"".
""You will see women, elderly, being raped, being killed, being murdered,"" she said. 
She urged the delegations to address the problem through trade - and creating employment.
""The problem in South Africa, it is not necessarily about race, but it is about crime.""
It is a sentiment with which most South Africans would agree.

US President Donald Trump unveiled the plan for the new missile defence system on Tuesday, announcing an initial total cost of $25bn (Â£18.7bn). He said Canada was interested in joining the project.
There are doubts from experts on how the US would deliver a comprehensive system and it is unclear how Canada would participate or how much it would pay.  
""It's something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level,"" Carney told reporters on Wednesday. 
Carney was asked by a reporter following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday whether Canada would join the military project, and how much it would spend. 
""I'm not going to put a price tag,"" on it at this stage, Carney began. 
""We are conscious that we have an ability, if we so choose, to complete the Golden Dome with investments and partnership,"" he said.
""But I'm not sure one negotiates on this. These are these are military decisions. And we will evaluate it accordingly.""
Canada's openness to joining the proposed Golden Dome system comes amid ongoing trade and security negotiations between the two countries, after Trump threatened steep tariffs on Canada and said it would be better off as a US state.
This galvanised a wave of national patriotism in Canada that was credited with ushering in a historic election win for Carney's Liberal government.
A spokeswoman for Carney confirmed earlier that talks were due to take place on the issue.
""Canadians gave the prime minister a strong mandate to negotiate a comprehensive new security and economic relationship with the United States,"" said Audrey Champoux.
""To that end, the prime minister and his ministers are having wide-ranging and constructive discussions with their American counterparts,"" she said. 
""These discussions naturally include strengthening Norad [North American Aerospace Defense Command] and related initiatives such as the Golden Dome.""
On Tuesday, Trump said that Canada has expressed interest in being part of the Golden Dome.
""We'll be talking to them,"" the US president said. ""They want to have protection also, so as usual, we help Canada.""
Trump said that the new Golden Dome defence missile programme would be operational by the end of his time in office, and that it would cost $175bn. He added that he his administration is looking for Canada to ""pay their fair share.""
But the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the eventual price tag could be $542bn over 20 years, on the space-based parts of the system alone.
Canada and the US already partner on Norad - a system that is responsible for aerospace and maritime surveillance, warning and defence of the region, and that can detect and shoot down cruise missiles.
Norad has been in place since 1958, and both countries in recent years have been engaged in discussions to modernise it.
Trump said the proposed Golden Dome is meant to target increasingly sophisticated aerial weapons, including hypersonic missiles, and will include space-based sensors and interceptors.
He said the system would be ""capable even of intercepting missiles launched from the other side of the world, or launched from space"".
It is partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011.
Experts have expressed doubts on whether the US would be able to build a similarly comprehensive defence system, given its larger land mass. 
Shashank Joshi, defence editor at the Economist, told the BBC that one way the Golden Dome could work was by using thousands of satellites to spot and track missiles and then use interceptors in orbit to fire at the missiles as they take off and take them out.
He said the US military would take the plan seriously but it was unrealistic to think it would be completed during Trump's term, and the huge cost would suck up a large chunk of the US defence budget."

It is 10 years since people in the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly to legalise same-sex marriage in an historic referendum.
On 22 May 2015, more than 62% voted in favour of amending the country's constitution to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry.
It was the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage through a popular vote.
Some 5,956 same-sex marriages have taken place since. BBC News NI has been speaking to some couples who tied the knot.
Out of 43 constituencies, only the largely rural Roscommon-South Leitrim had a majority of ""no"" votes
Steven Smyrl and Roy Stanley have been together for more than 20 years, and they entered a civil partnership in 2011.
Steven said the couple recognised that step ""would bring full equality, and it did"".
""It paved the way for the enormity of the 'yes' vote,"" he said.
Roy said that when they entered their civil partnership, it allowed family members to attend - some of whom died before they would marry seven years later.
The vote on same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland was held 22 years after homosexual acts were decriminalised in the country.
It meant a marriage between two people of the same sex would have the same status under the Irish constitution as a marriage between a man and a woman.
Civil partnerships for same-sex couples had been legal in Ireland since 2010 - and this was the route many same-sex couples went down at first.
Celebrations in Dublin were like ""Ireland had won the World Cup"" for some people
Michael Conlon, from Belfast, lived in the Republic of Ireland at the time of the referendum and was in a civil partnership with his now husband, Ger.
""I had always assumed civil partnership was pretty much it. You got all the rights as marriage and it turns out, in the south, that wasn't the case,"" he said.
Michael  campaigned for a 'yes' vote in the build-up to the referendum.
He said the ensuing celebrations were like ""Ireland had won the world cup"".
""I suppose it was almost as if something so monumental had happened. It was like the country had won something.
""It was an experience I could not really put into words,"" he added.
At the time of the referendum, Ireland became the 20th country to legalise same-sex marriage; now there are 38 countries.
In total, 1,201,607 people voted in favour of same-sex marriage, while 734,300 voted against.
Out of 43 constituencies, only the largely rural Roscommon-South Leitrim had a majority of ""no"" votes.
For Roy and Steven, the referendum result was never in doubt.
""I think it was a surprise to everybody, including those that voted yes and and those that voted no, just the the size of the the majority in favour,"" said Steven.
Journalist Una Mullally told BBC News NI that the campaign for the referendum was the ""culmination of many years of organising and protesting and activism"".
""At times it felt like a pipe dream. The early protests were very small. It certainly wasn't on the political agenda. 
""There was a lot of education and awareness and visibility and representation work to be done on the public agenda. So it was a long movement.""
Una said the results made her feel ""utter relief and happiness. I mean it was complete joy.""
She added that it is a day she will ""never forget.""
Crediting the work people had put into it, she said: ""All of the canvassing, all of the volunteering, all of the campaigning, it was just like this huge wave had fallen.
""I think the level of the result as well  - that it wasn't marginal -  so it was just this kind of safety and feeling that so many people were with the community.""
Una Mullally, right, and her wife Sarah Francis got married in 2023 in Las Vegas
Michael said that he and his now husband had not planned on getting married - until the involvement of a friend who was the then lord mayor of Dublin.
Their wedding happened in the Lord Mayor's official residence, The Mansion House in 2018.
""Because we'd done done the the big celebration in 2011, that [wedding] was a more select celebration. 
""But the people who attended in 2011, a lot of them said to us... they'd never been to such a joyful wedding and that's partly because it just meant so much to everybody there, because it was something denied to us for so long,"" Roy said.
Una went to Las Vegas for her wedding to Sarah Francis, adding:  ""It was hard to even conceptualise getting married in a weird way, because, I guess, it didn't exist as a right for so long.
""But for that right to be recognised in the country where I'm from, where I grew up, where I live, it is profound in a rights' context.""
Steven and Roy married in 2018
After their marriage in 2018, Steven, was removed from his position as an elder with the Presbyterian Church in Dublin, which left them both ""feeling really shaken"".
""To dismiss me as an elder, and there's plenty of people would say, well, he knew what he was doing. 
""Yeah, I knew what I was doing, simple as that. But, I love Roy with all my heart and there was absolutely no way that we were not going to be celebrating our marriage.""
He added that he saw no theological inconsistency with same-sex marriage.
""Nobody really gives a second thought about the fact that two people with the same sex might want to get married,"" said Steven.
Una, however, said that bigotry can ""find new avenues"".
""There is a strange atmosphere that we're experiencing on this island and in so many other countries when it comes to resentment and grievance around minorities in general.""
Michael and his husband have now moved back to Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage wasn't legal until 2020.
He said the perception of gay people had been ""for the most part really positive"".
""Even some of the really religious people who are fundamentally against it, they're kind of more accepting of it,"" he said.
""They see that the sky didn't fall in, that they can still go to church, they can still pray, that none of their rights were taken away."""
215,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cje778q8nl7o,2025-05-21 17:29:17,"Trump meets Republican hard-liners in hopes of moving tax bill forward,","Donald Trump talks to reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as House Speaker Mike Johnson looks on
President Donald Trump and House Republicans continued to negotiate a far-reaching tax and spending bill on Wednesday, holding discussions at the White House ahead of a potential vote.
Trump and his staff spent several hours with members of the House Freedom Caucus, who have refused to support a bill they say does not go far enough in cutting spending.
Many of Trump's top priorities are in the legislation: extending tax cuts passed in 2017, eliminating taxes on tips, spending more on defence and border security, and cutting government health care programmes.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill would add about $2.3tn (Â£1.7tn) to the US national debt over the next 10 years.
Trump campaigned on promises to reduce the US budget debt - the cumulative gap between the government's tax revenue and its spending  - which currently stands at around $36.2tn (Â£27tn).
Negotiators worked through the night on Tuesday, including a meeting of a House committee which began at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) Wednesday.
Because Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House and Democrats uniformly oppose the legislation, Trump can only risk losing a handful of votes from his own party.  He and congressional allies are also under the pressure of a self-imposed deadline to get the bill passed by the end of the month, which is now 10 days away. 
After it wins approval in the House, the bill will head to the Republican-led Senate, which could make its own changes.
After leaving the White House negotiations on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson said the full House could vote on the bill Wednesday night or Thursday morning, according to Politico.
The president has called his proposal a ""big, beautiful, bill"" â the measure is now officially known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" â but has faced opposition from members of the House Freedom Caucus who want additional spending cuts. 
At the same time, several Republicans representing districts in Democratic-leaning states want bigger tax cuts for their voters - to be achieved by increasing credits those voters receive for paying state taxes at relatively high rates.
Trump and Johnson are trying win over both dissenting factions, which could prove to be a delicate balance.
Kentucky's Thomas Massie, one of the Republican holdouts in the House, took to X to complain about the closed negotiations. Trump earlier this week labelled him a ""grandstander"".
""Major provisions of the big beautiful bill are still being negotiated and written, yet we are being told we will vote on it today,"" Massie wrote. ""Shouldn't we take more than a few hours to read a bill this big and this consequential?""
Trump also visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to push for the bill, meeting with Republicans and urging both the budget hawks and tax-cut proponents to accept the bill on the table. 
But it was unclear if he managed to swing many votes.
Democrats, saying the bill would benefit the rich and unfairly punish lower-income Americans, have made it clear in committee hearings and on social media that they will only vote against it.
The White House has dismissed worries about the ballooning US debt, arguing that tax cuts will stimulate the economy. Trump also has said his separate programme of tariffs will bring additional revenue to the federal government.  However, most economists and experts agree with the non-partisan CBO that the bill will add to the debt.
The bill's supporters have remained bullish about its eventual prospects.
""Failure is not an option in getting this done,"" said Republican Jason Smith of Missouri.
The spending bill is now officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
A separate CBO analysis reported that the bill would hurt the poorest Americans while benefiting the top 10% of earners.
""We're going to ask Americans to finance tax cuts for billionaires on the national debt - on the credit card,"" said Democratic Representative Gwen Moore of Wisconsin.
The tight margin between the parties in the House means Trump and his allies need near-unanimous support from Republicans to pass the measure.
House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he wants the bill passed by Monday 26 May, the Memorial Day holiday in the US.
Although it is possible the bill could come up in the full House on Wednesday or Thursday, it is unlikely that the Speaker will risk a vote unless he is confident that the measure will pass.
Even if the bill passes the House, it is a long way from becoming law. The legislation would move to the Senate - and then be subjected to a likely negotiation process to reconcile two versions of the bill - before it can be sent to the president for his signature."
216,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jxn8m88ro,2025-05-16 22:09:17,"Four sticking points in Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill,","Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" has so-far stalled on Capitol Hill. 
US President Donald Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is a key part of his legislative agenda - but for the moment it has stalled in Congress. 
Republicans narrowly control both the House of Representatives and Senate, and it is discord among members of Trump's own party that has put his ""big beautiful bill"" in limbo.
Trump met with dissenting Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, and members of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus were reportedly set to visit the White House  on Wednesday.
Reports suggest, though, Trump has been unable to convince all the holdouts. 
He has said that if a Republican lawmaker opposed the bill, they ""wouldn't be a Republican much longer"". 
The bill was narrowly approved by the House budget committee on Sunday night, giving House Speaker Mike Johnson a rare win. But it had failed on the committee's first vote, with Republican hold-outs concerned about spending and national debt.
The Senate must also pass the legislation and Republicans there are working on their own tweaks.
Let's take a look at where disagreements lie.
The bill combines an extension of tax cuts passed in 2017 with other tax measures and spending cuts.
Trump and his congressional allies are trying to satisfy both budget hawks who want deeper spending cuts and Republicans who want tax reductions but worry about the effects of cutting some programmes.
That has led to one of the biggest questions: How much spending to slash?
The numbers can be daunting, especially for a party that has traditionally pushed to reduce the country's debt.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would, over the next decade, add about $2.3 trillion (Â£1.7tn) to the national debt, which is currently around $36.2tn (Â£27tn).
Cutting government health care programmes and tax incentives for green energy would save money, but the CBO and most economists believe that still wouldn't be enough to make up for revenue lost by the bill's tax cuts.  
The prospect of swelling national debt - which Trump promised to tackle during his election campaign - has prompted opposition from the House Freedom Caucus.
Moody's downgrades US credit rating citing rising debt
Five House Republicans stall Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill
Perhaps the most contentious item in the bill are cuts - partly through work requirements - to Medicaid, a healthcare programme aimed at lower-income Americans.
Chip Roy of Texas and other Republicans in the House - including South Carolina's Ralph Norman, Oklahoma's Josh Brecheen and Georgia's Andrew Clyde - are pressing for the bill to go further. 
On Sunday night, Speaker Johnson said ""minor modifications"" had been promised to the four rebels, including preventing undocumented immigrants from accessing Medicaid.
The concessions also involved Medicaid work requirements.
Under the original House bill, states would have to deny Medicaid coverage to able-bodied Americans who were not working at least 80 hours a month or undertaking other community options, starting in 2029, after Trump left office. Coverage would also be ended for those not meeting work requirements.
In the current version, the requirements would start next year.
But other Republicans, such as Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, have argued against any cuts to Medicaid, warning they would hurt millions of lower-income constituents.
Hawley wrote in the New York Times the cuts would be ""both morally wrong and politically suicidal"".
Dozens of other Republicans are also concerned.
Then, there are Republicans seeking larger tax cuts. They generally represent relatively wealthy areas in higher-tax, Democratic-dominated states such as New York. 
They want the bill to provide bigger tax credits for what people pay in state and local taxes - known as Salt.
The bipartisan ""Salt Caucus"" has been pushing raise the current $10,000 cap on such credits since it was formed in 2021. Some Republican members want it raised to $62,000 for individuals.
House Speaker Mike Johnson and the so-called Salt Republicans reached a tentative compromise late Tuesday to raise it to $40,000, according to reports.
But in a sign of how tricky negotiations have become, that news prompted dismay from budget hawks who insist that any such tax cut be balanced with correspondent spending cuts. 
Every year more than 42 million Americans use federal food aid called Snap , which stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, to buy groceries. 
Many House Republicans want to shrink the amount the government pays for ""food stamps"". The legislation would require individual states to shoulder 5% of the benefit's costs each year, as well as 75% of the administrative costs.
At the moment, states are not responsible for any Snap costs and pay 50% of administrative costs.
Republicans also hope to expand existing work requirements, which currently apply to people without dependants between the ages of 18 and 54, by raising the upper age limit to 64.
The House Agriculture Committee has already approved $300m (Â£223m) in reductions to Snap to balance out tax cuts.
Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin called the proposed changes  ""a slap in the face"" of millions of people who rely on Snap ""to put food on the table and make sure their kids don't go hungry"".
Republicans say they would reduce government waste, promote work, and restore ""common sense"" to the programme.
Government data shows about 12% of Americans received Snap benefits last year. 
That figure is greater in numerous Republican-leaning states with relatively high poverty rates, including Alabama and Oklahoma."

Earlier, a lawyer for the Justice Department confirmed the aircraft carrying the deportees had landed but did not say where, citing ""very serious operational and safety concerns"", as reported by Reuters.
The judge has said he would decide on another day whether he would hold Homeland Security officials in contempt of court.
Earlier on Wednesday, the department shared on X the photographs, nationalities and criminal convictions of eight men on board the deportation flight. 
They are listed as citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Myanmar, and Vietnam. 
Department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told a briefing earlier on Wednesday: ""Every single one of them was convicted of a heinous crime, murder, rape, child rape, rape of a mentally and physically handicapped victim."" 
She said it was ""absurd for a US judge to try to dictate the foreign policy and national security of the US"".
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons said: ""If we don't have a country that'll take their citizens back, we do have an option to find a safe third country."" 
They did not specify where the migrants might ultimately be bound.
Judge Murphy issued a ruling on 18 April requiring that illegal migrants have a ""meaningful opportunity"" to challenge their removal to countries other than their homelands.
After learning the men were on a flight leaving the country, he quickly scheduled a hearing on Tuesday where he said the migrants must remain in the government's custody and be ""treated humanely"". He did not order the plane to turn back to the US.
One of the deported men was Nyo Myint, a citizen of Myanmar. According to homeland security, he had been convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 12 years of confinement. He was arrested by immigration authorities on 19 February, and was detained in Texas.
In August 2023, an immigration court in Omaha, Nebraska, issued Myint a final order of removal, according to court documents filed by groups representing multiple deportees.
His immigration attorney, Jonathan Ryan, told the BBC that his client had received two conflicting deportation notices on 19 May. 
The first, which arrived at about 10:59 local time, notified Myint he would be sent to South Africa, but subsequent several hours later declared he would be taken to South Sudan. 
Both notices were provided in English, a language that Mr Ryan said his client barely speaks. On Tuesday, Mr Ryan said he was notified that Myint was being removed from the country.
""I have no idea where he is,"" Mr Ryan said. ""He's been disappeared by the United States government.""
Mr Ryan acknowledged his client's criminal record, but said he and the other deportees were still entitled to the same due process rights as any other individual.
""These people were purposefully selected by the government for this maneuver, to divert our attention from the government's blatant disregard for a federal judicial order,"" he said.
""If we allow the government  to pick and choose who deserves due process and who has rights, we're relinquishing all rights,"" he said.
As it accelerates and expands deportations, the Trump administration is working with other countries to accept both their citizens removed from the US, as well as citizens of other nations. Most notably, it sent migrants it said were originally from Venezuela to a mega-prison in El Salvador.
Rwanda confirmed it was in such talks with the US, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini and Moldova have all been named in media reports.
In early April, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the US was revoking visas issued to all South Sudanese passport holders because the African nation was refusing to accept its citizens who had been removed from the US."

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said he is ""shocked and horrified"" after Israeli troops fired warning shots in the vicinity of a diplomatic delegation on a visit to the occupied West Bank.
The delegation included two Irish diplomats based in Ramallah, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Harris said.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the group had ""deviated from the approved route"", warning shots were fired into the air ""to distance them away"" and it ""regrets the inconvenience caused"".
Many countries, some of which had diplomats on the visit, have condemned Israel's actions - including Spain, Egypt, France, Turkey and Italy.
No injuries were reported in the incident, which happened in the city of Jenin, where Israel has been fighting armed Palestinian groups for years.
The Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, has accused the Israeli security forces of deliberately targeting the delegation in a ""heinous crime"".
Some nations have said they will summon Israeli ambassadors to account for the incident, calling for investigations and explanations from Israel.
The IDF added it would speak to representatives of the nations involved to update them on the result of an internal investigation into the incident.
In a statement, the taoiseach said he ""unreservedly condemns this aggressive, intimidatory and violent act"".
""This is not and must never be a normal way to behave,"" he said.
""We, and the international community, will be demanding answers from Israel on exactly how this came to happen and will seek assurances that this will never happen again.""
Martin added diplomats play an ""important and vital role"" and they should never fear ""becoming targets"".
The tÃ¡naiste (deputy PM) and foreign affairs minister said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by the news.
""This is completely unacceptable and I condemn it in the strongest terms,"" Harris added.
Harris has been in touch directly with Feilim McLaughlin, the Representative of Ireland to the Palestinian National Authority, to convey his full support, Irish broadcaster RTÃ has reported.
Meanwhile, a senior official in the Department of Foreign Affairs has delivered a dÃ©marche - a protest registered through diplomatic channels - to convey the tÃ¡naiste's condemnation and concerns to Dana Erlich, Israel's non-resident ambassador to Ireland.
The taoiseach has condemned the military's action
The incident comes amid mounting pressure on the Israeli government over its military actions in Gaza.
After several days of intense bombardment, the IDF launched an expanded offensive on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would see ground forces ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. 
On Wednesday, Netanyahu told reporters ""in the end"" the Gaza Strip - in its entirety - will be under Israeli security control, and that Hamas will be defeated.
More than 600 people have been killed and 2,000 injured across Gaza over the past week, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. 
The United Nations (UN) has said tens of thousands of people have been newly displaced.
Intensified ground operations and new evacuation orders are stretching Gaza's health system beyond breaking point, the head of the World Health Organisation has warned.
Netanyahu - who is sought under an International Criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, which he has dismissed as ""antisemitic"" - has been under heavy international pressure to end the blockade of Gaza after a respected international survey warned of imminent famine.
On Wednesday, the UN said no aid has yet been distributed in Gaza despite lorries starting to cross the border after an 11-week blockade.
Earlier this week, the UK said it would be suspending trade talks over what it described as Israel's ""morally unjustifiable"" military escalation in Gaza, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing the situation as ""intolerable"".
Meanwhile, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc would be reviewing its trade agreement with Israel in light of its actions in Gaza.
Earlier on Wednesday, First Minister Michelle O'Neill urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to put the ""strongest possible political and economic sanctions on Israel"".
In a letter, she acknowledged a joint statement issued by the British, French and Canadian governments, but said there is now an ""urgent responsibility on world leaders to take serious action"", according to PA.
""We need an immediate and meaningful escalation in political and economic sanctions to pressure Israel to halt its military operations and comply with international humanitarian law,"" she added.
First Minister Michelle O'Neill has urged the UK prime minister to put the strongest possible sanctions on Israel
O'Neill said the British government has a ""legal and moral obligation"" to suspend arms sales when there is a clear risk they could be used ""to commit serious violations of international law"".
""That threshold has undeniably been crossed.""
She added Westminster must impose the sanctions on Israel while it ""continues its campaign of terror, horror and war against defenceless citizens"".
""Diplomatic condemnation must be matched with decisive action to exert maximum pressure to bring an end to the genocide in Gaza, and ensure accountability for violations of international law,"" the Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader continued.
""I urge you to show leadership, and to take strong and immediate action.
""The world is watching, and the people of Gaza cannot wait any longer.""
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry."

As Israel's war in Gaza enters a new, violent phase, a growing number of voices within the country are speaking out against it - and how it's being fought.
Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sparked outrage on Monday when he said: ""Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country.
""A sane state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the goal of depopulating the population,"" he told Israeli public radio's popular morning news programme.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, describing the comments as ""blood libel"".
But on Wednesday, a former Israeli minister of defence and IDF chief of staff - Moshe ""Bogi"" Ya'alon - went further.
""This is not a 'hobby',"" he wrote in a post on X, ""but a government policy, whose ultimate goal is to hold on to power. And it is leading us to destruction.""
Just 19 months ago, when Hamas gunmen crossed the fence into Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages - statements like these seemed almost unthinkable.
But now Gaza is in ruins, Israel has launched a new military offensive, and, though it has also agreed to lift its 11-week blockade on the territory, just a trickle of aid has so far entered.
Recent polling by Israel's Channel 12 found that 61% of Israelis want to end the war and see the hostages returned. Just 25% support expanding the fighting and occupying Gaza. 
The Israeli government insists it will destroy Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages. Netanyahu says he can achieve ""total victory"" - and he maintains a strong core of supporters.
But the mood among others in Israeli society ""is one of despair, trauma, and a lack of a sense of ability to change anything"", says former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin.
Protesters have continued demanding a ceasefire and a return of Israeli hostages 
""The overwhelming majority of all the hostage families think that the war has to end, and there has to be an agreement,"" he adds.
""A small minority think that the primary goal of finishing off Hamas is what has to be done, and then the hostages will be freed"".
On Sunday, around 500 protesters, many wearing T-shirts with the inscription ""Stop the horrors in Gaza"" and carrying pictures of babies killed by Israeli air strikes, attempted to march from the town of Sderot to the Gaza border, in protest at Israel's new offensive.
They were led by Standing Together - a small but growing anti-war group of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. After attempting to block a road, the leader of the group Alon-Lee Green was arrested, along with eight others.
From house arrest, Mr Green told the BBC: ""I think it's obvious that you can see an awakening within the Israeli public. You can see that more and more people are taking a position.""
Another Standing Together activist, Uri Weltmann, said he thinks there's a growing belief that continuing the war is ""not only harmful to the Palestinian civilian population, but also risks the lives of hostages, risks the lives of soldiers, risks the lives of all of us"".
Gaza's ""whole population is on the brink of starvation,"" according to the United Nations (UN) World Food Programme
In April, thousands of Israeli reservists - from all branches of the military - signed letters demanding that Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate instead on reaching a deal to bring back the remaining hostages.
Yet, many in Israel hold differing views.
At the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza on Wednesday, the BBC spoke to Gideon Hashavit, who was part of a group protesting against aid being allowed in.
""They're not innocent people,"" he said of those in Gaza, ""they make their choice, they chose a terrorist organisation.""
It is against some of the most extreme parts of Israeli society - settler groups - that the UK on Tuesday announced fresh sanctions.
In its strongest move yet, the UK also suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel and summoned the country's ambassador - with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy calling the military escalation in Gaza ""morally unjustifiable"".
The EU said it is reviewing its association agreement with Israel, which governs its political and economic relationship - with foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas saying a ""strong majority"" of members favoured looking again at the 25-year-old agreement.
On Monday night, the UK joined France and Canada in signing a strongly worded joint statement, condemning Israel's military action and warning of ""further concrete actions"" if the humanitarian situation in Gaza did not improve.
""The mood is changing,"" says Weltmann, ""the wind is starting to blow in the other direction."""

The US has accepted a plane intended for the Air Force One fleet from Qatar, a gift that has sparked criticism including from some of President Trump's biggest supporters.
""The secretary of defense has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar in accordance with all federal rules and regulations,"" Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement on Wednesday. 
The plane will need to be modified before it can be used as part of Air Force One  - the president's official mode of air transport.
The White House insists that the gift is legal, but the announcement of the transfer a week ago caused huge controversy.
The plane is a gift from the Qatari royal family and is estimated to be worth $400m (Â£300m). The White House says that the new plane will be transferred to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.
It could require years to fit with additional security systems and upgrades required to carry the president - including the ability to withstand the electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear blast, and to refuel mid-flight.
Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn (Â£750m).
Justifying the transfer a week ago Trump said: ""They're giving us a gift"". The president has also said it would be ""stupid"" to turn down the plane.
The US Constitution has a provision known as the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without permission of Congress. The transfer has not received congressional approval.
The president has argued that the plane transfer is legal because it is being given to the US defence department, and not to him personally. He also insisted he would not use it after leaving office.
The current Air Force One fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller 757s.

Trump has expressed his displeasure at the aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which has been contracted to provide the White House with two 747-8s directly.
His team negotiated to receive them during his first term in office, though there have been repeated delays and Boeing has cautioned that they will not be available for two or three more years.
Trump surreptitiously visited the Qatari plane in Palm Beach, near his Mar-a-Lago resort, just a few weeks after the start of his second term in office.
The president insists there is no quid-pro-quo involved and that the plane is a simple exchange between two allies.
On Truth Social he wrote: ""The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.""
Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani has said the transfer ""is a government-to-government transaction. 
""It has nothing to do with personal relationships - neither on the US side, nor the Qatari side. It's between the two defence ministries,"" he said.
But those assertions have done little to calm the criticism of the deal, including from a number of Trump's allies in Congress and the right-wing media. 
""I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety, whether it's improper or not,"" Rand Paul, Republican senator from Kentucky, told Fox News.
""I wonder if our ability to judge [Qatar's] human rights record will be clouded by the fact of this large gift,"" Paul said.
Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said accepting the gift would pose ""significant espionage and surveillance problems""."

Intensified Israeli ground operations and new evacuation orders are stretching Gaza's health system beyond breaking point, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the Indonesian, Kamal Adwan and al-Awda hospitals in the northern towns of Beit Lahia and Jabalia were inside an evacuation zone announced on Tuesday. Another two hospitals are within 1km (0.6 miles) of it.
Kamal Adwan was out of service due to hostilities nearby and the Indonesian hospital was inaccessible because of the presence of Israeli forces around it, he added.
Al-Awda hospital is still functioning, but its director told the BBC on Wednesday that it was ""totally under siege"".
""Nobody can move out and we can't receive any cases from outside the hospital,"" Dr Mohammed Salha said.
He added that there was a quadcopter drone ""shooting in the surroundings of the hospital and the outdoor area of the hospital"".
""We also hear shooting from the tanks... maybe 400 or 500 metres [away].""
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it was ""operating in the area against terror targets"", but that it was ""not aware of any siege on the hospital itself"".
Dr Tedros said: ""Even if health facilities are not attacked or forced to evacuate, hostilities and military presence obstruct patients and staff from accessing care, and WHO from resupplying hospitals, which can quickly make them non-functional.""
""We've seen this too many times - it must not be allowed to happen again.""
MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) also said that at least 20 medical facilities across Gaza had been damaged, or forced partially or completely out of service, in the past week by Israeli ground operations, air strikes and evacuation orders.
The charity demanded that Israeli authorities stop what it called the ""deliberate asphyxiation of Gaza and the annihilation of its healthcare system"".
Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining 58 hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
After several days of intense bombardment, the IDF launched an expanded offensive on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said would see ground forces ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza. The plan reportedly includes completely clearing the north of civilians and forcibly displacing them to the south.
More than 600 people have been killed and 2,000 injured across Gaza over the past week, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The UN says tens of thousands of people have been newly displaced.
Netanyahu also said Israel would allow a ""basic"" amount of food into Gaza to prevent a famine. But the UN has so far been unable to collect the dozens of lorry loads of supplies allowed in since Monday.
MSF said the volume of aid allowed in so far was not nearly enough, describing it as ""a smokescreen to pretend the siege is over"".
On Tuesday, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories said he had recently returned from Gaza and witnessed how the health system was facing attacks and acute shortages of supplies.
""Every time you get into Gaza you always think it cannot get worse. But it gets worse,"" Dr Rik Peeperkorn told reporters in Geneva.
He described how al-Awda hospital was ""overwhelmed with injuries"" and running low on supplies. Hostilities had damaged the facility, disrupted access and deterred people from seeking healthcare, he added.
He said the Indonesian hospital was barely functioning, almost inaccessible, and that most patients had left last week after a staff member was killed, one patient was injured and the facility was damaged during intensified hostilities.
Only 15 people, including patients and staff, were still inside the hospital as of Tuesday, urgently in need of food and water, he added.
The hospital's generator was also struck by an Israeli quadcopter on Monday night, causing a large fire and a blackout, according to MER-C Indonesia, the NGO that built the facility.
On Wednesday, a woman inside the hospital told the BBC by telephone that two of the patients were in a ""serious condition"".
In the background of the call, crashes could be heard.
""Five minutes ago, there was intense shooting in the surroundings of the hospital,"" she said, adding that she could see tanks.
The woman also said that they still had supplies of food inside the hospital, but were ""facing a water crisis"".
The IDF told the BBC it was operating in the area around the hospital and targeting ""terrorist infrastructure sites"", but that it was not targeting the hospital itself.
The Indonesian hospital's generators were reportedly struck on Monday night
In another incident on Tuesday, a paramedic said his ambulance was shot at by an Israeli drone while he was transporting staff and food between al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals.
Khaled Sadeh said he was with another ambulance when bullets hit both vehicles' windshields. Nobody was injured.
Dr Salha shared photos of the ambulances and confirmed that Mr Sadeh was unable to return to al-Awda because of the threat of Israeli fire.
The BBC supplied details of the allegations and photos to the IDF, but it said it ""could not confirm"" the reports.
Hospitals and medical personnel are specially protected under international humanitarian law.
Hospitals only lose that protection in certain circumstances. They include being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a weapons depot, or to hide healthy fighters.
The IDF has insisted that its forces operate in accordance with international law. In most instances where it has attacked hospitals, it has said they were being used improperly by Hamas - an allegation the group has denied.
A paramedic said his ambulance was shot at by an Israeli drone while driving between al-Awda and Kamal Adwan hospitals
In the southern city of Khan Younis, the European hospital - the only facility providing neurosurgery, cardiac care and cancer treatment in Gaza - has been out of service since 13 May.
That day, the hospital's courtyard and surrounding area was hit by a series of Israeli air strikes that Israel's defence minister said targeted an underground bunker where the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Sinwar, was hiding. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said the attack killed at least 28 people, but it is not clear yet whether Sinwar died.
The facility has also been inside an Israeli-designated evacuation zone covering almost the entire eastern half of Khan Younis since Monday.
Dr Tedros said Nasser, al-Amal and al-Aqsa hospitals, as well as one field hospital, were within 1km of the zone.
The European hospital has been out of service since a series of Israeli strikes hit its courtyard on 13 May
Dr Victoria Rose, a British surgeon working at Nasser hospital, said in a video posted on social media on Wednesday, external that she was very worried about the facility being evacuated or cut off by an Israeli troops advance from al-Aqsa, which in the central town of Deir al-Balah.
""If we get cut off from the Middle Area, there really are no other hospitals around us that could cope with the evacuation of Nasser,"" she explained.
""We have some amazing field hospitals... but none of them are capable of doing the type of surgery that we're doing here. And none of them have ICU capacity or generated oxygen. So, even all of them together couldn't cope with the amount of patients that we have.""
She warned: ""If Nasser is evacuated, we really are looking at the imminent death of hundreds of patients because we won't be able to take them anywhere.""
Critical supplies were destroyed when Nasser hospitals medical warehouse was hit and damaged on Monday
Nasser was also hit by an Israeli strike on 13 May, killing two people including a Palestinian journalist who was being treated for injuries he sustained in a previous strike on a tented camp at the complex. The attack also destroyed 18 beds in a burns unit, according to the WHO.
The IDF accused the journalist of being a Hamas operative and alleged that the hospital was being used by the group to ""carry out terrorist plots"".
Another strike on Monday severely damaged Nasser's medical warehouse and destroyed critical WHO supplies, according to the hospital's director.
Suha Shaath, a pharmacist from Khan Younis who has been told by the IDF to evacuate and head to camps in the coastal al-Mawasi area, told the BBC in a voice note: ""I have not left my house until now because I haven't found any place to set up my tent.""
""The humanitarian situation is very serious - no water, no food, no fuel. The shelling is hitting everywhere,"" she added.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

At a press conference at the annual Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan, he called the policies a ""failure"".
His comments come just days after the Trump administration said it was dropping rules blocking exports to China entirely and restricted sales to dozens of other countries.
The measures, announced in the final days of Joe Biden's presidency drew fierce pushback from tech companies, including Nvidia. 
The US started imposing controls on exports related to semiconductors during Trump's first term, citing concerns about letting technology with potential military use fall into the hands of companies connected to the Chinese government.
The Biden administration tightened the restrictions significantly. 
During Biden's four-year tenure, Nvidia's share of the Chinese market dropped from 95% to 50%, Mr Huang said on Tuesday.
He argued that the restrictions had pushed Chinese companies toward home-grown alternatives, spurring Chinese investment in the industry.
""The fundamental assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule in the beginning, in the first place, have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,"" he told reporters.
Mr Huang's comments reflect an ongoing debate in the US over how to balance global business interests with economic and national security concerns, against a backdrop of tensions with China.
Trump has spearheaded sweeping trade tariffs, despite objections from business groups. 
But he has taken a more mixed approach to the tech industry, from which he drew critical support during last year's re-election campaign.  
The decision to drop the most expansive Biden-era rule helped facilitate AI deals between firms such as Nvidia and countries including Saudi Arabia, which was announced during Trump's tour of the Middle East last week.
But the White House has tightened restrictions in other ways, barring US firms from sales of advanced technology to dozens of new companies, external, mostly from China. 
Last month, the Commerce Department said it would impose new licensing requirements for exports of certain Nvidia chips. 
It has said it intends to replace the Biden-era restrictions with its own approach.
It also recently issued an alert to US firms, warning them that using Huawei chips risked violating US rules.
Beijing has since pushed back against that move, accusing the US of undermining the framework agreed during trade talks in Switzerland earlier this month."

The Trump administration has said it will roll back Biden-era police reform efforts in cities where there has been controversy over high-profile police killings and brutality. 
The US justice department said on Wednesday it would dismiss oversight agreements reached with the police departments in Louisville, Kentucky and Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
It will also be scrapping investigations into police constitutional violations in six other cities, including Phoenix and Memphis.
The announcement comes just days before the fifth anniversary of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in 2020 after being arrested in Minneapolis, sparking protests and a national reckoning on racial inequities.
The police officer involved, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder charges and is serving a 22-year prison sentence.
Announcing the move, the Department of Justice (DoJ) criticised the administration of former President Joe Biden for enacting ""sweeping"" oversight agreements ""that would have imposed years of micromanagement"" of local police by federal courts.
The agreements were ""handcuffing"" local departments, said Harmeet K Dhillon, the assistant attorney general of the justice department's civil rights division
The DoJ said it would also move to dismiss two lawsuits filed against police in Louisville and Minneapolis that accuse law enforcement of unconstitutional police practices.
Investigations into several other police departments will also be closed.
The DoJ under former Biden - which was led by then-attorney general Merrick Garland - had opened civil investigations into 12 state and local law enforcement agencies since 2021.
Four of those - in Minneapolis, Louisville, Phoenix and Lexington, Mississippi - were completed, and issued reports of systemic police misconduct.
The investigations were a result of mounting public pressure to address instances of police brutality after several high-profile cases of police killings of black Americans, which led to accusations of systemic racism against law enforcement agencies across the US. 
Among those cases are the deaths of Mr Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a hospital worker who was shot multiple times and killed in Louisville as officers stormed her home in ""no-knock"" raid in 2020.
An ex-officer with the Louisville Metro Police, Brett Hankison, was found guilty of using excessive force in Ms Taylor's death.
The Biden-era DoJ reached accountability agreements with both the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments, but they were not formally enacted.
They included measures like enhanced training, accountability, and improved data collection of police activity. 
The Trump administration said those findings relied on ""flawed methodologies and incomplete data"".
The move comes amid a large upheaval of the justice department's civil rights division since Trump's re-election. 
Around 70% of the lawyers in that division have quit - according to current and former officials who spoke to NPR - over concerns around its changing priorities under the new Trump administration."

Previously, anyone with an Italian ancestor who lived after 17 March, 1861 - when the Kingdom of Italy was created - qualified to be a citizen under the 'jus sanguinis', or descendent blood line law.
Under the amended law, which parliament ratified on Tuesday, applicants for an Italian passport must now have one parent or grandparent who was a citizen by birth.
The government said it changed the rules to ""enhance"" the link between Italy and the citizen abroad, avoid 'abuse' and 'commercialisation' of passports, and free up resources to clear backlogged applications.

As of the end of March, when Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government introduced the law, there were more than 60,000 pending legal proceedings for citizenship verification.
Italy's foreign ministry said in a statement then that the change ""will free up resources to make consular services more efficient, to the extent that they can be dedicated exclusively to those who have a real need, by virtue of their concrete connection with Italy"".
Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said the principle ""will not be lost"" and descendants of Italians will still be able to become citizens, but ""precise limits will be set, especially to avoid abuse or phenomena of 'commercialization' of Italian passports"".

Douglas Robert Brook is also accused of touching the children inappropriately while on a holiday in central Namibia. 
Police said the suspect targeted young boys and girls from the indigenous San community in the central Otjozondjupa region.
The 65-year old Briton faces 38 charges, including rape, indecent assault and child exploitation, Namibia local media reported. 
The British national, who arrived in Namibia last week for a holiday, is yet to respond to the charges. 
He was arrested on Sunday after he allegedly lured 34 young children with sweets and money to take their photos while they were naked. 
The UK Foreign Office said it was in contact with the local authorities regarding a British man who had been arrested in Namibia.

Maureen Mbeha, a regional police boss, told state media that the tourist sexually abused 16 teenage girls and 14 boys.
Some of the nude photographs of the children were reportedly found on the Briton's camera, which was confiscated by police after his arrest. 
He appeared in the Grootfontein Magistrate court, north of the capital, Windhoek, on Tuesday where he was denied bail and remanded in custody, the Namibia Press Agency reported. 
The case was postponed to next month after the state prosecutor requested more time for investigations.
""The tourist remains in police custody,"" Information Minister Emma Theofelus told the BBC. 
In a statement, the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism said the actions were ""deeply disrespectful to the cultural heritage of the San community"". 
""It is unacceptable for any visitor, foreign or local, to exploit or objectify indigenous communities or their children for any purpose, including photography,"" the ministry said in a statement cited by InformantÃ© newspaper.

A professional footballer has admitted his involvement in a plot to smuggle drugs with a street value of Â£600,000 from Thailand into the UK.
Jay Emmanuel-Thomas, 34, was arrested after 60kg (132lb) of cannabis was found in suitcases arriving at London Stansted Airport, Essex, on 2 September.
He was sacked by Scottish club Greenock Morton after being charged, having previously played for Arsenal, Aberdeen, Ipswich Town and England at youth level.
The father-of-two will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court at a later date.
Emmanuel-Thomas, of Cardwell Road, Gourock, near Glasgow, pleaded guilty to the offence in May. Reporting restrictions on the case were lifted on Wednesday.
Prosecutor David Josse KC said it followed a ""very thorough investigation"" by the National Crime Agency (NCA).
The drugs arrived in suitcases from Bangkok via Dubai
Emmanuel-Thomas duped his 33-year-old girlfriend, Yasmin Piotrowska, and her friend, Rosie Rowland, 28, into collecting the cannabis in Thailand and smuggling it into the UK.
They were given an all expenses paid trip to the country and promised a payment of Â£2,500, the NCA said.
Meanwhile, the footballer acted as an intermediary between criminals in both Thailand and the UK.
The women were stopped by Border Force officials at Stansted Airport after flying in from Bangkok, and found to have four suitcases containing cannabis.
However, charges against Ms Rowland, of Southend Road, Chelmsford, and Ms Piotrowska, of Purves Road, north-west London, were dropped earlier.
They wept as they were allowed to leave the dock, having denied importing cannabis between 1 July and 2 September at earlier hearings.
Emmanuel-Thomas told NCA officers he felt ""sorry for the girls""
Mr Josse said the investigation into their involvement was discontinued after analysis of Emmanuel-Thomas's mobile phone.
""They thought they were importing gold, not cannabis,"" the prosecutor said.
On his way to custody in September, Emmanuel-Thomas said ""I just feel sorry for the girls"", the NCA added.
Emmanuel-Thomas made five first team appearances for Arsenal, also going on to play for Bristol City, Queens Park Rangers, MK Dons, and Thai-based team PTT Rayong in 2019.
He was sacked by Scottish side Greenock Morton FC after being arrested at his home in on 18 September.
David Philips, a senior NCA investigator, said: ""Organised criminals like Emmanuel-Thomas can be very persuasive and offer payment to couriers. 
""But the risk of getting caught is very high and it simply isn't worth it.""
The maximum sentence for smuggling cannabis into the UK is 14 years in jail."

Congressional Republicans have accused Cuomo - who is running for New York City mayor - of lying in an investigation surrounding his response to the crisis. 
It marks the latest in a string of investigations launched by the Trump administration into Democrats or opponents since the president returned to the White House.
Cuomo's spokesperson has said the former governor is not aware of a Justice Department investigation into his actions. 
House Republicans reportedly requested Cuomo be federally investigated and argued he lie to a congressional committee when he said he was not involved in reviewing a report from the New York Health Department about how the state handled the Covid pandemic while he was governor. 
In a statement, Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesperson, told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the former governor has not had any contact from law enforcement about the case or received any subpoenas.
He said news of the investigation was leaked, describing it as ""lawfare"" and ""election interference"".
The BBC has reached out to the Cuomo and the justice department for comment.
Cuomo was frequently criticised for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and often clashed with Trump over his handling of the crisis. 
The one-time New York governor is attempting a political comeback and is leading polls in the New York City mayoral race. 
He is running against Eric Adams, who in April had a criminal case against him permanently dismissed by a federal judge after the Trump administration directed prosecutors to drop the corruption charges.
The move led to the resignation of Manhattan's top federal prosecutor who accused Adams of striking a deal with the Trump administration to dismiss his case in exchange for immigration enforcement.
Cuomo is one of a handful of Democrats being targeted by Trump. 
Earlier this week, a Trump-allied prosecutor charged a New Jersey Democratic lawmaker with assault following an alleged incident outside an immigration facility."

A former leading Ukrainian official has been shot dead outside an American school in the Spanish capital Madrid, authorities have confirmed.
Andriy Portnov, 51, had just dropped his children off at the school in the Pozuelo de AlarcÃ³n area of the city and was walking to his car in the school parking area.
At least one unidentified attacker fired several shots at the victim before fleeing into a wooded area in a nearby public park, witnesses said.
Portnov had been an MP and deputy head in the administration of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian president ousted in 2014 after months of protests. 
He had previously been an MP in Yulia Tymoshenko's governing party, but switched to Yanukovych's team when he won the presidential election in 2010.
He left Ukraine after the revolution only to return in 2019 after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president. 
He then left Ukraine again, and in 2021 was sanctioned by the US Treasury, which said he had been ""widely known as a court fixer"" who had taken steps to control the judiciary and undermine reform efforts.
It was not clear who was behind the shooting that took place at about 09:15 local time (07:15 GMT) on Wednesday, reportedly as children were still entering the school.
Witnesses said there had been five or six shots. One student told Spanish TV he thought they were ""firecrackers or fireworks"".  A woman who had rushed to Portnov's aid began to scream, according to El Mundo newspaper.
Portnov had just dropped off his children when he was shot close to his Mercedes car
Police drones and a helicopter searched the area for a gunman who, according to witnesses, was a thin man in a blue tracksuit. 
Spanish reports suggested the gunman may have had at least one accomplice riding on a motorbike. Hours after the shooting no arrests had been made.
A similar gun attack took place in 2018, when a Colombian drug trafficker was fatally shot outside a British Council school a few kilometres away.
But the motive behind Wednesday's attack is not yet known. Emergency services at the scene could only confirm that that Portnov had suffered several bullet wounds in the back and the head.
Portnov's black Mercedes car was cordoned off and the school wrote to parents to confirm that all the students inside were safe.
His body was later taken away for a post mortem examination.
Portnov had successfully challenged a series of lawsuits against him in recent years, both in Ukraine and abroad.
The European Union imposed sanctions on Portnov, but he challenged the move in court and won the case.
Ukraine's SBU security service had also opened a case for suspected treason over Russia's annexation of Crimea but that was dropped when it concluded no offence had been committed.
Although Ukraine's intelligence services have been linked to several killings in Russia and occupied areas of Ukraine, a fatal attack in Spain in February last year was linked to Russian hitmen.
The victim, a Russian helicopter pilot, was shot dead near Alicante, months after defecting to Ukraine.
Authorities in Kyiv said they had offered to protect Maxim Kuzminov in Ukraine, but he is believed to have moved to Spain's south-east coast under a false identity."

Access to the social media platform X has been restricted in Tanzania after some official accounts of government and private institutions were targeted by hackers.
On Tuesday, the official police account was compromised, with sexually explicit material and false information that the president had died being posted. 
The police dissociated itself from the information and said an investigation was under way to identify those responsible.
Hours later data from the internet monitoring organisation Netblocks showed that X was ""unreachable on major internet providers"", external across the country.
Users in Dar es Salaam, the country's biggest city, could still not access the site on Wednesday, unless they use virtual private networks (VPNs), which is illegal without a permit, although some people in other regions indicated they were able to log on. 
The authorities have not commented on whether they are blocking access to X.
But Information Minister Jerry Silaa has acknowledged the hacking and assured MPs in parliament that the affected government social media accounts had since been secured.
Earlier, government spokesman Gerson Msigwa warned those responsible that immediate action was being taken.
The problems with accessing X come amid the continued uproar over the deportation of prominent Kenyans - a move that prevented them from attending the court case of opposition leader Tundu Lissu, who is accused of treason.
On Monday, the president warned activists from its northern neighbour that she would not allow them to ""meddle"" in her country's affairs and cause ""chaos"".
She spoke after Kenya's former Justice Minister Martha Karua along with some others, who had all travelled to attend Lissu's court case, were deported.
Another Kenyan activist, Boniface Mwangi, and Ugandan Agather Atuhaire were arrested in Dar es Salaam by suspected military officers on Monday and their whereabouts remain unknown.
Tanzanian authorities have not commented on their whereabouts.
Mwangi's wife, Njeri, told the BBC's Newsday programme that she had last heard from him on Monday and had not been able to establish where he was.
""I'm actually concerned for his life. I know my husband, he would have communicated, he'd find a way to call or text me and because he hasn't, makes me very worried about what state he is in,"" she said.
Boniface Mwabukusi, the president of the Tanganyika Law Society, the body representing lawyers in mainland Tanzania, said on Wednesday that they had learnt that the two were being held by the immigration department. He had earlier said they had been deported.

A British teenager held in prison in Georgia on suspicion of drug offences has been described as ""not far from childhood"" by her new lawyer.
Bella Culley, 18, from Billingham on Teesside, has had the first meeting with her new family-appointed lawyer Malkhaz Salakaia, who said he had to explain to her where she was geographically.
She is being detained for 55 days before trial while the prosecution investigates where the 12kg (26lbs) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lbs) of hashish found in a travel bag came from, and whether she was planning on handing it over to someone else.
Mr Salakaia said Miss Culley was in ""good health"" but he would not describe her as an adequate adult.
The lawyer, who does not speak English and specialises in juvenile law, has been communicating with his client using a translator.
Their first meeting lasted two hours in prison number 5, near the town of Rustavi.
Mr Salakaia said his client was in good health, did not have any complaints about the place of detention and was ready to defend herself in court.
When asked whether he would describe Miss Culley as an adequate adult, his answer was ""no"".
He said he had the impression she was ""not far from childhood"".

During their meeting, the 18-year-old was also giving evidence to Georgian investigators. 
Miss Culley asked for advice about what to say and on some questions she chose to remain silent.
At the previous pre-trial hearing on 13 May, Miss Culley told the court she was pregnant.
Georgian Police said officers had seized marijuana and the narcotic drug hashish in a travel bag at Tbilisi International Airport.
The BBC understands Miss Culley arrived in Tbilisi on a flight from Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, on 10 May.

The BBC has been told the British Embassy has advised the teenager's family not to speak to the press.
Miss Culley was charged by Georgian police with illegally buying, possessing and importing large quantities of narcotics.
A spokesperson said the arrest was the result of a joint operation between multiple departments and, if she was found guilty, Miss Culley could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment.

South Africa's president has faced tough challenges before - he was the chief negotiator for Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) during talks to end white-minority rule in the early 1990s - but his forthcoming meeting in the White House will require all his charm.
Cyril Ramaphosa wants to mend his nation's fractured relationship with the US - and his famous negotiating skills will be put to the test as he tries to win over the world's most powerful leader.
US President Donald Trump and his team have been uncharacteristically quiet about the trip, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declining on Monday to provide any details - or even publicly acknowledge that the visit is taking place.
""The trade relations are what's most important - that's what has brought us here,"" Ramaphosa said in Washington on Tuesday. ""We want to come out of the United States with a really good trade deal. We want to strengthen those relations and we want to consolidate good relations between our two countries.""
The two have been at loggerheads for months, with Trump repeatedly insisting that South Africa's Afrikaner community is facing a ""genocide"" - a claim amplified by his close adviser Elon Musk, the South African-born tech billionaire, even though it has been widely discredited.

Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?
Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?
Racially charged row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink

Tensions ramped up days after Trump took office for his second term in January when President Ramaphosa signed into law a controversial bill allowing South Africa's government to expropriate privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"".
This only served to tarnish the image of Africa's biggest economy in the eyes of the Trump administration - already angered by its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to help members from the Afrikaner community, who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers, to settle in the US as ""refugees"".
South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was also expelled in March after accusing Trump of ""mobilising a supremacism"" and trying to ""project white victimhood as a dog whistle"". 
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Rasool was a ""race-baiting politician"" who was ""no longer welcome in our great country"".
The arrival of the first group of Afrikaners in the US last week further inflamed the situation, with Trump again doubling down on his claims that white farmers were being ""brutally killed"" and their ""land is being confiscated"" - which has been repeatedly denied by the South Africa government.
According to South African political analyst Anthoni van Nieuwkerk, Ramaphosa's decision to go the White House is a ""high-risk strategy"", especially given Trump's recent hard-line stance.
Prof Van Nieuwkerk predicts two likely scenarios playing out - the first sees ""pleasant and cordial"" interaction and the reset that South Africa is keen on ""if rational minds prevail and if a lot of homework has been done"" on both sides.
The expulsion of South Africa's US ambassador Ebrahim Rasool added to tensions between Pretoria and Washington
But he warns should ""emotional minds prevail"" and the focus be on white genocide claims, things could unravel quickly.
""If the South African delegation cannot convince the Trump administration of the right of South Africa to exercise its own policy choices domestically and internationallyâ¦ then the Oval Office moment will be used by Trump to humiliate Ramaphosa and to read him the riot act,"" the University of South Africa academic said.
""That second scenario is not what we want.""
He hopes that South Africa's delegation has arrived in the US with an ""enticing proposal"", adding: ""The negotiations cannot start in the Oval Office, in front of the cameras. 
""That live moment must be the conclusion of a negotiation that should have happened earlier.""
On this score, he says South Africa does have an ace up its sleeve: Ramaphosa, known for his negotiating skills and warmth.
He knows what buttons to press - and finding common ground over golf could be the swing he takes. The 72-year-old has already invited the US leader for a friendly round of golf during the G20 Summit taking place in South Africa in November - and has included two professional golfers in his entourage to Washington: Ernie Els and Retief Goosen.
""Whether people like Cyril Ramaphosa or not, we have to acknowledge that he was one of the key players in the transition from apartheid to democracy. He made it happen because of his personality and style,"" Prof Van Nieuwkerk said.
Dr Lubna Nadvi, a political analyst based at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, agrees the South African president has the personality to ""handle the situation should things get out of hand"".
""I anticipate that this face-to-face meeting will allow for the relationship to be strengthened, for facts to be placed on the table,"" she said, adding that the ""propaganda"" that had influenced Trump would have to be tackled.
It was important for Ramaphosa's team to get the US to ""accept that South Africa is a sovereign country and is entitled to take the decisions it wants to take"", Dr Nadvi said.
Ramaphosa's spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, told the BBC it was hoped the trip would ""set in motion a process towards the normalisation of diplomatic relations"" and ""lay the foundation"" for improved trade relations.
Given that it had all been confirmed at short notice, the South African delegation - which includes four senior cabinet ministers - had had little time to set up a ""formal programme"", he said.
But he suggested it was likely to focus on extending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), a 25-year-old piece of US legislation guaranteeing duty-free access to American consumers for certain goods from Africa.
South Africa is one of the largest exporters under Agoa, generating about $2.7bn (Â£2bn) in revenue in 2023, mostly from the sale of vehicles, jewellery and metals.
There is concern the deal may not be renewed when it comes up for review later this year or that if it is, South Africa may be excluded from the new agreement.
""In the absence of that continuation or extension of Agoa, we are ready to engage with the Trump administration over a new trade relationship framework that we believe will be mutually beneficial,"" Mr Magwenya said.
On the souring of relations between Pretoria and Washington, he said South Africa hoped to have a ""frank, constructive discussion about them"".
Interestingly Agricultural Minister John Steenhuisen is part of the delegation. His Democratic Alliance is part of South Africa's coalition government and has been a vocal critic of the ANC's empowerment policies, saying they lead to cronyism and corruption. The ANC denies this.
Speaking of the ICJ case, in which South Africa accused Israel in December 2023 of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza - an allegation Israel denies - Mr Magwenya admitted it might ""lead to a robust discussion"".
""Procedurally, we can't withdraw that issue [and it] will remain in contention.
""However, with respect to the humanitarian crisis and its alleviation, there's agreement there with President Trump and we will focus more on what we can do together on those areas where we agree.""
On Friday, Trump acknowledged ""a lot of people are starving"" in Gaza following Israel's recent blockade of humanitarian supplies to the territory - comments that have led to a ""basic amount of food"" entering Gaza.
Mr Magwenya also made the point that South Africa would not be heading into Wednesday's meeting ""with a begging bowl"".
""As much as South Africa needs access to one of the world's largest markets... the United States equally needs certain products and goods out of South Africa.""
South Africa currently exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese, as well as precious stones, metals and fruit.
Its ""geo-strategic location"" also made it ""attractive"" to the US, Prof Van Nieuwkerk added.
Painting a worst-case scenario, the analyst said: ""There are players who would like to see us fail and then step in and... displace our role in Africa. This is the price we will pay if it goes wrong in the Oval Office"".
But Mr Magwenya was at pains to explain the White House meeting was not a ""sprint"" to a solution.
""What it represents is the beginning of a process towards resolving the current impasse and normalising diplomatic relations,"" he said.
""Whether that meeting has a negative or positive outcome, it will be nonetheless a major opportunity for us to begin towards normalising the relationship.""

233,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqj77pgyq81o,2025-05-21 11:39:48,"British soldiers make Everest history using new method,","The four British former soldiers aim to be back in London within the week
Four British former special forces soldiers have set a record by climbing Mount Everest in under five days without acclimatising on the mountain, as part of a high-speed expedition controversially aided by xenon gas.
The team, which included a UK government minister, summited the world's highest peak early on Wednesday.
Xenon was used to help them pre-acclimatise to low oxygen at high altitudes. Climbers usually spend between six to eight weeks on Everest before summiting.
Organisers said the use of xenon had made such a fast ascent possible. But the science around using the gas remains disputed and many in the mountaineering industry have criticised it.
Although this expedition is a record Everest ascent without acclimatising in the Himalayas, it's not the fastest Everest time. 
That record still belongs to Lhakpa Gelu Sherpa, who climbed from base camp to the summit in 10 hours and 56 minutes in 2003 â but he did this after acclimatising on the mountain.
The xenon-aided team, accompanied by five Sherpa guides and a cameraman, reached the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) summit early on Wednesday, and began their descent soon afterwards.
""They started on the afternoon of 16th May and summited on the morning of the 21st, taking four days and approximately 18 hours,"" expedition organiser Lukas Furtenbach told the BBC.

Traditionally climbers have spent weeks between base camp and higher camps before summiting Everest
The four former soldiers, who include veterans minister Alastair Carns, slept for six weeks in special tents before travelling to Nepal to help them acclimatise to decreased levels of oxygen at high altitude.
They then flew to Everest base camp from Kathmandu and started climbing straight away, Mr Furtenbach said. They used supplemental oxygen, like other climbers, during the expedition.
Climbers usually spend weeks going up and down between base camp and higher camps before making the final push for the summit.
They need to do that to get used to thinner oxygen levels at high mountain altitudes. Above 8,000m, known as the death zone, available oxygen is only a third of that present at sea level.
But the four British men in the team did none of that.
""The team made a three-month acclimatisation programme in simulated altitude before coming to Nepal,"" Mr Furtenbach said.
The simulated altitude was created in what is known as hypoxic tents from which oxygen is sucked out using a generator, bringing it to levels present at high mountain altitudes.
Then the climbers inhaled xenon gas at a clinic in Germany two weeks before the expedition, said Mr Furtenbach.
""It helps to protect the body from altitude sickness,"" he said.
Some researchers say xenon increases production of a protein called erythropoietin that fights hypoxia, a condition that occurs when the body can't get enough oxygen.
They say it does that by increasing the number of red blood cells that contain haemoglobin, which transports oxygen around the body, but this remains a disputed subject and many say further studies are required.

The simulated altitude was created in hypoxic tents from which oxygen is sucked out using a generator
Some in the mountaineering industry have cautioned against the use of xenon gas.
""According to current literature, there is no evidence that breathing in xenon improves performance in the mountains, and inappropriate use can be dangerous,"" the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation said in a statement in January.
""Acclimatisation to altitude is a complex process that affects the various organs/systems such as the brain, lungs, heart, kidneys and blood to different degrees, and is not fully understood.
""From a physiological point of view, a single, one-off drug cannot be the key to improved acclimatisation or increased performance.""
Adrian Ballinger, who heads another expedition team climbing Everest from the Chinese side to the north, also makes his clients undergo pre-acclimatisation training like using hypoxic tents to shorten time on the mountains. But he opposes using xenon gas.
""If you're promoting xenon as a performance enhancer, but you're not also willing to examine what that means for fairness and integrity in the mountains, it's a problem,"" he told the BBC.
""People are grasping at shortcuts instead of doing the real work of acclimatisation and training.""
But now that the British team have made their groundbreaking Everest ascent, expedition operators think, and some worry, that this method may be used by other climbers too.
""If that happens then it will certainly have a direct, negative impact on the tourism industry as the length of time mountaineers stay will come down significantly,"" said Damber Parajuli, president of the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal.
""Also, acclimatising on the mountains is the basic rule of mountaineering. If that is not done then authorities should not be giving them certificates certifying that they climbed the mountain.""
Nepal's tourism department officials said they were not aware the British team were climbing Everest without acclimatisation.
""Now that we know about it, we will be discussing the issue and decide on our future course of action,"" Narayan Regmi, director general at Nepal's department of tourism told the BBC.
But why climb the highest peak at such speed?
""A shorter expedition has a lower carbon footprint and less ecological impact,"" said Mr Furtenbach.
""And it is safer for climbers because they can climb the mountain in good health and they are exposed to high altitude risks and mountain hazards for shorter time compared to when they are acclimatising on the mountain."""

Witnesses said an armed man first opened fire on GuzmÃ¡n, who had stopped her car by the side of a busy avenue to pick up her colleague, and then on MuÃ±oz, who was about to get into GuzmÃ¡n's car for their morning commute.
The gunman is believed to have escaped on a motorbike and have had at least one accomplice. The possible motive for the killing is still unknown but the attack is the latest in a series of murders of local politicians across the country.
Mayor Brugada was visibly upset during a news conference when she recalled how she had ""shared dreams and struggles"" with her two aides over the years they had worked for her.
She said she would ensure the murders would not go unpunished. 
President Claudia Sheinbaum was informed of the shooting during her daily morning news conference by the security minister, Omar GarcÃ­a Harfuch, who has himself been a target of an armed ambush in the past.
President Sheinbaum described it as ""a deplorable incident"" and offered Mayor Brugada, who is from the same party as the president, all the support she may need. 
Police seized a motorbike and another vehicle they think was used in the attack, while forensic experts examined GuzmÃ¡n's bullet-pierced car. 
CCTV footage from a nearby building shows a man carrying a motorcycle helmet in one hand and a gun in another, approach GuzmÃ¡n's car from the front.
He fires through the windscreen, then shoots MuÃ±oz, before again firing at GuzmÃ¡n.
As he runs away, he turns around and fires another shot at MuÃ±oz, who is collapsing on the pavement. 
GuzmÃ¡n was shot in her black Audi as she stopped to pick up MuÃ±oz
Brugada, 61, was elected mayor of Mexico City in June of last year. The position is considered the second most powerful in the country after that of the president. 
While local politicians, especially the mayors of small towns, are often targeted in Mexico, attacks on politicians in the capital are more unusual.
One high-profile exception is the ambush in 2020 of GarcÃ­a Harfuch, who was Mexico City's chief of police at the time. 
More than two dozen gunmen opened fire on his car and killed two of his bodyguards and a passer-by in one of the most brazen attacks to have occurred in the city.
GarcÃ­a Harfuch was hit three times, but survived and went on to become Mexico's security minister in October of last year. 
He said the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful criminal groups, was behind that incident.
Investigators have not yet said who they think was behind Tuesday's murder of the two aides, but security experts say the deliberate and precise way the gunman operated indicates that he is a professional hitman.

Indian writer, lawyer and activist Banu Mushtaq has made history by becoming the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker prize with her short story anthology, Heart Lamp.
It is the first short story collection to win the presigious prize. Judges praised her characters as ""astonishing portraits of survival and resilience"".
Featuring 12 short stories written by Mushtaq between 1990 and 2023, Heart Lamp poignantly captures the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India.
The stories were selected and translated into English from Kannada, which is spoken in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, by Deepa Bhasthi who will share the Â£50,000 prize. 
In her acceptance speech, Mushtaq thanked readers for letting her words wander into their hearts.
""This book was born from the belief that no story is ever small; that in the tapestry of human experience, every thread holds the weight of the whole,"" she said.
""In a world that often tries to divide us, literature remains one of the last sacred spaces where we can live inside each other's minds, if only for a few pages,"" she added.
Bhasthi, who became the first Indian translator to win an International Booker, said that she hoped that the win would encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.
Manasi Subramaniam, Editor-in-chief of Penguin India, the book's publisher in India, told the BBC that the award was a significant win for regional literature.
""Following Tomb of Sand's landmark win in 2022 [Geetanjali Shree's book was translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell], Heart Lamp's triumph this year is a powerful reminder that literature in India's many languages demands our full attention. We owe it our ears,"" said Subramaniam
Mushtaq's body of work is well-known among book lovers, but the Booker International win has shone a bigger spotlight on her life and literary oeuvre, which mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society.
It is this self-awareness that has, perhaps, helped Mushtaq craft some of the most nuanced characters and plotlines.
""In a literary culture that rewards spectacle, Heart Lamp insists on the value of attention - to lives lived at the edges, to unnoticed choices, to the strength it takes simply to persist. That is Banu Mushtaq's quiet power,"" a review, external in the Indian Express newspaper says about the book.
Mushtaq grew up in a small town in the southern state of Karnataka in a Muslim neighbourhood and like most girls around her, studied the Quran in the Urdu language at school. 
But her father, a government employee, wanted more for her and at the age of eight, enrolled her in a convent school where the medium of instruction was the state's official language - Kannada. 
Mushtaq worked hard to become fluent in Kannada, but this alien tongue would become the language she chose for her literary expression. 
She began writing while still in school and chose to go to college even as her peers were getting married and raising children.
It would take several years before Mushtaq was published and it happened during a particularly challenging phase in her life.
Her short story appeared in a local magazine a year after she had married a man of her choosing at the age of 26, but her early marital years were also marked by conflict and strife - something she openly spoke of, in several interviews.
Banu Mushtaq (left) and Deepa Bhasthi (right) hold copies of Heart Lamp
In an interview, external with Vogue magazine, she said, ""I had always wanted to write but had nothing to write (about) because suddenly, after a love marriage, I was told to wear a burqa and dedicate myself to domestic work. I became a mother suffering from postpartum depression at 29"".
In the another interview, external to The Week magazine, she spoke of how she was forced to live a life confined within the four walls of her house. 
Then, a shocking act of defiance set her free.
""Once, in a fit of despair, I poured white petrol on myself, intending to set myself on fire. Thankfully, he [the husband] sensed it in time, hugged me, and took away the matchbox. He pleaded with me, placing our baby at my feet saying, 'Don't abandon us',"" she told the magazine.
In Heart Lamp, her female characters mirror this spirit of resistance and resilience.
""In mainstream Indian literature, Muslim women are often flattened into metaphors â silent sufferers or tropes in someone else's moral argument. Mushtaq refuses both. Her characters endure, negotiate, and occasionally push back â not in ways that claim headlines, but in ways that matter to their lives,"" according to a review of , externalthe book in The Indian Express newspaper. 
Mushtaq went on to work as a reporter in a prominent local tabloid and also associated with the Bandaya movement - which focussed on addressing social and economic injustices through literature and activism.
After leaving journalism a decade later, she took up work as a lawyer to support her family.
In a storied career spanning several decades, she has published a copious amount of work; including six short story collections, an essay collection and a novel. 
But her incisive writing has also made her a target of hate.
In an interview, external to The Hindu newspaper, she spoke about how in the year 2000, she received threatening phone calls after she expressed her opinion supporting women's right to offer prayer in mosques. 
A fatwa - a legal ruling as per Islamic law - was issued against her and a man tried to attack her with a knife before he was overpowered by her husband.
But these incidents did not faze Mushtaq, who continued to write with fierce honesty.
""I have consistently challenged chauvinistic religious interpretations. These issues are central to my writing even now. Society has changed a lot, but the core issues remain the same. Even though the context evolves, the basic struggles of women and marginalised communities continue,"" she told, external The Week magazine.
Over the years Mushtaq's writings have won numerous prestigious local and national awards including the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Award and the Daana Chintamani Attimabbe Award.
In 2024, the translated English compilation of Mushtaq's five short story collections published between 1990 and 2012 - Haseena and Other Stories - won the PEN Translation Prize.

A Russian missile strike on a training exercise in Ukraine's Sumy border region has killed six servicemen and wounded more than 10 others, says Ukraine's National Guard.
Russia's defence ministry had earlier released a video purporting to show an Iskander missile attack on a training camp, and state news agency Tass said up to 70 people had died.
The Sumy region has come under repeated bombardment, and Ukraine launched a months-long occupation of part of Russia's neighbouring Kursk region from there.
The Ukrainian military said the aim of the offensive had been to help create a buffer zone to protect Sumy, but some have complained of the scale of military losses.
Separately, the Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had visited officials in Kursk the previous day, in his first visit to the region since Ukrainian forces were pushed out.
He met volunteers as well as acting local governor Alexander Khinshtein, and he toured a nearby nuclear power plant, state media reported.
The deadly Russian strike on Ukrainian servicemen in Sumy was confirmed early on Wednesday by Ukraine's National Guard, which said the attack took place while the unit was carrying out exercises at a firing range. The commander was suspended and an official investigation launched, it added.
The unverified Russian military video showed dozens of servicemen walking on a path near a wooded area followed by an explosion and a large plume of smoke.
Research by BBC Verify showed the training camp was targeted in the far north of the Sumy region, some way south of the Russian border.
The attack comes as a heavy blow to the Ukrainian military, and the National Guard said it had previously developed an ""algorithm of actions"" as well as orders to deal with the threat of air strikes and people gathered in one place.
Italy ready to help talks if Vatican agrees to Trump war mediation plan
Ukraine's general staff said this week that it had thwarted Russia's bid to establish a ""security zone"" in Sumy region, and argued that its Kursk operation had ""strategic significance"", forcing Russia to divert its ""most capable units"" to tackle the offensive. 
The Kremlin also sent thousands of North Koreans soldiers to the region in a bid to recapture the area.
However, last week a battalion commander called Oleksandr Shyrshyn was quoted as criticising the ""moronic tasks"" set by the military leadership as well as unjustified losses.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has since annexed four eastern regions of Ukraine's sovereign territory, including large areas that remain under Ukrainian control.
Ukraine's Kursk offensive has not succeeded in halting Russia's push to capture more territory in the east, although its advance along the front lines has been very slow.
Ukrainian forces on the eastern flanks say Russia launched 14 attacks overnight towards Druzhba, Petrivka, and Toretsk.
A Ukrainian soldier close to the eastern city of Pokrovsk told the BBC that there has been a major push by Russian forces there too. 
He said invading troops had targeted a major road that is used as a supply line, adding that they had been struggling to hold their positions for some time.
Hopes of an imminent ceasefire in the war are fading, despite low-level talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul last Friday.
Although US President Donald Trump suggested the Vatican might mediate further talks, the Vatican said the idea of hosting, or even mediating talks was more a hope for now than any concrete plan.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he expected Russia to present its ""broad terms that would allow us to move towards a ceasefire"", however Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has said Russia is merely ""trying to buy time in order to continue its war and occupation""."
238,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy33n484x0o,2025-05-20 20:33:08,"Trump unveils plans for 'Golden Dome' defence system,","The US has selected a design for the futuristic ""Golden Dome"" missile defence system, says President Donald Trump, adding that it will be operational by the end of his time in office.
Just days after returning to the White House in January, Trump unveiled his intentions for the system, aimed at countering ""next-generation"" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.
An initial sum of $25bn (Â£18.7bn) has been earmarked in a new budget bill - although the government has estimated it could end up costing 20 times that over decades.
There are also doubts about whether the US will be able to deliver a comprehensive defence system for such a huge land mass.
Officials warn that existing systems have not kept pace with increasingly sophisticated weapons possessed by potential adversaries.
A briefing document recently released by the Defense Intelligence Agency noted that missile threats ""will expand in scale and sophistication"", with China and Russia actively designing systems ""to exploit gaps"" in US defences.
Seven days into his second administration, Trump ordered the defence department to submit plans for a system that would deter and defend against aerial attacks, which the White House said remain ""the most catastrophic threat"" facing the US. 
Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said the system would consist of ""next-generation"" technologies across land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. 
Trump added that the system would be ""capable even of intercepting missiles launched from the other side of the world, or launched from space"". 
The system is partly inspired by Israel's Iron Dome, which the country has used to intercept rockets and missiles since 2011.
The Golden Dome, however, would be many times larger and designed to combat a wider range of threats, including hypersonic weapons able to move faster than the speed of sound and fractional orbital bombardment systems - also called Fobs - that could deliver warheads from space. 
""Israel's missile defence challenge is a lot easier than one in the United States,"" Marion Messmer, a senior research fellow at London-based Chatham House, told the New York Times, external. ""The geography is much smaller and the angles and directions and the types of missiles are more limited.""
Shashank Joshi, defence editor at the Economist, told the BBC the Golden Dome would probably work by using thousands of satellites to spot and track missiles and then use interceptors in orbit to fire at the missiles as they take off and take them out.
He said the US military would take the plan very seriously but it was unrealistic to think it would be completed during Trump's term, and the huge cost would suck up a large chunk of the US defence budget.
Trump said on Tuesday that the programme would require an initial investment of $25bn, with a total cost of $175bn over time. 
The Congressional Budget Office, however, has estimated that the government could ultimately spend more, up to $542bn over 20 years, on the space-based parts of the system alone. 
Trump said Canada had asked to be a part of the system. 
During a visit to Washington earlier this year, then-Canadian defence minister Bill Blair acknowledged that Canada was interested in participating in the dome project, arguing that it ""makes sense"" and was in the country's ""national interest"".
The many aspects of the system will fall under one centralised command, US defence officials have said. Space Force General Michael Guetlein will oversee the project."

The UN says no aid has yet been distributed in Gaza despite aid lorries starting to cross the border after an 11-week blockade. 
Israeli officials said 93 trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, carrying aid including flour, baby food, medical equipment, and pharmaceutical drugs.
But the UN said that despite trucks reaching the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, no aid has been distributed so far.
Its spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said a team ""waited several hours"" for Israel to allow them to access the area but ""unfortunately, they were not able to bring those supplies into our warehouse"".
Israel agreed on Sunday to allow a ""basic amount of food"" to enter Gaza, where global experts have warned of a looming famine.
Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Civil Defence service said on Wednesday that 15 people, including a child, were killed in air strikes since midnight local time.

Palestinians mourn people killed in Israeli strikes in southern Gaza 
International pressure on Israel has continued to grow.
The UK said it would be suspending trade talks over what it described as Israel's ""morally unjustifiable"" military escalation in Gaza, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer describing the situation as ""intolerable"".
Meanwhile, the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc would be reviewing its trade agreement with Israel in light of its actions in Gaza.
Dujarric said the aid operation was made ""complex"" as Israel required the UN to ""offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing, and reload them separately once they secure our teams' access from inside the Gaza Strip"". 
He added the arrival of the supplies was a positive development but described it as ""a drop in the ocean of what's needed"". 
UN bodies estimate 600 trucks a day are required to begin tackling Gaza's chronic humanitarian crisis.
Stacks of aid are seen at the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza on Tuesday
Earlier, the UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC thousands of babies could die in Gaza if Israel does not immediately let aid in.
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fletcher said: ""There are 14,000 babies that will die in the next 48 hours unless we can reach them.""
When pressed on how he had arrived at that figure, he said there were ""strong teams on the ground"" operating in medical centres and schools - but did not provide further details.
The BBC later asked for clarification on the figure from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which said: ""We are pointing to the imperative of getting supplies in to save an estimated 14,000 babies suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza, as the IPC partnership has warned about. We need to get the supplies in as soon as possible, ideally within the next 48 hours.""
It highlighted a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) which stated 14,100 severe cases of acute malnutrition are expected to occur among children aged six to 59 months between April 2025 and March 2026.
The IPC report says this could take place over the course of about a year - not 48 hours.
When pressed on the figures at a news conference, UNOCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said: ""For now let me just say that we know for a fact that there are babies who are in urgent life-saving need of these supplements that need to come in because their mothers are unable to feed themselves.""
""And if they do not get those, they will be in mortal danger,"" he said. 
Last week, the Hamas-run health ministry reported 57 children had died from the effects of malnutrition over the past 11 weeks.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday welcomed Israel's decision to allow some aid into Gaza, telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: ""We are pleased to see that aid is starting to flow in again.""  
Replying to a Democrat who said the number of aid trucks allowed in was too little, Rubio said: ""I understand your point that it's not in sufficient amounts, but we were pleased to see that decision was made.""
On Monday, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada issued a statement calling on the Israeli government to ""stop its military operations"" and ""immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza"".
As part of its announcement on Wednesday, the UK also issued sanctions on several prominent Israeli settlers and settler-linked groups. 
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry."

India's top court has granted interim bail to an Indian professor who was arrested over his remarks about the recent military hostilities between India and Pakistan.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Ashoka University, was arrested from his home in Delhi on Sunday.
He has been accused of endangering national sovereignty and promoting enmity between groups, based on a complaint filed by a youth member of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He denies the allegations.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ordered Mr Mahmudabad's release but refused to put a hold on the investigation against him. 
""Having regard to the two online posts that have led to the FIR [complaint], we are satisfied that no case of staying the investigation is made out,"" the court said, adding that a three-member special investigation team will further look into the case. 
The judges have also barred Mr Mahmudabad from writing any online article or making speeches online related to the posts that are being investigated.
Shortly after the verdict, Ashoka University released a statement saying it was ""heartened"" by the court's decision to grant Mr Mahmudabad bail. 
""It has provided great comfort to his family and all of us at Ashoka University,"" it said. 
Mr Mahmudabad's arrest had sparked criticism from academics and rights groups, who called the allegations ""baseless"" and the arrest a form of ""censorship"".
The case stems from two public social media posts written by Mr Mahmudabad, in which he talked about India's military action against Pakistan. 
Earlier this month, tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours reached an unprecedented high after India launched air strikes against Pakistan in response to a deadly attack in the tourist town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the killings, a charge Pakistan denied. This was followed by four days of military escalations, which ended with a ceasefire brokered by the US. 
""There are those who are mindlessly advocating for war,"" the 42-year-old professor wrote in one post on 8 May, ""but they have never seen one, let alone lived in or visited a conflict zone"". 
In the same post, he expressed support for India's response while warning of the brutality inherent in any war. He also highlighted the significance of two women officers - one of whom is Muslim - presenting the operation's details during daily media briefings. 
""I am very happy to see so many right wing commentators applauding Colonel Sofiya Qureshi,"" he wrote, but ""they should also demand that the victims of mob lynching, arbitrary demolitions [of houses], others who are victims of the BJP's hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens"". Several rights groups have pointed out that there has been a rise in violence and hate speech against Muslims in India in the past  decade. 
Two female officers were part of India's daily press briefings on its military operations against Pakistan
Two police complaints have been filed against the professor based on the interpretation of his online remarks. 
The first complaint was filed by a BJP youth activist Yogesh (he uses only one name), on Saturday, on the basis of which Mr Mahmudabad was arrested, his lawyer Mohammad Nizam Pasha said. 
While the second complaint was filed by Renu Bhatia, the head of Haryana's State Commission for Women on Sunday.
The women's commission first issued a notice to the professor on 12 May, alleging that Mr Mahmudabad's social media posts had ""disparaged"" the two women defence officers and ""undermined their role"" in the armed forces. 
In response, Mr Mahmudabad sent a written reply to the commission's notice and his lawyers also appeared before the commission on 14 May, but it refused to hear the lawyers, Mr Pasha said.
In his written response, which he shared on social media, the academic said that his remarks had been ""misunderstood"" and that, contrary to the allegations, his post had actually praised the decision to have two women officers lead the military briefings.
""There is nothing remotely misogynistic about my comments that could be construed as anti-women,"" he said.
Several academics, activists, opposition politicians and civil society members have spoken against Mr Mahmudabad's arrest.
Mr Mahmudabad is a teacher of political science and his known for his works on religion, with a focus on Indian Muslim history. 
He comes from an aristocratic family from Uttar Pradesh state and is a member of the regional Samajwadi Party. 
After his arrest, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav posted a couplet on X, external, which included an indirect reference to the professor being arrested for telling the truth.
President of the main opposition Congress party, Mallikarjun Kharge, said, external the arrest of the professor shows how the BJP is ""fearful"" of any opinion disliked by them.

A bomb attack on a school bus in Pakistan's Balochistan region has killed at least five people and injured dozens.
The bus was carrying around 40 school children when it exploded at about 07:40 local time (02:40 GMT) just outside the remote town of Khuzdar, police told the BBC.
Three of the five people killed are children, police said. Pictures circulating on social media show the charred wreckage of a large bus, with backpacks scattered around it.
No group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far, but Balochistan, a turbulent province in the country's south west, has been plagued by a long-standing insurgency and human rights violations.
Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident as ""sheer barbarism"", calling the attackers ""beasts who target children"" in an attempt to destabilise the country.
Its military has accused neighbouring India and its proxies in Balochistan of orchestrating the explosion, though there is no evidence of this. 
Pakistan and India are just emerging from a deadly two-week conflict sparked by a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Pakistan denied involvement in those attacks, but India followed up with a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
Earlier in March, some 21 civilians and four military personnel were killed during a train siege in Balochistan's remote Sibi district.
That attack was carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group that has waged a decades-long insurgency to gain independence. 
Pakistani authorities, as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation. 
The country's military has also previously accused it of being an ""Indian proxy"" - a claim that the BLA has rejected. 
But Baloch activists have also accused Pakistan's security forces of its own atrocities. 
They say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan's security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency.

Tributes have been paid by the cast of US comedy series Cheers after George Wendt - who starred as Norm Peterson - died at the age of 76. 
Ted Danson, who played bar boss Sam Malone, said he was ""devastated to hear that Georgie is no longer with us"".
Kelsey Grammer, who played Frasier Crane before starring in his own spin-off, said in a statement to Deadline: ""I believe mourning is a private matter. But I liked George a lot. He was beloved by millions.""
Wendt starred as Norm in all 275 episodes of Cheers, which ran from 1982 to 93. He earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series.
The actor and comedian died peacefully in his sleep at his home early on Tuesday morning, his family said.
""George was a doting family man, a well-loved friend and confidant to all of those lucky enough to have known him. He will be missed forever,"" a representative told the BBC.

""I am sending all my love to Bernadette and the children,"" Danson added. ""It is going to take me a long time to get used to this. I love you, Georgie.""
Wendt had reunited with some of the cast, including Danson, Grammer, Rhea Perlman and John Ratzenberger, at the Emmy Awards in 2024.
Perlman described Wendt as ""the sweetest, kindest man I ever met"", adding that she would ""miss him more than words can say"".
And Ratzenberger said he was ""heartbroken to hear about the passing of my friend"", noting how they had ""shared a stage, a lot of laughs, and a front-row seat to one of television's most beloved friendships"".
Actress Melissa Joan Hart reflected on the handful of times they had worked together on the show Sabrina the Teenage Witch. 
""He was warm, professional and kind and our cast and crew were gifted with his presence every time. Rest in peace!"" she wrote on Instagram.
""Heaven just got a little funnier.""

Wendt also appeared in several movies such as Dreamscape, Forever Young and Gung Ho.
He also appeared as the father of a boy played by Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson's Black or White music video, external, which was released in 1991. 
He had been married to fellow actor Bernadette Birkett since 1978, with whom he had three children. 
He was also the uncle of actor and comedian Jason Sudeikis, who is most recently known for playing the title character in the sports comedy Ted Lasso. 
Wendt's character Norm was a bar regular in Cheers, and was one of the few characters to appear in every episode. 
His entrance into the bar was a running gag on the show, beginning with him greeting the other patrons followed by the crowd yelling his name. 
Speaking 20 years after the show ended, Wendt said people still recognised him because the show had been a once-in-a-generation hit.
""I live just a few blocks from where Friends was shot and from where Seinfeld was shot and I'd see the helicopters going over the studio and I'd think, wow, I'm one of a few dozen people who have a unique perspective on what all these people are going through,"" he reflected.

Taiwanese authorities have arrested two Chinese nationals who sailed over in a small boat and attempted to land on an island.
It is the third incident this month in which Chinese nationals appear to have reached Taiwan by boat, stoking security concerns.
Taiwan has accused Chinese authorities of using these incidents to ""harass"" them. Beijing has yet to respond, nor has it commented on the recent intrusions.
Taiwan considers itself a sovereign country, but China views it as one of its provinces and has not ruled out the possibility of using force to claim it.
The Taiwanese coastguard said in a statement they had detected the two men sailing into their waters on a sampan, or a small wooden boat, in the early hours of Tuesday.
The men were caught ""launching a styrofoam float"" from their Chinese-registered sampan in the waters off Erdan Island.
Pictures released by the coastguard appear to show a man kneeling on a small floating board with a paddle in his hands.
Erdan is part of Taiwan's Kinmen district, which is a mere 5km (3 miles) from the Chinese coast.
Taiwan was on high alert for possible threats from China on the day the men were apprehended: the one-year anniversary of the inauguration of Taiwanese president William Lai, whom Beijing reviles.
Last week a Chinese father and his teenage son landed in Taoyuan on the northern tip of Taiwan's main island, after crossing over in a small rubber dinghy.
Questions were raised about how they managed to travel more than 100km across the Taiwan Strait - one of the most heavily patrolled patches in the region and a busy international shipping lane - without being discovered.
The coastguard confirmed the landing occurred on 16 May, but admitted that they had not detected the boat before it landed as it was too small to be picked up on their radar technology.
The father and son, who were from the southern Chinese province of Fujian, reportedly claimed they were victims of persecution in China and wanted to ""seek freedom"" in Taiwan.
In another case that has stoked worries, a Chinese social media influencer posted several clips online appearing to show that he had travelled across the Taiwan Strait and landed on a beach, also in Taoyuan.
The influencer, who goes by the nickname Shandong Kaige, claimed he had set off from Fujian on 15 May and travelled for about nine hours on a motorised rubber dinghy. 
He was seen next to a Chinese flag on a beach, which he claimed he had planted ""on this territory so beloved by the motherland"". He also said he returned to China on the same day.
Taiwanese authorities have analysed the footage and concluded that it was authentic. They confirmed the man was in Taoyuan, but said they were still investigating whether the man had travelled by boat across the strait or had flown into Taiwan.
In one of Shandong Kaige's videos he is seen posing with a Chinese flag planted on the beach
Anyone caught illegally entering Taiwan can face up to five years in jail and a fine of up to 500,000 Taiwanese dollars (Â£12,300; $16,600).
Taiwan used to see thousands of Chinese attempting to enter illegally every year, particularly in the 1990s when Taiwan's booming economy attracted impoverished Chinese looking for work. 
While overall numbers are much lower now, there appears to be an uptick in recent years, according to official figures published in Taiwanese media.
There were 15 Chinese caught in 2023, and while there are no available figures for the whole of last year, 23 were caught between June and September.
Since January this year the coastguard has caught about 40 people including the men in Tuesday's case - although it is not known how many of those were from China.
On Tuesday, the coastguard said there has been a ""recent surge in the number of cases in which the Chinese Communist Party has used small targets to harass Taiwan"" as part of its greyzone warfare.
Taiwanese authorities have not ruled out that Beijing would ""use illegal immigration by boats to conduct cognitive warfare"", the coastguard added.
It has also said there is an ""urgent need"" to upgrade its surveillance technology to combat these threats.
Analysts say that China has been using greyzone tactics, which are manoeuvres that fall short of an invasion and exist in a grey area, to weaken Taiwan over a prolonged period. 
These include Chinese warplanes and coastguard boats repeatedly entering Taiwan's airspace and waters. 
More recently, Taiwanese authorities have alleged that Chinese-linked commercial ships have been deliberately damaging Taiwan's undersea communication cables.

The family of a British woman who died from methanol poisoning while travelling in south-east Asia are urging the government to do more to educate young people on the risks of drinking bootleg alcohol abroad.
Twenty-eight-year-old Simone White, from Orpington, died in 2024 along with five others after consuming free shots they were offered at a hostel in Laos.
The MP for Dartford raised the issue in a debate in Parliament on Tuesday, calling for compulsory education on the issue in schools.
Responding in the Westminster Hall debate, Foreign Office minister Catherine West paid tribute to Simone's family and thanked them for raising the profile of the issue.
She said the government was acting in response to the ""tragic losses"".
Amanda Dennis, a family representative, said Simone had a ""zest for life"". 
""She was very well educated... [and] well-travelled. She was a lovely young lady, who had a lot more to live for."" 
Ms Dennis added they initially thought the lawyer would pull through, but days later they were told by hospital staff there was ""no hope"" of survival. 
She said the family was ""joining forces"" with others who had lost loved ones in the same way.
""You can't have any more young people losing their lives unnecessarily,"" she said. ""It's got to stop.""
Ms Dennis hopes no other young people will die from drinking bootleg alcohol
Speaking in Parliament, Dartford MP Jim Dickson praised the ""courage"" of Simone's family and others who were ""fighting for justice"" and ""trying to raise awareness so that other families don't have to lose loved ones in the same tragic circumstances"".
In an interview with BBC South East, he said he was calling on the government to ""increase the awareness among young people of a likelihood of methanol poisoning"".
He said he wanted the Foreign Office website to be ""very, very clear"" about the risk of bootleg alcohol in certain countries and that it ""probably needs to do more"".
""Above all we think it should be in the school curriculum,"" said Ms Dickson. ""Young people should be being taught from a very early age that methanol poisoning is a possibility... and how to take action to avoid it.""
Mr Dickson said there were a number of ways young people could distinguish between ""drink that is ok and drink that might poison them"", including avoiding ""knock-off brands that are posing as mainstream brands"".
Kay Coleman, mother of Bethany who was poisoned along with Simone but survived, said they had started a petition for compulsory education on methanol poisoning in schools. 
""There needs to be more awareness,"" she said, adding that the ""message [needs to get] across fully about the dangers"" of drinking bootleg alcohol.
A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British woman who has died in Laos and we are in contact with the local authorities.""
Information on methanol poisoning in Laos, external is available on the Foreign Office website, they added.

A memorial has been unveiled to the sinking of a wartime Japanese cargo ship and the loss of more than 800 British prisoners of war.
The Lisbon Maru was torpedoed by a US submarine in October 1942, which did not know it was taking the PoWs from Hong Kong to Japan, to be used as forced labour.  
Before fleeing the sinking vessel, guards secured the hatches on the allied prisoners. ""The intent was that the PoW's would go down with the ship,"" said Ken Salmon, from Hook, whose father was saved by Chinese fishermen.
The memorial, on Qingbang Island, South East of Shanghai, was created after the descendant of another prisoner wrote directly to Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
Ken Salmon says his father's account of the atrocity could have led to the soldiers' execution
Mr Salmon's father, Andrew, was one of the lucky ones. 
He was in the ship's hold number three and was with other members of the Royal Artillery. A group managed to use a ladder and force the hatches before it broke, trapping many of the others below decks.
""Once he got out in the fresh air, he was lucky he wasn't shot,"" said Mr Salmon.
""The Japanese saw the prisoners were breaking out of the holds,"" he explained. ""They opened fire using machine guns and rifles."" 
His father, Andrew, wrote an account of what happened in a diary he managed to keep throughout his captivity, even though its discovery would probably have led to his execution. 
After the war his wife typed up his notes telling how he had dived overboard and was one of around 380 prisoners who were rescued by local fishermen.
Andrew Salmon never bore any ill will against the Japanese despite being a victim of what son Ken said was undoubtedly a ""war crime""
The Royal Artilleryman and the other survivors were recaptured by the Japanese and put on another ship to continue their journey, eventually being liberated at the end of the war in August 1945.
Reading his father's account, Ken said he regarded him as ""a bit of a hero.
""He never actually had any hatred for the Japanese, which some people find strange.""
Andrew Salmon even travelled to Osaka in the 1960s in an attempt to try and locate the camp where had been held.
The memorial depicts a fisherman reaching out to pull a PoW from the sea
Military historian, Brian Finch, who was associate producer on a documentary telling the story of the sinking said too few people knew about the Lisbon Maru.
""I think it's the inevitable consequence of people in 1945, who celebrated in May what they thought was the end of the war. 
""It was just the end of the war in Europe and they'd forgotten about people in the Far East.'
Ken Salmon has been unable to discover anything about who it was who saved his father's life, other than them being a fisherman. But having been able to travel there and thank the local community meant a lot to him.
""A lot of the PoW's were taken by the current and washed out to sea. He was lucky in so many ways.""

Some Â¥36bn ($250m; Â£186m) has been set aside for the subsidies, which will come into effect for a four-month period.
Heatstroke claimed a record 263 lives in Tokyo last summer, said the Bureau of Public Health. Many victims did not have air conditioning or chose not to use it because of high costs.
""We are worried that people might refrain from using their air conditioners because they are concerned about living expenses [and] considered what we could do to help pay their bills,"" said Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, according to the Asahi Shimbun.
""We would like to create an environment in which all Tokyoites can live in peace even in the extremely hot weather we are expected to experience this summer,"" Koike said.
By offsetting water costs, the government aims to encourage residents of the Japanese capital to use other cooling methods like air conditioning.
In more than 60% of heatstroke deaths recorded indoors last summer, the victims had not turned air conditioning on, the Tokyo Fire Department said, according to the Japan Times.
On average, base water fees in Tokyo cost between Â¥860 ($6; Â£4.50) to Â¥1,460 ($10; Â£7.50) per month, depending on the width of the household's water pipe.
Additional fees - based on water usage and paid on top of base fees - will be charged at their usual rate.
Tokyo has more than 7 million households and a population of more than 14 million, according to government statistics.
Japan recorded its hottest summer on record last year. 
Temperatures in June, July and August were 1.76 degrees higher than the average between 1991 and 2020, according to the Japan meteorological agency.
Between June and September, nearly 8,000 people in Tokyo were taken to hospitals for heatstroke - also a record - with a majority of deaths recorded among elderly people."

A former prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been sentenced to a decade's forced labour for corruption.
Augustin Matata Ponyo was found guilty of embezzling about $245m (Â£182m) of public funds by the Congolese Constitutional Court on Tuesday, alongside Deogratias Mutombo, the former governor of the DR Congo's central bank.
Matata's lawyer told Reuters news agency that the ruling was unfair and politically motivated.
Part of the funds were taken from a major agricultural development intended to tackle the country's chronic food shortages.
Matata served as prime minister of the DRC from 2012 to 2016 and now heads the country's Leadership and Governance for Development party (LGD). 
Prior to his premiership, he was finance minister and received praise from the International Monetary Fund at the time for stabilising the country's economy.
Deogratias Mutombo, the central bank's former governor, has also been sentenced to five years of forced labour in the same case and has not commented publicly on the ruling. 
Forced labour is legal in DR Congo when mandated by a court for a criminal penalty, according to the US State Department, external. 
Both men have been barred from public service for five years from the end of their terms of forced labour, the AFP news agency reports. 
Matata, who campaigned against DRC President Felix Tshisekedi in the 2023 vote before dropping out, has consistently denied the charges.
The case has stretched over almost four years since the country's Inspectorate General of Finance reported the theft from the Bukanga-Lonzo Agro-Industrial Park  in 2020.
The park was one of Africa's largest ever agricultural investments according to the Reuters news agency and the African Development Bank Group had expected to provide 22,000 jobs.
It was intended to provide reprieve to the 28 million people who currently face acute food insecurity in DR Congo, which has been plagued by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide."

Police have arrested a maintenance worker who is suspected of helping 10 inmates break out of a New Orleans jail on Friday, Louisiana's attorney general has announced.
The employee, identified as 33-year-old Sterling Williams, was arrested on Monday night.
Mr Williams is accused of turning off the water to the cell that was used for the escape, which involved removing a toilet from the wall. He said an inmate threatened to attack him with a ""shank"" - meaning makeshift knife - if he did not help, according to court documents.
Five of the inmates have been recaptured so far, Louisiana State Police said.
Police earlier said several of the detainees were facing charges of murder and other violent offences.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in her statement that Mr Williams had ""admitted to agents that one of the escapees advised him to turn the water off in the cell where the inmates escaped from"".
""Instead of reporting the inmate, Williams turned the water off as directed allowing the inmates to carry out their scheme to successfully escape,"" she added. 
He said he was forced to help the inmates escape, telling authorities that Antoine Massey - one of the six inmates still at large - ""threatened to shank him if he did not turn the water off"", according to court documents. 
Mr Williams is facing 10 counts of a charge known as principal to simple escape, and another of malfeasance in office. 
Murrill said the investigation was ongoing, and that authorities would ""uncover all the facts eventually and anyone who aided and abetted will be prosecuted to the full extent the law allows"". 
""I encourage anyone who knows anything and even those who may have provided assistance to come forward now to obtain the best possible outcome in their particular case,"" she said. 
The sheriff's office said the inmates escaped by removing a toilet, as well as some metal bars behind it
Sheriff Susan Hutson earlier said the inmates had yanked a sliding door from their jail cell off its tracks in the early hours of Friday morning.
They later ripped the toilet off the wall and broke metal bars around a hole used for piping that was exposed by the missing toilet.
The group made their escape by climbing down a wall and running across a highway, the sheriff said.
The sheriff's office released images of messages apparently left behind by the inmates.
They include the words ""To [sic] Easy LoL"", with an arrow pointing to the hole in the wall, and a smiley face with its tongue out. 
Another message, partially smudged, appears to tell officers to catch the inmates when they can.
The prison is located near the centre of New Orleans, around 3km (2 miles) from its famous French Quarter."

Judge Brian Murphy said the removals could violate his order last month barring the US government from sending migrants to third countries without being given ""meaningful opportunity"" to challenge their deportation.
In an emergency submission to the judge, immigration attorneys said a flight carrying a dozen people had landed in South Sudan on Tuesday. 
It is the latest showdown between Trump and the federal courts as the Republican president seeks to deliver on a campaign pledge for mass deportations.
Attorneys from the National Immigration Litigation Alliance asked Judge Murphy on Tuesday for an emergency order to prevent the removals, which they said had included citizens of Myanmar and Vietnam. 
The judge, a Biden appointee who is based in Boston, told a lawyer for the Department of Justice: ""I have a strong indication that my preliminary injunction order has been violated.""
""Based on what I have been told this seems like it may be contempt"", he added, according to US media.
But the justice department lawyer, Elianis Perez, said that one of the migrants, who is Burmese, had been returned to Myanmar, not South Sudan. 
She declined to disclose where the second migrant, a Vietnamese man, was deported, saying it was ""classified"". She said he had been convicted of murder.
At least one rapist was also on the deportation flight, said an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security.
Judge Murphy did not order the plane to head back to the US, but said the migrants must remain in the government's custody and be ""treated humanely"" pending a hearing on Wednesday.
He said this could entail the deportation flight being kept on the tarmac once it lands.
Judge Murphy issued a ruling on 18 April requiring that illegal migrants have a chance to challenge their removal to countries other than their homelands.
After reports surfaced that some migrants were going to be sent to Libya, Judge Murphy said any such move would violate his ruling.
The BBC has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment. 
Lawyers for the Burmese man, identified only as N.M. in the court filing, said their client speaks limited English and had refused to sign a notice of removal served on him by officials at an immigration detention centre in Texas.
On Tuesday morning an attorney emailed the centre after noticing her client was no longer showing up on a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee locator, says the court filing. She was informed he had been removed from the US.
When she asked to which country her client had been removed, the email reply said: ""South Sudan.""
The lawyers said another client, the Vietnamese man, identified only as T.T.P. in court papers, ""appears to have suffered the same fate"".
The Vietnamese man's spouse emailed his lawyer and said that the group of around 10 other individuals who were believed to have been deported included nationals of Laos, Thailand, Pakistan and Mexico, Reuters news agency reports.
""Please help!"" the spouse said in an email. ""They cannot be allowed to do this.""
The world's youngest nation, South Sudan endured a bloody civil war soon after its independence in 2011.
The US government's travel advisory states: ""Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.""
Several countries have been asked by the Trump administration to accept migrant deportations.
Earlier this month, Rwanda confirmed it was in such talks with the US, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini and Moldova have all been named in media reports.
The South Sudan deportation case is the latest constitutional clash between two equally powerful branches of government.
Another jurist, US District Judge James Boasberg in Washington DC, last month found ""probable cause"" to hold Trump officials in criminal contempt.
He ruled they had violated his order to halt deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members who had no chance to challenge their removals."

In 1989, brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents by shooting them multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills.
They were found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
However, in a resentencing hearing in Los Angeles a judge reduced their term, making them eligible for parole. 
Public interest in the case has grown since a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, was released in September.
In 2024, the previous district attorney of Los Angeles, George GascÃ³n, requested that the brothers' sentence of life without the possibility of parole be changed to 50 years to life.
The issue was put to Los Angeles County superior court Judge Michael Jesic on 13 May, who agreed. 
""I do believe they've done enough in the past 35 years that they should get that chance,"" he said, concluding a day-long hearing.
Menendez sentences reduced, given them chance of freedom
The brothers are now eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law which allows individuals who committed crimes before the age of 26 to seek a reduced sentence.
The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time. They are now aged 54 and 57.
During the hearing, family members and a former fellow inmate were among those who testified in support of the resentencing. 
People who worked with the brothers in prison spoke about the educational courses they had completed, and described a hospice initiative they created for the elderly and sick.
The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes a lower sentence, said the brothers have continued to ""make excuses"" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility and were not rehabilitated. 
The brothers spoke to the court via video and apologised for their actions.
They also expressed their hope to work with sex abuse victims and help those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison.
Their future now lies with the California parole board, which has already set a hearing date to mull whether the brothers should be released. 
A hearing had initially been set for 13 June by Gov Gavin Newsom, who is examining a separate request to offer the brothers clemency - possibly in the form of a pardon.
That hearing has now been pushed to 21 and 22 August and it will examine the possibility of parole given their resentencing. 
Pop culture re-invented the Menendez brothers - now their fate may rest with one man
The governor had previously ordered that the board conduct a risk assessment, examining whether the brothers pose a risk to the general public if released. It's expected to be discussed and examined as part of the parole board hearing. 
The full report has not been released, but the district attorney said it indicated the brothers posed a ""moderate risk of violence"". 
The parole board is expected to offer a recommendation on their release but the governor will have the final say. 
Newsom, who is in the midst of a political transformation and might have his eyes set on a White House run, has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.
A jury found the brothers guilty of murder in 1996 
Lyle and Erik Menendez killed their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, on 20 August 1989 at their home in Beverly Hills. 
Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack.
Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body.
The brothers initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home.
They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor.
The brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court. 
They said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him. 
However, prosecutors argued that the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate. 
The brothers were taken into custody in 1990, and in 1993 they were tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother.
However, both juries were deadlocked in 1994, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together in 1995.
During their joint trial the judge excluded apparent evidence of abuse from their defence case. Taped sessions with a doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were ruled admissible in court by the judge.
A jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.
The brothers, who were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together, reunited in jail in 2018.
Cooper Koch (left) and Nicholas Chavez played Erik and Lyle Menendez respectively in the 2024 Netflix series 
The case was thrust back into the spotlight after Netflix released a drama series about the brothers in September 2024.  
Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, shot to the top of the platform's streaming chart and was reported to have had more than 12 million views in the first weekend after release alone. 
The programme explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents and presents the murders from different perspectives. 
Its creators said the series was based on extensive research. 
It includes the brothers' claims of abuse as well as showing things from the parents' point of view.
The show introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released.
The series was a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. 
Following its release, Erik Menendez shared a statement, released on X by his wife. 
He said the show was ""disheartening slander"" and he ""believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle"". 
""It is sad for me to know that Netflix's dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women,"" he added.
Members of the family also spoke out and said the brothers had been ""victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,"" and the show was ""riddled with mistruths"".
Ryan Murphy, who created the show, told Variety, external that the comments were ""predictable at best"".
He added that the family's response was ""interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It's not like we're making any of this stuff up. It's all been presented before""."

In a makeshift tent in al-Shati refugee camp, in the north of the Gaza Strip, 33-year-old Enas Abu Daqqa holds her tiny baby daughter Niveen in her arms. A fan hums constantly behind her to break the morning heat.
Enas worries that Niveen's health might deteriorate at any point. She is only seven months old, and was born during the war with a hole in her heart.
As her mother explains how she struggled to keep her alive amid a collapsing health system in Gaza, Niveen, with her big brown eyes and tiny frame, cries and fidgets.
""The war has been very tough for her,"" Enas tells the BBC. ""She wasn't gaining any weight, and she would get sick so easily.""
Niveen's only chance to survive was to receive urgent care outside Gaza. And in early March, Jordan made that possible.
As a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel held, 29 sick Gazan children, including Niveen, were evacuated to Jordan to receive treatment in the country's hospitals. Her mother and older sister were brought out with her.
They were the first children evacuated to Jordan after King Abdullah announced plans to treat 2,000 sick Gazan children in hospitals there during a visit to the US the previous month. These evacuations were co-ordinated with the Israeli authorities who do background checks on the parents travelling with their children.
Doctors in Jordan performed successful open-heart surgery on Niveen, and she was slowly beginning to recover.
But about two weeks into the children's treatment, the ceasefire in Gaza collapsed when Israel resumed its offensive against Hamas, and the war was back on, in full force.
For weeks, Enas followed the news from her daughter's hospital room in Jordan, worrying about the safety of her husband and other children who were still in Gaza.
And then late at night on 12 May, the Jordanian authorities told Enas they were sending her and her family back to Gaza the following day, as they said Niveen had completed her treatment.
Enas was shocked.
""We left while there was a ceasefire. How could they send us back after the war had restarted?"" she says, frustrated.
Niveen's mother worries about her health in one of the deadliest places to be a child
Enas is now reunited with her husband and children in Gaza. They say Niveen did not complete her treatment before she was sent back, and they worry that her condition could get worse.
""My daughter is in a very bad condition that could lead to her death,"" says Enas. ""She has heart disease. Sometimes she suffocates and turns blue. She can't continue living in a tent.""
On 13 May, Jordan announced that it had sent 17 children back to Gaza ""after completing their treatment"". And the next day, a new group of four sick children were evacuated from Gaza to Jordan.
The Jordanian authorities have told the BBC that all children sent back were in good medical condition, rejecting claims that they did not complete their treatment. 
The authorities noted that the kingdom was clear from the beginning about its intention to send the children back once they were better, adding that this was necessary ""for logistical and political reasons"".
""Jordan's policy is to keep Palestinians on their land, and not to contribute to their displacement outside their territory,"" a government statement sent to the BBC said. The return of the 17 children would also allow for more sick children to be evacuated from Gaza, it added.
But an official in the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza told the BBC the children still needed care, and that their return to the war endangered their lives.
This is exactly what worries 30-year-old Nihaya Bassel. 
Her son, Mohammed, who is just over a year old, suffers from asthma and serious food allergies. She believes her son did not receive the full treatment he deserved.
""We're back to living in fear and hunger, surrounded by death,"" Nihaya says as her eyes fill up with tears. ""How can I get this child the milk that he needs to drink? He doesn't eat even though he's just over a year old, because if he eats, he will immediately get sick.""
Israel imposed a strict siege on the Gaza Strip 11 weeks ago, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel. It said this and the resumed offensive were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages still held in Gaza. 
International organisations warn that Palestinians living there are at ""critical risk of famine"". On Monday, Israel announced it would allow a ""minimal"" amount of food into Gaza following US pressure. The UN welcomed the crossing of five lorries carrying aid including baby food, but called it ""a drop in the ocean"".
Nihaya says her son Mohammed cannot cope with the conditions in Gaza
Nihaya is now living in a small, tented area in al-Shati camp with her brother-in-law's family. Her husband and three other children had fled there from elsewhere in northern Gaza, escaping heavy Israeli strikes as the war restarted while she was in Jordan.
""I left my children here. I left my husband here. They went through hell while I was away,"" Nihaya says as she bursts into tears. 
""My mind and heart were constantly with them in Gaza while I was in Jordan. All of this so that my child could get treated. Why force me back before finishing his treatment?""
As she speaks, the sounds of Israeli surveillance drones drown out her voice. Her toddler runs around next to her, at times almost stumbling into a smoky open fire in the tent that the family uses for cooking meals.
She struggles to contain her anger as she recounts her journey back to Gaza.
""We didn't leave [till] 04:00, and didn't arrive in Gaza till 22:45,"" she says. As they reached the border crossing, Nihaya says they were harassed by Israeli security forces.
""They started cursing at us. They threatened to beat us. They took all our money. They took our mobile phones, our bags and everything,"" she says, noting that they confiscated all the bags of anyone who had cash on them.
Enas said the same thing happened to her, noting that her medical supplies were confiscated too.
The Israeli army told the BBC that they confiscated ""undeclared cash exceeding normal limits"" from Gazans returning from Jordan due to suspicions that they would be ""used for terrorism within Gaza"". It notes that the money is being held while circumstances are investigated.
It has not given a reason for why other personal belongings were confiscated.
Nihaya says she has come back from Jordan ""empty-handed""; even her son's medical records were in the bags that the Israeli security forces took away, she says.
Jordan says it has given children like Niveen and Mohammed the best healthcare it can offer, and both families acknowledge this. 
But they worry that a life in one of the world's deadliest war zones for children will just undo all the progress their children have made over the past two months.
""I got my son to a point where I was very happy to see him like that,"" Nihaya says through her tears. ""Now they want to bring him back to square one? I don't want my son to die.""

Flying home from his Gulf trip last week, President Donald Trump told reporters ""that was a great four days, historic four days"".
Visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), he added in this trademark swagger that ""the jobs and money coming into our countries, there has never been anything like it"".
Trump claimed that he was able to secure deals totalling more than $2tn (Â£1.5tn) for the US, but do the numbers add up?
The trip itself was an extravaganza, with the three Gulf states pulling out all the stops.
Escorts of fighter jets, extravagant welcoming ceremonies, a thundering 21-gun salute, a fleet of Tesla Cybertrucks, royal camels, Arabian horses, and sword dancers were all part of the pageantry.
The UAE also awarded Mr Trump the country's highest civilian honour, the Order of Zayed.
The visit's optics were striking; the region's richest petrostates flaunted their opulence, revealing just how much of that fortune they were ready to deploy to strengthen ties with the US while advancing their own economic goals.
Before embarking on the trip, President Trump, who touts himself as a ""dealmaker in chief"" was clear that the main objective of the trip was to land investments worth billions of dollars. On the face of it, he succeeded.
In Saudi Arabia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reiterated a pledge to invest $600bn in US-Saudi partnerships. There were a plethora of deals announced as part of this, encompassing arms, artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, infrastructure projects and science collaborations, and various security ties and initiatives.
The $142bn defence deal grabbed a lot of the attention as it was described by the White House as the largest arms deal ever.
However, there remains some doubt as to whether those investment figures are realistic.
During his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump had announced that Saudi Arabia had agreed to $450bn in deals with the US.
But actual trade and investment flows amounted to less than $300bn between 2017 to 2020, according to data compiled by the Arab Gulf States Institute.
The report was authored by Tim Callen, the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission chief to Saudi Arabia, and now a visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute.
""The proof with all of these [new] deals will be in the pudding,"" says Mr Callen.
The BBC contacted the White House for comment.

President Trump was given a welcome fit for royalty
In Qatar, Trump announced an ""economic exchange"" worth at least $1.2tn. However, in the fact sheet released by the White House deals worth only $243.5bn between the two countries were mentioned.
One of the Qatari agreements that was confirmed was Qatar Airways purchasing up to 210 passenger jets for $96bn from the beleaguered American aircraft manufacturer Boeing.
The White House said the deal would support 154,000 jobs in the US each year of their production, totalling one million jobs over the deal's lifecycle.
Meanwhile, the UAE inked an agreement to construct the world's largest AI campus outside the US, reportedly granting it access to 500,000 cutting edge microchips from US giant Nvidia, starting next year.
This project sits within the UAE's broader pledge to invest $1.4tn in the US over the next decade.
As well as the challenge of delivering what is promised, another potential obstacle to these figures being realised are oil prices.
Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low in April amid growing concerns that Trump's tariffs could dampen global economic growth. The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.
For Saudi Arabia, the fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained its finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.
Last month, the IMF cut the forecast for the world's largest oil exporter's GDP growth in 2025 to 3% from its previous estimate of 3.3%.
""It's going to be very hard for Saudi to come up with that sort of money [the $600bn announced] in the current oil price environment,"" Mr Callen adds.
Other analysts note that a lot of the agreements signed during the trip were non-binding memorandums of understanding, which are less formal than contracts, and do not always translate into actual transactions. And some of the deals included in the agreement were announced earlier.
Saudi oil firm Aramco, for instance, announced 34 agreements with US companies valued at up to $90bn. However, most were non-binding memorandums of understanding without specified monetary commitments.
And its agreement to purchase 1.2 million tonnes of liquified natural gas annually for 20 years from US firm NextDecade was also included in the list of new deals, despite it first being announced months ago.
One of the deals announced on the trip was Qatar Airways buying 210 new aircraft from Boeing
Yet the massive investments mark a continuation of the shift in the US-Gulf relationship away from oil-for-security to stronger economic partnerships rooted in bilateral investments.
Bader Al Saif, an assistant professor at Kuwait University and an associate fellow at think tank Chatham House, says that the deals indicate that US and the Gulf states are ""planning the future together and that was a significant change for the relationship"".
He adds that the AI deals with the UAE and Saudi Arabia were central to this as ""they clearly demonstrate that they are trying to see how to build the new global order and the new way of doing things together"".
This emphasis on AI underscores the growing strategic importance of the technology to US diplomacy. Trump was accompanied on the trip by Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Elon Musk, who owns Grok AI.
And on the eve of the visit, the White House scrapped tough Biden-era restrictions on exports of the advanced US semiconductors required to best run AI systems. The rules had divided the world into tiers, with some countries enjoying broad access to its high-end chips, and others being denied them altogether.
About 120 countries, including the Gulf nations, were grouped in the middle, facing strict caps on the number of semiconductors they could import. This had frustrated countries such as Saudi Arabia, who have ambitions to become high-tech economies as they transition away from oil.
Both Saudi and the UAE are racing to build large-scale AI data centres, while Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital, aims to become a global AI hub.
The UAE has made visible efforts to reassure Washington â deepening partnerships with US tech firms, curbing ties with Chinese companies, and aligning more closely with American national security interests.
Mr Al-Saif says that the UAE is ""betting on the Americans when it comes to AI"". ""We have seen that the technological turn in the 90s came from the US anyway.""
After Saudi Arabia Trump travelled to Qatar where $1.2tn of deals were announced
Both camps are hailing the visit as a triumph. For the Gulf, and especially Saudi Arabia, it resets a partnership that frayed under Biden, and underscores their ambition to act as heavyweight players on the world stage.
For Trump, touting ""trillions"" in new investment offers a timely boost - his tariff hikes have dented global trade and pushed US output into its first quarterly dip in three years.
These Gulf deals will be sold as proof that his economic playbook is working.
At the end of the trip, Mr Trump worried that whoever succeeds him in the White House would claim credit for the deals once they come to completion.
""I'll be sitting home, who the hell knows where I'll be, and I'll say, 'I did that,'"" he said.
""Somebody's going to be taking the credit for this. You remember, press,"" he said, pointing to himself, ""this guy did it."""

Alina Habba - the interim US attorney for the state and a former personal attorney to President Donald Trump - initially announced the charges in a social media post late on Monday.
Habba also said that her office would drop a trespassing case against the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who is also a Democrat.
Scuffles broke out when McIver, Baraka and others paid an oversight visit to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) centre in Newark on 9 May. No injuries were reported.
The Democratic lawmakers were visiting Delaney Hall, which can hold up to 1,000 people and was touted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the first reopened immigration facility under the new Trump administration.
Videos showed increasingly heated discussion and a chaotic scene including police, Ice agents, journalists, the politicians and protesters before Mayor Baraka was arrested.
The formal complaint, unsealed on Tuesday, alleges that McIver pushed Ice agents with her forearms and joined in efforts to prevent them from arresting Mayor Baraka. 
The eight-page document includes several screenshots from cameras worn by Ice officers that show McIver, in a bright red jacket, inside a crowd of politicians and law enforcement.
She is charged with two counts of assaulting, resisting, and impeding certain officers or employees.
Federal law prohibits immigration officials from blocking access to detention facilities for members of Congress seeking to conduct oversight, and grants lawmakers and designated staffers special access.
The members of Congress present on 9 May were eventually granted access and given a tour of the building.
It is unusual for US attorneys to charge sitting members of Congress, though not unprecedented. 
Individual lawmakers have in the past faced charges on fraud, bribery, and campaign finance violations.
Members of Congress are occasionally arrested at protests, but those incidents are primarily symbolic and rarely lead to criminal charges.
Charging a member of Congress requires consultation or approval Department of Justice's public integrity section in Washington DC. 
That oversight exists to ""avoid compromising the credibility and the public perception of the justice department, and how especially political or politically sensitive prosecutions are handled"", said John Keller. 
Mr Keller resigned from the unit in February after the department moved to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams - one of several high profile departures since Trump took office. 
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a BBC inquiry about whether the protocols set out by the agency had come into play in McIver's case.
Matt Platkin, the New Jersey attorney general and the state's highest-ranking law enforcement official, called the charges against McIver ""an extraordinary step that requires clear evidence of criminal conduct and intent"".
Administration officials and the Democratic lawmakers opposed to the Ice facility each blamed each other for the incident.
Commenting on the case, Trump told reporters that McIver had been ""out of control"", and DHS said the politicians ""stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility.""
Tom Homan, the administration's border czar, told reporters that there was a ""right way and a wrong way"" for lawmakers to check on the state of detention facilities.
McIver has denied wrongdoing and maintained she was ""fulfilling our lawful oversight responsibilities.""
She called the case against her ""purely political"", while leading congressional Democrats issued a statement saying the charge of assaulting, impeding or interfering with law enforcement ""is extreme, morally bankrupt and lacks any basis in law or fact"".
Baraka said the videos taken during the incident ""make it clear that Delaney Hall personnel opened the gate for me, and allowed me to enter the property, as well as my calm and respectful departure when asked to leave"".
In dropping the charge against the mayor, Habba, who went on to serve as a spokeswoman for Trump before he named her the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, said she would personally give Baraka a tour of the facility.

In a statement on Sunday, Biden's office said the 82-year-old had received the diagnosis on Friday after seeing a doctor for urinary symptoms.
Some doctors have expressed surprise that the aggressive form of cancer, which has spread to his bones, was not detected earlier. 
Others pointed out that cancers can grow fast without the patient displaying symptoms - and that men over 70 are not routinely screened.
President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday his predecessor should have been more transparent with the public, seeming to imply that the cancer diagnosis had been covered up - a suggestion rejected by a Biden aide.

""I think it is very sad actually. I am surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago,"" Trump said at an event at the White House.
""It could take years to get to this level of danger. So, look, it's a very, very sad situation. I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened.""
A Biden aide said the former president's prior medical check for prostate cancer was more than a decade ago.
He had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test in 2014, the aide told reporters on Tuesday.
""Prior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer,"" the aide added.
The cancer diagnosis comes amid reports that the Democrat's aides sought to conceal other deteriorating health conditions from the public ahead of the 2024 election.
Cancer touches us all, says Biden after outpouring
What we know about Biden's cancer
Republicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. He dropped out of the race last summer after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.
According to Original Sin, a new book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Biden was unable to recognise Hollywood actor and Democratic donor George Clooney or to recall the names of key aides in his final year in office.
The authors write: ""Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.""
The publicity generated by the book has forced senior Democrats to field questions on why they did not do more to respond to Americans' concerns about Biden's health as he campaigned for re-election.
""It was a mistake for Democrats to not listen to the voters earlier,"" Senator Chris Murphy said on Sunday.
After the news of Biden's diagnosis, Vice-President JD Vance wished him well, but asked whether Biden's doctors or staff members had sought to keep the public from knowing about the true state of his health.
""This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,"" he added.
Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist who worked as a Covid adviser to the Biden White House, was among those claiming that Biden probably had been ill with cancer for some time, without necessarily knowing it.
""He did not develop in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president,"" he told MSNBC's Morning Joe show. ""He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021. Yes, I don't think there's any disagreement about that.""
US medical guidelines do not recommend routine blood screenings for men over 70 because prostate cancers can be very slow-growing, and the difficulty of testing and treatment may outweigh the risk from the cancer.
Biden had previously been diagnosed with benign enlargement of the prostate. In 2019, before he was elected, his campaign released the report from his medical screening, saying he had been treated with medication and surgery, ""and has never had prostate cancer"".
That's led to questions about whether Biden was tested at any point during his four-year presidency - and why the diagnosis came so late.
""I would assume the former president gets a very thorough physical every year,"" Dr Chris George of the Northwestern Health Network told Reuters. ""It's sort of hard for me to believe that he's had a (blood test) within the past year that was normal.""
However, Dr Robert Figlin, interim director of Cedars-Sinai Cancer, told the BBC that the aggressive way Biden's cancer had presented was not that unusual. And he warned critics against ""assuming that somehow something was missed along the way"".
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer for men, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), out of every 100 American men, 13 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, and two or three men will die from it."

At just 37 hectares, the Philippines-controlled island of Pagasa â or ""hope"" â is barely big enough to live on. There is almost nothing there.
The 300 or so inhabitants live in a cluster of small, wooden houses. They fish in the clear, turquoise waters, and grow what vegetables they can in the sandy ground.
But they are not alone in these disputed waters: just off shore, to the west, lies an armada of ships.
These are all Chinese, from the navy, the coastguard or the so-called maritime militia â large fishing vessels repurposed to maintain Chinese dominance of this sea. As our plane approached the island we counted at least 20.
For the past 10 years, China has been expanding its presence in the South China Sea, taking over submerged coral reefs, building three large air bases on them, and deploying hundreds of ships, to reinforce its claim to almost all of the strategic sea lanes running south from the great exporting cities on the Chinese coast.
Few of the South East Asian countries which also claim islands in the same sea have dared to push back against China; only Vietnam and the Philippines have done so. The militaries of both countries are much smaller than China's, but they are holding on to a handful of reefs and islands.
Pagasa â also known as Thitu and other names, as it is claimed by several other countries â is the largest of these.
Chinese ships are a permanent intimidating presence to the people of Pagasa
What makes it exceptional, though, is the civilian population, found on few islands in the South China Sea. From the point of view of the Philippines this, and the fact that Pagasa is solid land, not a partially submerged reef or sandy cay, strengthens its legal claims in the area.
""Pagasa is very important to us,"" Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the Philippines National Security Council, tells the BBC.
""It has a runway. It can support life â it has a resident Filipino community, and fishermen living there.
""And given the size of the island, one of the few that did not need reclaiming from the sea, under international law it generates its own territorial sea of 12 nautical miles.
""So it is, in a way, a linchpin for the Philippine presence.""
Reaching Pagasa is a two-to-three-day boat ride from the Philippines island of Palawan, or a one-hour plane ride, but both are at the mercy of frequent stormy weather.
Until they surfaced the runway two years ago, and lengthened it to 1,300m (4,600ft), only small planes could land. Now they can bring in big C130 transport aircraft. Travelling in them, as we did, is a bit like riding a bus in rush hour.
Everything has to be brought from the mainland, which is why our plane was packed, floor to ceiling, with mattresses, eggs, bags of rice, a couple of motorbikes and piles of luggage â not to mention lots of military personnel, most of whom had to stand for the entire flight.
All supplies have to be brought in from the mainland including motorbikes
A lot has changed in recent years. There is a new hangar, big enough to shelter aircraft during storms. They are building a control tower and dredging a small harbour to allow bigger boats to dock. We were driven around the island by some of the Philippines marines who are stationed there, though given its size it hardly seemed necessary
The Philippines seized Pagasa from Taiwan in 1971, when the Taiwanese garrison left it during a typhoon. It was formally annexed by the Philippines in 1978.
Later, the government started encouraging civilians to settle there. But they need support to survive on this remote sliver of land. Families get official donations of food, water and other groceries every month. They now have electricity and mobile phone connectivity, but that only came four years ago.
Aside from government jobs, fishing is the only viable way to make a living, and since the arrival of the Chinese flotillas even that has become difficult.
Fisherman Larry Hugo has lived on the island for 16 years, and has chronicled the increasing Chinese control of the area. He filmed the initial construction on Subi Reef, around 32km (20 miles) from Pagasa, which eventually became a full-size military air base. One of his videos, showing his little wooden boat being nearly rammed by a Chinese coastguard ship in 2021 made him a minor celebrity.
The island of Pagasa is home to some 300 people
But Chinese harassment has forced him to fish in a smaller area closer to home.
""Their ships are huge compared to ours. They threaten us, coming close and sounding their horns to chase us away. They really scare us. So I no longer go to my old fishing grounds further away. I now have to fish close to the island, but the fish stocks here are falling, and it is much harder to fill our tubs like we used to.""
Realyn Limbo has been a teacher on the island for 10 years, and seen the school grow from a small hut to full-size school teaching more than 100 pupils, from kindergarten to 18 years old.
""To me this island is like paradise,"" she says. ""All our basic needs are taken care of. It is clean and peaceful â the children can play basketball or go swimming after school. We don't need shopping malls or all that materialism.""
Pagasa is really quiet. In the fierce midday heat we found most people snoozing in hammocks, or playing music on their porches. We came across Melania Alojado, a village health worker, rocking a small baby  to help it sleep.
""The biggest challenge for us is when people, especially children, fall ill,"" she says. 
""If it is serious then we need to evacuate them to the mainland. I am not a registered nurse, so I cannot perform complicated medical tasks. But planes are not always available, and sometimes the weather is too rough to travel.
""When that happens we just have to care for them as best we can.""
Pagasa has both a sleepy charm and the feel of a garrison community
But she too values the tranquillity of island life. ""We are free of many stresses. We get subsidised food, and we can grow some of our own. In the big city everything you do needs money.""
We saw a few new houses being built, but there really isn't room for Pagasa to accommodate many more people. With very few jobs, young people usually leave the island once they finish school. For all of its sleepy charm, and stunning white-sand beaches, it has the feel of a garrison community, holding the line against the overpowering Chinese presence which is clearly visible just offshore.
""The Chinese at the airbase on Subi Reef always challenge us when we approach Pagasa,"" the pilot says. ""They always warn us we are entering Chinese territory without permission.""
Do they ever try to stop you? ""No, it's a routine. We tell them this is Philippines territory. We do this every time.""
Jonathan Malaya says his government has made a formal diplomatic protest every week to the Chinese Embassy over the presence of its ships in what the Philippines views as the territorial waters of Pagasa. This is in marked contrast to the previous administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, which avoided confrontations with China in the hope of getting more investment in the Philippines.
""I think we will get more respect from China if we hold our ground, and show them we can play this game as well. But the problem of democracies like the Philippines is policies can change with new administrations. China does not have that problem."""

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for Syria's transitional authorities to be supported, warning that the country could be only weeks away from ""potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions"".
At a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he defended President Donald Trump's decision last week to lift sanctions on Syria before meeting President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander who led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December.
Trump's rationale was that other countries wanted to help Sharaa's administration and send aid but were afraid of the sanctions, Rubio explained.
There was no immediate comment from Syrian officials.
The US imposed sanctions on Syria in response to atrocities committed by forces loyal to Assad during the country's devastating 13-year civil war, in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others were forced from their homes.
The State Department had previously insisted on several conditions being met before they were lifted, including protecting religious and ethnic minorities.
Although Sharaa has promised to do that, the country has been rocked by two waves of deadly sectarian violence in recent months.
In March, almost 900 civilians, mainly members of Assad's Alawite sect, were killed by pro-government forces across the western coastal region during fighting between security forces and former regime loyalists, according to one monitoring group. The loyalists reportedly killed almost 450 civilians and 170 security personnel.
And at the start of May, more than 100 people were reportedly killed in clashes between gunmen from the Druze religious minority, the new security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters in two suburbs of the capital Damascus and the southern province of Suweida.
Even before the violence, many members of minority communities were worried about the new transitional authorities, which are dominated by Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It is a former al-Qaeda affiliate still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.
Sharaa himself also continues to be listed by the US as a ""specially designated global terrorist"", although the Biden administration announced in December that the US would scrap the $10m (Â£7.5m) bounty offered for his arrest.
Ahmed al-Sharaa shook hands with Donald Trump during a meeting in Riyadh hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
Despite Sharaa's past, Trump took the opportunity to meet him while attending a summit of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia last week.
Afterwards, the US president told reporters that he was a ""young, attractive guy"", adding: ""Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.""
""He's got a real shot at pulling it [Syria] together,"" he said, adding, ""it's a torn-up country"".
Sharaa meanwhile said Trump's decision to lift the sanctions on Syria ""was a historic and courageous decision, which alleviates the suffering of the people, contributes to their rebirth and lays the foundations for stability in the region"".
Speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in Washington DC on Tuesday, Rubio quipped that ""the bad news is that the transitional authority figures... didn't pass their background check with the FBI"".
""But on the flip side of it is, if we engage them, it may work out, it may not work out. If we did not engage them it was guaranteed to not work out,"" he added.
""In fact, it is our assessment that, frankly, the transitional authority, given the challenges they're facing, are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.""
He did not elaborate but said Syria's minorities were ""dealing with deep internal distrust... because Assad deliberately pitted these groups against each other"".
He said the Trump administration decided to lift the sanctions quickly because ""nations in the region want to get aid in, want to start helping them. And they can't because they are afraid of our sanctions"".
As Rubio spoke, European Union foreign ministers agreed to also lift economic sanctions on Syria.
""We want to help the Syrian people rebuild a new, inclusive and peaceful Syria,"" the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X.
""The EU has always stood by Syrians throughout the last 14 years - and will keep doing so.""
The Syrian foreign ministry said the decision marked ""the beginning of a new chapter in Syrian-European relations built on shared prosperity and mutual respect""."

After more than a year and a half of the war in Gaza, Britain appears to have finally lost patience with Israel.
Speaking to MPs, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary David Lammy sounded genuinely angry.
Sir Keir said the level of suffering in Gaza, especially among innocent children, was ""intolerable"".
Israel's decision to allow in a small amount of aid was, he said, ""utterly inadequate"".
The prime minister added he was ""horrified"" by Israel's decision to escalate its military campaign.
Lammy employed similar language, saying the situation in Gaza was ""abominable"".
He condemned as ""monstrous"" the suggestion by Israel's hardline finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, that Gaza should be cleansed of its civilian population.
Israel's actions, Lammy said, were isolating Israel from friends and partners around the world and ""damaging the image of the State of Israel in the eyes of the world"".
UK steps up action against Israel over Gaza offensive
Goodwill running out for Israel among allies
UN says no aid yet distributed in Gaza
Nor is Britain alone in expressions of outrage or threats of concrete action.
The EU says it's reviewing its association agreement with Israel, which governs its political and economic relationship.
Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said a ""strong majority"" of members favoured looking again at the 25-year-old agreement.
On Monday night, Britain joined France and Canada in signing a strongly worded joint statement, condemning Israel's military action and warning of ""further concrete actions"" if the humanitarian situation in Gaza did not approve.
Another statement followed, signed by 27 donor countries including the UK, condemning a new Gaza aid delivery model being promoted by Israel.
The model aims to replace existing humanitarian agencies, including the UN, with civilian contractors, backed by the Israeli military.
The UN and its donors say the new model is poorly conceived and politically motivated, incapable of replacing the decades-long tried and tested international humanitarian ecosystem in Gaza.
A representative of one of the aid agencies operating in Gaza told me the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme was ""totally premature,"" adding that Israel had never provided evidence to back up its assertion that Hamas was responsible for the widespread diversion of aid.
One western diplomat, quoted in Israel's liberal Haaretz newspaper, described the new model as a ""crazy plan and absolute madness"".
During a passionate debate in the House of Commons, Lammy clashed with his Conservative opposite number, Dame Priti Patel, who suggested Hamas was benefitting from international criticism of Israel.
Lammy accused her of refusing to confront the reality of what was happening in Gaza.
Other MPs said Britain wasn't going far enough, with several suggesting, once again, that the time has come for Britain to recognise a Palestinian state.
The government's view is that taking such a significant step for purely symbolic reasons wouldn't actually change anything.
But with France possibly poised to recognise Palestine at a conference it's co-hosting with Saudi Arabia next month, some are hoping Britain follows suit.
Even if it doesn't, it's clear that Israel's supporters are increasingly exasperated, and fearful that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's latest military operation, dubbed ""Gideon's Chariots"" is poised to heap misery on Gaza just as the area's two million civilians face the very real prospect of starvation.
Even US President Donald Trump has expressed impatience, warning that ""a lot of people are starving"" as he concluded his regional tour last week.
Netanyahu's government is losing support, even among some of Israel's staunchest allies.
At a World Jewish Congress conference in Jerusalem, the organisation's president Ronald Lauder challenged Israel's foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar.
""All the best things Israel does are being destroyed by Smotrich because his statement about starving the Gazans and causing destruction is broadcast all over the world,"" Lauder said, asking why Netanyahu does nothing to stop him.
According to veteran Israeli journalist Ben Caspit, Sa'ar's answer was brief.

Trump departed the comfortable confines of the White House for a far more raucous setting - Capitol Hill - where he tried to rally squabbling factions within his party to back his ""big, beautiful"" bill.
Some members are at odds over changes to healthcare and tax deductions in the bill, which also includes about $4.9tr (â¬3.7tn) in tax breaks.
Trump, who wants it passed by 26 May, is amping up pressure on Republicans to support it. Some conservative hardliners pushing for deeper cuts are meeting fierce resistance from moderates.
It was obvious something big was happening on Capitol Hill from blocks away, as lines to get into different congressional buildings wrapped around blocks.
That, coupled with scurrying Secret Service agents lining the halls were just some of the signs of a distinguished guest: Trump.
While Trump's pitch earned him the support of some House Republicans, not all left the meeting enthused and ready to support the bill.
The measure still needs to pass a full House vote before it heads to the Senate, where Republicans there have their own qualms with the legislation.
Trump downplayed dissent from some conservatives when he spoke to reporters after meeting House Republicans.
""This was a meeting of love, there was great unity in that room,"" Trump said. ""We're going to have a great victory.""
Others in his party weren't so emphatic. ""As it stands right now, I do not support the bill,"" said Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. 
The president has emphasised that the bill gets rid of the ""waste fraud and abuse"" included in the budget, but not all Republican members agreed on what that means.
House Speaker Mike Johnson wants the budget bill passed by Memorial Day, which is 26 May
Much of the division in the party centres on changes to state and local tax deductions - known as Salt. The bill proposes to triple the allowable deduction from from $10,000 to $30,000 for couples.
That's irked Republicans in states with higher taxes, such as New York, California and New Jersey, who are pushing for a higher cap. Lawmakers in those states argue a higher cap will give relief for middle-class Americans in high-taxed jurisdictions.
Mike Lawler appeared frustrated, saying he wouldn't back the measure in the upcoming full house vote.
""While I respect the president, I'm not budging on it,"" Lawler said.
About a half a dozen members are similarly standing firm, threatening to hold out support.
Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis, a New York Republican who previously expressed some scepticism about the Salt proposals, said she is satisfied with how the issue has been resolved but does not blame other representatives for pushing back.
""They're fighting for their districts and they should be but when it comes time to vote for the bill, it's get the best deal possible and vote for the bill"" Malliotakis said.
EXPLAINER: Four sticking points in Trump's 'big, beautiful' tax bill
Trump mega-bill takes one step closer to House vote
Beyond the Salt dissenters, Republicans in both legislative chambers remain divided on perhaps the most contentious element of the bill - cuts to the healthcare program designed to assist lower-income Americans.
Some support tightening eligibility requirements for Medicaid, while others fear the proposal goes too far.
The bill currently would require that states deny Medicaid coverage, which is offered for free or a very low-cost, if able-bodied Americans using the programme are not working at least 80 hours a month or undertaking other community options - from 2029, after Trump has left office.
In private meetings with Republicans, Trump reportedly sought to ease concerns that his planned cuts were too deep. 
Congressman Jodey Arrington, chair of the budget committee, said members found Trump's pitch convincing.
""His push to unify, keep the focus on reducing spending, on rooting out waste and reminding us what's at stake was exactly the right message, and the right tone,"" Arrington said.
However, that view wasn't universal.
""The president I don't think convinced enough people that the bill is adequate the way it is,"" said Republican Representative Andy Harris, who leads the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. He's among Republicans pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid.
Last week, the legislation failed to pass a key a procedural committee vote, giving Trump his first legislative bruise of his second term.
On Sunday, days after the first vote failed, the bill cleared its first hurdle and passed the committee in a 17-16 vote.
Trump is now lobbying Republicans as the bill heads for a full House vote where his party has a narrow majority and cannot afford to lose support.
A full House vote is expected on Wednesday or Thursday."

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) group, which has been engaged in a two-year war with Sudan's army, has been entirely pushed out of Khartoum state, says the military.
""Khartoum State is completely free of rebels"", the army said in a statement published by Sudan's News Agency. 
The announcement comes nearly two months after the military recaptured Khartoum city - including the presidential palace - from its rivals in a major victory.
Earlier on Tuesday, fighting had broken out between the warring groups in the city of Omdurman - which is also in Khartoum state and part of the capital region. 
The army said on Monday that it had started a ""large-scale offensive"" in Omdurman, according to the AFP news agency. 
The RSF has not yet commented on the army's latest claim.
Khartoum had once been at the heart of Sudan's government, but the country's military leaders were forced to move east to Port Sudan after their rivals took control of the area.
Until recently Port Sudan had been viewed as relatively safe, however it was at the centre of escalating fighting when it came under drone attack earlier this month, which the army blamed on the RSF. 
The attacks hit key infrastructure and led to water shortages and worsening blackouts.
The war has also had diplomatic reverberations, with relations souring between Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), after Sudan accused the gulf nation of supporting the RSF, which it denies. 
Those accusations continued on Tuesday, with Sudan saying the UAE was responsible for an attack on Port Sudan earlier this month, Reuters news agency reported.
The UAE has strongly denied the accusations, describing them as ""unfounded allegations"".
Since the civil war erupted more than two years ago, thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced from their homes - creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis. 
Both the army and the RSF have been accused of war crimes, which they deny.

The new tax would mean that packages worth less than 150 euros (Â£126) are no longer customs-free. 
Online marketplaces, including Chinese giants Temu and Shein, would be expected to pay the fee, said EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic.
Last year, 4.6 billion such parcels entered the EU, with more than 90% coming from China.
Such a volume had created a huge workload for EU customs staff, Sefcovic said. He argued it had presented challenges in ensuring the safety and standard of goods entering the bloc was properly checked. 
The proposed fee would ""compensate the cost"", he told the European Parliament. Brussels also hopes some of the revenue generated will go towards the EU budget.
The two-euro fee will apply to packages sent directly to consumers, while parcels sent to warehouses would be taxed at a lower rate of 0.50 euros (Â£0.42). 
The EU's move comes after the US's new tariffs on Chinese goods under President Donald Trump's administration - which include a fee on small packages. 
Following negotiations last week, the tariff on small packages worth up to $800 (Â£606) was revised down to 54% from 120%. However a flat fee per parcel of $100 remains.
There had been fears that the Chinese e-commerce giants could then flood the European market with cheap goods, as products originally destined for the US would have to be dumped elsewhere.
European retailers have complained before that they face unfair competition with overseas competitors, who they argue do not comply with the EU's strict product standards.
Shein and Temu have previously said they would co-operate with regulators and consumer standards. Temu says it has 92 million users in the EU, while Shein has said it has over 130 million.
Prior to the US tariffs, platforms like Shein and Temu had relied on the so-called ""de minimis"" exemption to ship low-value items directly to customers in the US without having to pay duties or import taxes."

Italy has backed President Donald Trump's suggestion the Vatican might mediate talks on negotiating a ceasefire in Ukraine, while he appears keen to step back from the process himself.
Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said Italy was ready to ""facilitate contacts and work towards peace"" in Ukraine and it ""viewed positively"" what it said was the Pope's willingness to host the talks at the Vatican.
In fact there's no firm agreement yet on further discussions: last Friday's meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul brought additional demands from Moscow, not progress.
Pope Leo said last week the Vatican was ""always ready"" to bring enemies together and he would ""make every effort"" for peace to prevail.
But the Holy See says the idea of hosting, or even mediating, talks â which Trump suggested was an option - is more a hope for now than any concrete plan.
Giorgia Meloni has reacted warmly to US proposals for the Vatican to host peace talks
If direct engagement does continue, Ukraine seems open to the notion of the Vatican as host.
Volodymyr Zelensky posted on X on Tuesday that he had talked to Giorgia Meloni, including about ""possible platforms for talks with the Russians"".
The Italian prime minister had, he said, ""as always, cool ideas"", although he has raised Turkey and Switzerland as alternative venues too.
The Kremlin might prefer to stay in Turkey. It talks about a process called ""Istanbul Plus"", styling any talks as a follow-up on the deal initially discussed in Turkey shortly after the full-scale invasion.
Those terms, which included Ukraine drastically reducing its own military, would represent capitulation for Kyiv now.
But Russia has added more: the ""plus"" part means recognition of its annexation of four partially occupied regions of Ukraine as well as Crimea.
The actual venue matters little to the Kremlin: all it wants is for the discussion to be on Vladimir Putin's terms.
The prospect of meaningful progress, bluntly, looks slim.
But might the Vatican lend some extra moral authority in the push for some kind of compromise?
The Catholic Church has a history of helping to mediate conflicts and it has already been involved in talks to free prisoners and return Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.
Its real input there isn't clear, though, as others have fulfilled the same role.
On the other hand, the Vatican â especially any involvement of the new Pope â would introduce a different tone to proceedings.
Its quiet style couldn't be further from Donald Trump's capitalised social media posts and his brutal public showdown with Zelensky in the Oval Office. And the setting already seems to have worked wonders on the men's relationship.
It was at Pope Francis' funeral that they were snapped deep in conversation, heads close, inside St Peter's Basilica.
The Vatican prides itself on its diplomacy: that's why, when others severed ties with Moscow after it began bombing Ukraine, the Catholic Church sent a cardinal envoy to talk to the Kremlin. It made no impact.
President Trump held impromptu talks with Ukraine's leader at Pope Francis' funeral at St Peter's Basilica 
Pope Francis, like Donald Trump, always avoided openly identifying Russia as the aggressor. Vatican sources say that was to keep the door for dialogue ajar, even when it seemed hopeless.
But Francis upset Ukrainians more by suggesting that Russia had been ""provoked"" by Nato into its invasion. He then agreed it might be wise for Kyiv to ""raise the white flag"" and surrender.
For Kyiv, Pope Leo might be a preferable potential peace-broker. He is on record as bishop denouncing Russia's invasion as an imperialist war and condemning crimes against humanity being committed by Putin's troops.
That's unlikely to faze the Kremlin, if the Vatican were ever to host talks.
""Putin can explain his position to the Pope, he believes it's just. In his mind, it's Ukraine that's not serious about peace talks,"" argued Tatiana Stanovaya, from the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.
""I don't believe for one second that the Pope could affect Putin's understanding in any way.""
At this point, Russia is under no major pressure to give ground: all Donald Trump's talk of punishing Putin for his intransigence has turned into talk of trade with Russia. Offering incentives, not threating sanctions.
It's true that Moscow wanted a lot more.
""They want Zelensky removed and for the US and EU to stop military aid, but on this, the US has been on Ukraine's side â from the Russian perspective,"" Tatiana Stanovaya says.
So Russia is prepared to play the long game - which doesn't involve compromise.
""If the Pope could help pressure Ukraine, Putin wouldn't have a problem [with his involvement],"" she says.
That seems to be the real issue here. It runs far deeper than whether the two sides eat meze or antipasti between hypothetical rounds of fresh talks."

This story contains distressing details from the start
Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon on trial in France who has admitted to sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly under age, said he considers himself ""responsible"" for the death of two of his victims.
Over the last few weeks, the court was shown the photos of two people whose relatives say died by suicide, following the trauma of being sexually assaulted by Le Scouarnec when they were children.
One is not being named; the other is Mathias Vinet, who died at in 2021 after struggling with addiction. His grandparents told the BBC they blame Le Scouarnec for his death.
""I keep the memory of those two photos, [shown] right towards the end, during the last examinations,"" the former surgeon said. ""They died, and I am responsible.""
Le Scouarnec, 74, was being questioned in court in Vannes, Brittany, during the penultimate week of a long and gruelling trial which began in late February.
In March, during a session held behind closed doors, Le Scouarnec - once a respected small-town surgeon - admitted to sexually abusing all 299 victims, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations, between 1989 and 2014. More than 250 of them were under the age of 15.
His lawyer Maxime Tessier said he had asked Le Scouarnec if he admitted that the numerous people mentioned in his diaries were ""all potential victims of his acts and he said: 'Yes'"".
At the start of the trial Le Scouarnec also told the court he ""committed despicable acts"" and ""understood and shared the suffering"" caused to many of his patients.
Police were able to identify hundreds of victims thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec logged assaults he carried out in graphic detail.
Many had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.
For hundreds of hours over the course of the trial, Le Scouarnec has come face to face with dozens of his victims and their relatives.
Many of them became emotional as they described how the abuse they endured shaped their lives; several said they have suffered from eating disorders, anxiety, depression or addiction.
""You got into my head, it's destroyed me, I became a whole other person I don't recognise anymore,"" Le Monde newspaper reported one victim as saying.
One of the few victims who had memories of the abuse sustained at the hands of Le Scouarnec said that she was relieved when police contacted her to say her name appeared in the former surgeon's diaries.
""I have been waiting for your call for 30 years,"" she said, according to Le Monde.
The newspaper also told the story of another victim who had no recollection of the abuse but said she nonetheless was ""convinced"" she had been raped. ""I wanted to die without even knowing why. He stole my youth,"" she told the court.
Throughout the trial Le Scouarnec has apologised to his victims, often acknowledging that his acts had been ""revolting"".
Romane Codou, a lawyer representing several victims, told French media that his admission of guilt had ""appeased"" the victims and ""allowed them to shut the door on an awful debate in which we were at the mercy of Joel Le Scouarnec"".
A section of the trial was devoted to the cross-examination of medical professionals who worked in the same establishments as Le Scouarnec.
Victims' lawyers and child protection advocacy groups have said ""institutional failings"" allowed the surgeon to continue working with children even after an FBI alert - issued in the early 2000s - warned French authorities that Le Scouarnec had been accessing child abuse websites.
The National Order of Doctors (Cnom), which has also filed a lawsuit against Le Scouranec, said in March that it ""expressed its deep regrets"" as he should have been ""prevented from practicing"".
""This situation has highlighted poor communication between the different entities of the Order of Doctors, and we deeply regret this,"" they said in a statement.
Despite being the largest child abuse trial in French history, many victims have felt the proceedings have garnered relatively little attention in France.
The Victims of Joel Le Scouarnec Collective group said it was ""stunned"" to see how the trial had failed to capture the attention of politicians and society at large.
""No lesson has been drawn from this, neither from the medical world nor from politicians,"" the group said in a statement.
Le Scouarnec is already in prison after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces. Now, he faces an additional 20-year sentence.
A verdict is expected on 28 May."

A college at a leading university has said it will no longer invest in arms companies following a number of student protests. 
King's College, part of the University of Cambridge, said its governing body had voted to ""adopt a new responsible investment policy"" to align with the values of its community.
It comes after pro-Palestine protesters staged demonstrations and set up encampments against the war in Gaza at the university last year.
Stella Swain, youth and student officer at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said it was a ""massive victory"". 
In June 2024 paint was sprayed on Senate House, in the centre of Cambridge
Student-led group Cambridge for Palestine has called on the university to divest from companies ""complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine"".
King's College's new financial investments will exclude companies that are involved in activities ""generally recognised as illegal or contravening global norms, such as occupation"", it said. 
It will also exclude companies which produce military and nuclear weapons, weapons restricted by international treaty, or companies that produce key or dedicated components of such weapons.
The policy builds on discussions about the relationship between the college's investments and its values, which were ""prompted by the occupation of Ukraine and Palestinian territories"".
Gillian Tett, provost of King's College, said: ""This is a positive result from a process that engaged voices from all areas of our community.
""I commend the members of the working group for their incredibly thoughtful engagement and deep commitment to work towards an approach that reflects the college's values and demonstrates our capacity to model transformation.""
The college said the changes could be in place by the end of the year. 
Ms Swain said: ""This is a massive victory, and speaks to the incredible power and commitment of student campaigning, at King's College and across the country.
""If King's College, at the heart of Cambridge, can finally listen to its students and divest from the arms industry and companies complicit in the illegal occupation of Palestine, then every university can act to ensure they are on the right side of history.""

A family of Italian burglars who stole luxury goods worth more than Â£1.2m from homes including that of Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak have been jailed.
Brothers Valentino and Giacomo Nikolov, their sister Jela Jovanoic and her son Charlie Jovanovic travelled to the region to raid three houses in April 2024, Newcastle Crown Court heard.
Prosecutor Daniel Cordey said the foursome, two of whom had been banned from Switzerland for thieving, were a professional gang of touring burglars.
Valentino, 32, who was found guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary, was jailed for 10 years while the others, who admitted their involvement, were imprisoned for between six and eight years each.
Mr Isak said the ""attack"" on his home had left him with a sense of unease.
The gang arrived in the UK on a ferry from Calais in the early hours of 27 March, the court heard, with the family travelling in a black Citroen C3 and a Ford campervan.
Their movements over the following days were tracked by SIM cards in their phones and the C3, as well as automatic number plate recognition cameras, Mr Cordey said.
Valentino Nikolov was found guilty of conspiracy to commit burglarly
They parked their ""base of operations"" campervan at Scotch Corner and Durham service stations while they used the C3 to scout out their targets and carry out the burglaries, the court heard.
Jela, 43, who was born in Zagreb, Croatia, and had previous convictions for fraud and theft in Belgium from 2011, was the gang's driver while her son and brothers ransacked the homes, Mr Cordey said.
They first targeted a home on Clayton Road in Jesmond, Newcastle, while the owners were on holiday, the court heard.
At about 20:45 BST on 31 March, the men broke in through a first-floor balcony door and stole a safe, high value watches, designer clothing, handbags, a CBE medal and gold coins, Mr Cordey said.
Giacomo Nikolov, Jela Jovanoic and Charlie Jovanovic admitted their involvement
The total value of the stolen goods exceeded Â£1m, the prosecutor said, with the vast majority of it unrecovered.
The following night, the gang broke into a home on a gated cul-de-sac in Whitburn, South Tyneside, and stole designer handbags, jewellery and shoes worth more than Â£100,000, the court heard.
They then spent two days near Newcastle United's training ground, monitoring the movements of staff and players, before targeting Mr Isak's home in Ponteland, the court heard.
The gang scouted out Newcastle United's training ground in Benton
On the evening of 4 April, the burglars smashed their way into the house on Middle Drive in Darrass Hall while the Swedish striker was visiting a teammate, the court heard.
They took an empty safe, which had been left by a previous owner, up to Â£10,000 in cash and ""bespoke"" jewellery worth Â£68,000, Mr Cordey said.
They also stole the footballer's car keys so they could use his Audi RS6 as a battering ram to force open his gates, with the vehicle, worth Â£120,000, later found abandoned nearby, the court heard.
Mr Cordey said the gang wore gloves and masks, switched their phones off as they neared their targets and strapped a number plate, which had been stolen from a garage in Chester-le-Street, on to their car with elastic bands.
They escaped with their loot to the Walsall and Birmingham area, where their car was stopped and they were arrested on 13 April, the court heard.
Giacomo, 28, who was born in Napoli and had convictions for theft in Italy, was wearing a Rolex watch stolen from the home in Jesmond, the court heard.
Valentino, who was born in Milan and had links to an address in Birmingham, and his 22-year-old nephew Charlie, born in Brescia, had both been jailed in Switzerland for carrying out a burglary on Christmas Eve 2022, the court heard, with the pair then expelled from the country for five and seven years respectively.
In a statement read to the court, Mr Isak said the ""attack"" on his home had left him with a ""sense of unease"" every time he left and returned to the house.
None of the goods taken from his home were recovered, the court heard, apart from the safe which was found heavily damaged in the Birmingham area.
Newcastle United's player liaison officer Glenn Patterson said he had always been ""proud"" to tell new and prospective recruits that the area was safe but the burglary of Mr Isak's home was one of several against players in recent times.
He said the club had had to invest heavily in security systems and patrols, with players fearing for the safety of their homes and families during matches and being instructed to ""moderate"" what they posted on social media.
""I'm not trying to be alarmist or over-reactive but these crimes have had an impact on the club which cannot be overstated,"" Mr Patterson said, adding it affected player recruitment and retention.
The victim of the Jesmond burglary said she and her husband had worked ""extremely hard"" for everything they owned and they had been devastated by the burglary.
She said much of the jewellery had been of great sentimental value and was irreplaceable, while her CBE medal had no worth to the burglars but was intended by her to become a family heirloom.
""The thieves have not only stolen our belongings but, just as importantly, they have stolen our privacy and security,"" she said.
The woman whose Whitburn home was targeted said she and her young children had lived in fear ever since.
""The peace, safety and security taken from us is unacceptable, let alone the stress and heartbreak caused,"" she said.
All four burglars apologised for the impact of their actions and said they wanted to be deported back to Italy to be with their families, the court heard.
Judge Robert Spragg said it was a highly sophisticated and planned ""family affair"" by a professional group of criminals.
Giacomo was jailed for eight years, Jela for seven years and two months and Charlie for six years and nine months.
He said deportation was automatic for foreign nationals jailed for more than a year.

The Spanish government has called for the removal of the listings of nearly 66,000 properties on rental platform Airbnb on the grounds that they breach regulations for tourist accommodation. 
The clampdown comes as protests against over-tourism have begun ahead of the summer season. Demonstrations in the Canary Islands on Sunday attracted thousands of people.
The minister for social rights, consumer affairs and the 2030 Agenda, Pablo Bustinduy, said the rental properties in question had ""violated various norms regarding housing for tourist use"".
The announcement followed a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must immediately withdraw from the market 4,984 of the properties cited by the ministry.
The properties are in six regions: Madrid, Andalusia, Catalonia, Valencia, the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands. 
Bustinduy's ministry is now awaiting further judicial rulings on the other 60,000 or so properties whose listings it deems unlawful.
According to the ministry, the properties it has identified either did not provide a licence number, provided an erroneous number, or did not specify the legal status of the owner to show whether they were renting on a professional basis or as a private individual.
He described the court's decision as ""a clear victory for those who fight to protect the right to housing"".
Bustinduy added that ""it can be possible to ensure that no economic interest has priority over housing and that no company, however big or powerful, is above the law"".
Housing has emerged as Spaniards' biggest concern in recent months, due to spiralling rental costs, particularly in larger towns and cities.

The cost of an average rental has doubled over the last decade, while salaries have failed to keep up.
Tourist apartments have been identified by many as a major cause of the problem, depriving local residents of accommodation. 
Spain is the world's second most popular tourist destination after France, with 94 million foreign visitors in 2024, a 13% rise on the previous year.
Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said earlier this year ""there are too many Airbnbs and not enough homes"", and he promised to prevent the ""uncontrolled"" expansion of the use of properties for tourism.
Spain is the second most popular country in the world for foreign tourists
Some local governments have also started to act against Airbnb. 
Barcelona City Hall has said it will eliminate its 10,000 short-term tourist apartments by the end of 2028. 
Others have taken a different approach. In recent months, Airbnb has reached agreements with local authorities in the Canary Islands, Ibiza and Murcia aimed at ensuring property owners comply with tourist rental rules.
Airbnb responded to the court ruling and Bustinduy's announcement by insisting it would appeal against decisions linked to this case and that no evidence of rule-breaking by hosts had been provided. 
It also cited a 2022 ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court which found that the responsibility for listing information lay with the host of each property, not the company, which was a ""neutral intermediary"" and not a real estate provider.
The firm also made a broader point about the Spanish housing problem.
""The root cause of the affordable housing crisis in Spain is a lack of supply to meet demand,"" said a spokesperson. ""Governments across the world are seeing that regulating Airbnb does not alleviate housing concerns or return homes to the market â it only hurts local families who rely on hosting to afford their homes and rising costs.""
Last summer, Spain saw a wave of protests against over-tourism in many popular destinations, with its impact on housing the biggest grievance. 
With the number of foreign visitors to Spain fast approaching 100 million per year, the unrest is expected to continue this summer.
On Sunday, several thousand people took to the streets across the Canary Islands under the slogan ""Canaries have a limit"". 
In Majorca, a group called Menys Turisme, MÃ©s Vida (Less tourism, more life) is preparing for similar actions, with a protest scheduled for 15 June."

French authorities have launched a nationwide hunt for thousands of tiny Chinese-made telephones used by convicts to continue criminal activities from inside prison.
The telephones, no bigger than a cigarette-lighter, are almost entirely plastic, and have a reputation for being virtually invisible to metal detectors.
Under Operation Prison Break, announced on Tuesday by the cyber crime branch of the Paris prosecutor's office, prison officers have been authorised to conduct searches in 500 cells in 66 detention centres.
According to Le Monde newspaper, the devices were nicknamed ""suppositories"" by prison inmates because of their ease of concealment.
""Investigations have established that some of these telephones were used to commit crimes from inside detention, including drugs trafficking, racketeering,  arson and attempted murder,"" a statement from the prosecutor's office said.
The French supplier of the devices â a company called Oportik â has been stopped from trading and three staff members arrested.  It is believed to have sold about 5,000 of the phones, the cheapest of which cost just â¬20 (Â£16.84).
Authorities said the smuggled phones had been facilitating crime from behind bars
France's Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin has pledged to crack down on drug gangs and other criminal organisations, whose leaders he said are too often able to continue to conduct operating even after being jailed.
In 2024 some 40,000 mobile phones were confiscated in prisons. Conventional devices are projected over prison walls or dropped by drones. Others are smuggled in by corrupt prison staff.  Phone-jamming is deployed in some jails, but there are doubts about its efficacity.
Similar mini-phones are manufactured in large numbers in China, according to Le Monde. While they are themselves perfectly legal in France, it is a crime to supply a prisoner with a phone.
The French prosecutor's office said it had passed information on how it traced the Oportik phones to the EU's judicial cooperation agency Eurojust, so that other countries can conduct similar clampdowns.
French authorities have been under pressure to tighten security in prisons"

""If Russia continues to put forward unrealistic conditions and undermine progress, there must be tough consequences,"" Ukraine's president wrote on social media, adding that Kyiv was ready to negotiate.
Following separate calls with Zelensky and Putin on Monday, Trump said truce talks between Russia and Ukraine would start ""immediately"".
Putin said he was ready to work on a ""memorandum on a possible future peace agreement"", but did not address calls for a 30-day pause in fighting. 
On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was up to Kyiv to ""make decisions"" and respond to a proposed peace memorandum.
However, the Kremlin downplayed suggestions that negotiations were close, with Russian state news agencies citing spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying ""there are no deadlines and there cannot be any"".
Meanwhile, Zelensky launched a fresh round of diplomacy, speaking to Western allies in a bid to shore up support. 
Following a phone call with the Finnish president, Zelensky wrote on social media that Ukraine was working with partners to ensure pressure on Moscow ""forces the Russians to change their behaviour"".
It came as the European Union and UK announced that they had adopted new rounds of sanctions against Russia.
The EU said it was blacklisting nearly 200 more oil tankers in Russia's ""shadow fleet"", and warned of a ""tougher response"" if Moscow did not agree to a truce in Ukraine.
The UK placed sanctions 18 more tankers, as part of its package targeting Russian military suppliers, energy exports and financial institutions.
It followed a record drone assault in Ukraine over the weekend, which Kyiv officials described as the largest since the start of the full-scale invasion.
On Monday, Trump indicated he would not join in any new sanctions on Russia, telling reporters that they could hinder recent progress.
It came as heavy fighting continued along the front line, with Ukraine reporting 177 clashes and claiming over 1,000 Russian casualties in 24 hours. 
Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU ministers on Tuesday, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Russia's continued attacks ""speak louder than the lip service we have heard for so long"". 
""Putin is clearly playing for time. Unfortunately, we have to say he is not really interested in peace,"" he said.
Putin has so far rebuffed a joint US-Ukrainian proposal for a 30-day ceasefire and last week rejected Zelensky's invitation to meet for talks in Istanbul. Trump had offered to attend the talks if Putin would be there, but the Russian leader declined.
The Kremlin has previously announced temporary ceasefires, including from 8-11 Mayto coincide with Russia's Second World War victory celebrations. Kyiv refused to join, citing mistrust and demanding an immediate, sustained cessation of hostilities.
A similar 30-hour truce over Easter saw a brief lull in fighting, though both sides accused each other of hundreds of violations.
Russia and Ukraine have been at war since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

""We don't think it will lead to any outcome. We don't know what will happen,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said.
US President Donald Trump said last week that Iran had ""sort of"" agreed to the terms of a deal following four rounds of talks mediated by Oman since 12 April.
But ahead of another round scheduled for this weekend, Iran's chief negotiator rejected his US counterpart's assertion that it would have to commit to stop producing enriched uranium, which can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons.
Trump, who pulled the US out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers during his first term in office, has warned Iran that it could face US and Israeli military action if the talks are not successful.
Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.
However, it has breached restrictions imposed by the existing nuclear deal in retaliation for crippling US sanctions reinstated seven years ago, and has stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs.
Khamenei addressed the latest developments in Iran's negotiations with the US at a ceremony honouring late President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash one year ago.
He praised Raisi, a fellow hardline cleric, for refusing direct talks with the US while in office.
""He clearly said 'no' without ambiguity,"" Khamanei noted, adding that Raisi did not let enemies ""drag Iran to the negotiating table through threats or tricks"".
Khamenei said nuclear talks under Raisi's predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani, had failed to achieve results, and that he did not think there would be any breakthrough under his successor, Masoud Pezeshkian, who is a reformist.
The supreme leader also criticised the Trump administration's approach, saying: ""The American side in these indirect talks should avoid nonsensical remarks.""
""Saying they will not allow Iran to enrich is a big mistake. No-one waits for their permission.""
US special envoy Steve Witkoff told ABC News in an interview on Sunday: ""We cannot allow even 1% of an enrichment capability. We've delivered a proposal to the Iranians that we think addresses some of this without disrespecting them.""
He added: ""We want to get to a solution here. And we think that will be able to.""
""But everything begins from our standpoint with a deal that does not include enrichment. We cannot have that. Because enrichment enables weaponisation, and we will not allow a bomb to get here.""
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi swiftly responded by warning Witkoff: ""Unrealistic expectations stop negotiations, enrichment in Iran is not something that can be stopped.""
""I think he is completely at a distance from the reality of the negotiations,"" he added.
The 2015 deal that Iran reached with then-US President Barack Obama's administration, as well as the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, saw it limit its nuclear activities and allow inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in return for sanctions relief.
Iran was only permitted to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity, which can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.
In February, the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that Iran had stockpiled almost 275kg (606lb) of uranium enriched to 60% purity, which is near weapons grade. That would theoretically be enough, if enriched to 90%, for six nuclear bombs."

Tanzania's President Samia Suluhu Hassan has warned activists from neighbouring Kenya that she will not allow them to ""meddle"" in her country's affairs and cause ""chaos"". 
Her comments came after prominent Kenyan lawyers and rights campaigners were deported, preventing them from attending the court case of an opposition leader charged with treason. 
""If they have been contained in their country, let them not come here to meddle. Let's not give them a chance. They have already created chaos in their own country,"" Samia said. 
Human rights groups are concerned that the Tanzanian government is increasingly cracking down on the opposition ahead of elections in October. 
On Monday, the leader of the main opposition Chadema party, Tundu Lissu, appeared in a magistrate's court after being arrested last month. 
He raised his fist in a gesture of defiance and told his supporters: ""You will be fine. You should not fear.""
There was a heavy deployment of security officers at the court in Dar es Salaam, the  largest city. 
This did not deter Lissu's supporters, hundreds of whom had gathered outside.
The case was adjourned to 2 June after the prosecution asked for more time for investigations. 
The court had previously attempted to conduct proceedings virtually, but Lissu's legal team opposed this, citing the need for transparency.
The Chadema party leader was arrested on 9 April following his rallying call for ""no reforms, no election"". 
He is demanding sweeping changes, saying Tanzania's current laws do not allow for free and fair elections. The government denies the allegation.. 
He has since been charged with treason and publishing false information online, which allegedly incited rebellion and accused police of electoral misconduct. 
He denies the charges. If convicted, he could face the death penalty.
Could this be the end of the road for Lissu, Tanzania's great survivor?
Lissu's legal team raised concerns over the heavy police presence around the court, which the magistrate acknowledged, saying there would be consultations on whether this was justified.
President Samia was widely praised for giving Tanzanians greater political freedom when she took office in 2021 following the death of the incumbent, John Magufuli.
But her critics say Tanzania is once again seeing the repression that characterised Magufuli's rule. The government denies the allegation.
The Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC) said that Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi and Ugandan lawyer Agather Atuhaire had been detained after they arrived for Lissu's case.
The chief spokesperson for Tanzania's immigration authority, Paul Mselle, said he was not aware of the arrests, but would look into it, the Reuters news agency reports.
On Sunday, Kenya's former Justice Minister Martha Karua was deported from Tanzania along with two colleagues to prevent them from attending Lissu's court case.
Hours later, former Kenyan chief justice Willy Mutunga and other prominent rights activists said they had been stopped and held at the airport. 
But another former Kenyan chief justice, David Maraga, was in court and said that he hoped ""the legal process ahead will be fair, just, and expeditious"".
Speaking at the launch of Tanzania's new foreign policy in Dar es Salaam on Monday, Samia stressed that she would not tolerate external efforts to undermine her country's peace and stability.
""We will not give a chance to anyone to come and destroy us,"" she said. 
She instructed the authorities not to allow ""those who have spoiled their countries to cross over to Tanzania... and spread their indiscipline here"".
""I have seen several clips saying I am biased, but what I am doing is protecting my country which is the key mandate I was given,"" the president added.
Recent events in Tanzania, including the arrest of other opposition figures and a wave of abductions and killings targeting government critics, have sparked condemnation and calls for an end to political repression.
The Chadema party has been disqualified from contesting the general election after refusing to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.

Seven Mexican youths have been shot dead at a festivity organised by the Catholic Church in the central state of Guanajuato.
Gunmen opened fire on a group of people who had stayed behind in the central square of the village of San Bartolo de Berrios after an event organised by the local parish. 
Eyewitnesses said the assailants had driven straight to the village square in the early hours of Monday and fired dozens of shots seemingly at random. 
The authorities have not yet said what the motive behind the shooting may have been but messages scrawled on signs left at several nearby locations appear to indicate it was carried out by the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel. 

While attacks on nightclubs, bars and cockfighting venues are not unusual in Mexican states hit by cartel violence, an attack on an event organised by the Catholic Church is rare. 
The Episcopal Conference of Mexico, which represents the country's bishops, condemned the fatal shooting saying it ""cannot remain indifferent in the face of the spiral of violence that is wounding so many communities"".
The local archbishop, Jaime CalderÃ³n, also released a statement blaming the attack on a fight for territory between rival cartels. 
Guanajuato, where San Bartolo de Berrios is located, had the highest number of murders of any state in Mexico in 2024 with a total of 2,597 homicides.
Both the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel are active in the state and have been locked in a deadly battle for control over territory.
While the two groups engage in extortion and drug trafficking, they have also  increasingly tapped pipelines which run through the state carrying petrol from refineries to major distribution points. 
The practice of stealing and selling fuel on the black market - known as huachicoleo - is a major source of revenue for the criminal gangs in the region.
In their fight for territorial control, the gangs often try to spread fear amid the local population in order to ensure their silence and compliance.
Bloody shootings such as the one in San Bartolo de Berrios and the subsequent display of threatening messages are a particularly brutal way gangs use to show they have expanded into a particular town.
Residents of San Bartolo de Berrios said they had heard around 100 shots ring out in the early hours of Monday within the space of a few minutes. 
They said the scene in the central square resembled ""a bloodbath"" with the bodies of the seven youths, two of them aged under 18, strewn across the pavement. 
No arrests have so far been made in connection with the attack."

Parts of the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, often called India's Silicon Valley are under water after heavy rainfall. 
The city is on high alert for more pre-monsoon showers on Tuesday due to cyclonic formations over the Andaman Sea, according to authorities. 
Three people, including a 12-year-old boy were killed in rain-related incidents on Monday.
Bengaluru is home to major global technology companies, many of whom have asked their employees to work from home due to flooded roads. 
Large parts of the city have been flooded by heavy rain that began on Sunday
Many parts of the city received 100 mm (4in) of rain on Monday, a record since 2011. 
This is ""rare"" for Bengaluru, CS Patil, a director at the regional weather department  told news agencies. 
Apart from severe water-logging and traffic disrupting daily life, heavy rainfall has also caused property damage. 
In one of the city's major IT corridors, the compound wall of a software firm - i-Zed - collapsed on Monday morning, killing a 35-year-old female employee.
Videos also showed commuters wading through knee-deep water, with several cars parked on waterlogged streets. Water has also entered houses in some parts of the city. 
Authorities say the city corporation has identified 210 flood-prone areas where they were working round the clock to ""rectify"" the situation. 
""There is no need for the people of Bengaluru to be worried,"" DK Shivakumar, deputy chief minister of Karnataka state told reporters on Monday. 
But officials are facing criticism on social media with many complaining about the city's crumbling infrastructure and deluged roads. 
""No other city invokes a sense of fear and helplessness for commuting during rains as Bangalore does,"" a user wrote on X.
Annu Itty, who has lived in the city for eight years told the BBC that the city's infrastructure becomes especially fragile in the monsoons. 
""Ironically, it's the newly developed areas - those built to house the booming tech sector - that face the worst flooding,"" she said. 
Itty, who works in public policy, says a ""lack of coherent urban planning that respects environmental limits"", as well as a lack of government accountability, has left Bengaluru residents to deal with the consequences. 
The city is on high alert for more rain on Tuesday
People are wading through knee deep water in the city
Karnataka, of which Bengaluru is the capital is currently run by the Congress party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the state has  accused the local government of failing to tackle rain-related issues in the city and the state, despite spending million of rupees on its infrastructure.
The BJP has demanded the immediate release of 10bn rupees ($117m, Â£87.5m) for relief operations.
The state government has, however, defended itself saying these were long-standing issues.
""The issues we face today are not new. They have been ignored for years, across governments and administrations,"" Shivakumar said.
Floods have been a recurring phenomenon in Bengaluru in recent years.  Experts partly blame rapid construction over the city's lakes and wetlands and poor urban planning for the crisis.
Ananda Rao, president of the Association for Information Technology (AIT) - which represents over 450 software companies - told the BBC that such frequent flooding has caused ""discomfort and inconvenience"" for businesses. 
""Bengaluru contributes significantly in taxes - both at an individual level and property tax. There is no return on this investment,"" he said, calling on the state government to work on long-term solutions to improve the city's infrastructure."

Acclaimed Russian ballet choreographer, Yuri Grigorovich, has died aged 98.
Described as one of the greatest choreographers of the 20th century, he was artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995, which he is said to have led with an iron fist.
Grigorovich's productions of the Stone Flower, Ivan the Terrible and Romeo and Juliet redefined Soviet ballet. Praised for revitalising male dance, he created parts for men demanding exceptional strength and artistry.
Born in 1927, a decade after the Bolshevik Revolution, his work was steeped in the traditions of classical ballet.
His uncle, Georgy Rozai, had studied under the legendary Vaslav Nijinsky and the young Grigorovich went on to dance as a soloist with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad before turning to choreography.
His departure from the Bolshoi in 1995, amid disputes over performers' contracts, led to the first ever dancers' strike at the theatre in its 200-year history. During a scheduled performance, a dancer emerged to inform the audience the show was cancelled, leaving a stunned silence.
The Bolshoi Ballet was led by Grigorovich from 1964 to 1995.
Following the Soviet Union's collapse, the Bolshoi faced instability. Grigorovich moved to Krasnodar to found a new ballet company. He returned to the Bolshoi in 2008 as a choreographer and ballet master.
Grigorovich received top Soviet and Russian honours, including the titles People's Artist of the USSR and Hero of Socialist Labour. His wife, renowned ballerina Natalia Bessmertnova, died in 2008.
His death came on the same day as that of one of his most celebrated collaborators, dancer Yuri Vladimirov, aged 83.
Valery Gergiev, the controversial head of the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theatres, told Izvestia newspaper that Grigorovich was ""a legendary figure who will continue to command respect and admiration for decades to come"".
Gergiev, a long-time backer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has seen his global stature collapse since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with major institutions across Europe severing ties due to his refusal to condemn the war.
Known for endorsing Russia's seizure of Crimea and receiving top state honours, Gergiev remains a central cultural figure within Russia.
In January, Putin wished Grigorovich happy birthday, calling him ""the pride of the Russian ballet"" who ""embodies an entire era in the history of Russian""."

The ruling lifts a hold that was placed by a California judge that kept Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in place for Venezuelans whose status would have expired last month.
Temporary Protected Status allows people to live and work in the US legally if their home countries are deemed unsafe due to things like countries experiencing wars, natural disasters or other ""extraordinary and temporary"" conditions.
The ruling marks a win for US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly tried to use the Supreme Court to enact immigration policy decisions.
Venezuelans living in the US were first granted TPS in 2021.
The secretary of Homeland Security at the time, Alejandro N Mayorkas, said the Biden administration had taken the decision ""due to extraordinary and temporary conditions in Venezuela that prevent nationals from returning safely"".
He said the South American country was suffering ""a complex humanitarian crisis marked by widespread hunger and malnutrition, a growing influence and presence of non-state armed groups, repression, and a crumbling infrastructure"".
According to the UN's refugee agency, almost eight million Venezuelans have left their homeland since the crisis began in 2014. Most of them are living in Latin American and Caribbean countries but hundreds of thousands moved to the United States. 
The Trump administration wanted to end protections and work permits for migrants  with TPS in April 2025, more than a year before they were originally supposed to end in October 2026.
Lawyers representing the US government argued the California federal court, the US District Court for the Northern District of California, had undermined ""the Executive Branch's inherent powers as to immigration and foreign affairs,"" when it stopped the administration from ending protections and work permits in April. 
Ahilan Arulanantham, who represents TPS holders in the case, told the BBC he believed this to be ""the largest single action stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status in modern US history"".
""That the Supreme Court authorized this action in a two-paragraph order with no reasoning is truly shocking,"" Mr Arulanantham said. ""The humanitarian and economic impact of the Court's decision will be felt immediately, and will reverberate for generations.""
Because it was an emergency appeal, justices on the Supreme Court did not provide a reasoning for the ruling. 
The court's order only noted one judge's dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.
In August, the Trump administration is also expected to revoke TPS protections for tens of thousands of Haitians.
The ruling on Monday by the Supreme Court marks the latest in a series of decisions on immigration policies from the high court that the Trump administration has left them to rule on.
What is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants?
Last week, the administration asked the Supreme Court to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuela immigrants. 
Along with some of their successes, the Trump administration was dealt a blow on Friday when the high court blocked Trump from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants in north Texas. 
Trump had wanted to use the centuries-old law to swiftly deport thousands from the US, but Supreme Court judges questioned if the president's action was legal."

At least 38 Palestinians were killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip during a half-hour period overnight, according to Palestinian medics.
Israeli warplanes struck several locations, including a school in eastern Gaza City, and an abandoned fuel station sheltering displaced families in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, according to the Hamas-run civil defence agency.
It added that rescue teams were facing major difficulties reaching the wounded due to a lack of equipment and the intensity of the bombardment.
The attack comes after Israel issued a sweeping evacuation order for civilians in Gaza in preparation for what it said was an ""unprecedented attack"".

Ten people were killed when an Israeli air strike hit classrooms at the Musa bin Nusayr School, where hundreds of displaced people were sheltering, according to local activists in Gaza City.
In central Gaza, 15 people were reported killed in a strike targeting tents at an abandoned fuel station in Nuseirat.
Meanwhile, local journalists said 13 Palestinians were killed in an air strike on the Abu Samra family's three-story home in central Deir al-Balah.
Separately, Israeli jets launched 10 air strikes on the Shujaiya neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City. 
Local reports described the blasts as causing tremors similar to an earthquake. The strikes are believed to have targeted Hamas's network of underground tunnels.
The attack comes as the leaders of the UK, France and Canada issued a joint statement threatening action if Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu persisted with his goal to ""take control"" of all of Gaza.
Netanyahu described the statement as a ""huge prize"" for Hamas.
Earlier, Israel said it would allow a ""basic amount"" of food into Gaza, ending an 11-week blockade of the territory.
But United Nations aid chief Tom Fletcher said the amount of aid was a ""drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"". 
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage.
Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.

""Fantastic! Getting people talking about art. Broadening the conversation,"" said one commenter on a social media post announcing Boom Boom's arrival.
But another wrote: ""Public investment of $100,000 from the local ratepayers, many of who would have rather seen the money spent elsewhere in the community.""
Funding for Boom Boom was finalised in 2018, before recent hikes in TaupÅ District Council's rate which is similar to a council tax.
After several years of negotiations, the work was completed and installed in the park last week.
Others still criticised the work as having no connection with TaupÅ, named New Zealand's most beautiful town in the 2023 Keep New Zealand Beautiful Awards.
But Kregar said the rock that the dinosaur stands on is inspired by the volcanic history of the area.
TaupÅ Sculpture Park is located near Lake TaupÅ, on New Zealand's North Island
Lake TaupÅ, from which the town takes its name, is a large caldera, a volcano that has collapsed in on itself. It last erupted around 1,800 years ago.
Sauropods, the inspiration for Boom Boom, are one of a few species of dinosaurs that paleontologists say lived in New Zealand. 
They became extinct 66 million years ago, along with other non-avian dinosaurs.
Kregar says the spirited debate around the sculpture means Boom Boom could eventually win round ""the haters"".
""You put the sculpture out there, there is reaction, people start falling in love with it, and then it becomes something that they start embracing, part of the local identity,"" he said.
Kim Gillies, secretary of the TaupÅ Sculpture Trust, told the BBC that the decision to commission Boom Boom was not taken ""lightly"", but that it was chosen because ""it would help put TaupÅ on the map"".
Gillies added that when it comes to the art, ""safe is a bit boring, right?""
No bones about it."

A British ultra-endurance athlete says he has broken the world record for running across the width of Australia, after a gruelling 35-day journey.
William Goodge, 31, started the 3,800km (2,361-mile) run from Cottesloe Beach in Perth on 15 April, and finished on Monday afternoon at Australia's iconic Bondi Beach, his father by his side.
Goodge's team says he ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons - about 100km - every day. 
Originally from Bedfordshire in England, Goodge started running marathons after his mother, Amanda, died from cancer in 2018, with this journey raising money for cancer charities in the UK, US and Australia.
The record is yet to be verified by Guinness World Records, which certified Chris Turnbull's record-breaking dash across the continent over 39 days in 2023. The year before, Australian electrician Nedd Brockmann ran the same route in 47 days, raising millions for charity.
Speaking to BBC Breakfast about 24 hours after he had crossed the finish line, Goodge said ""it's the toughest thing I've ever done"". 
Along the way Goodge ran through a dust storm, lost several toenails, and suffered from injuries, including rotting feet and bone pain, which sometimes caused him to hallucinate.
""It was full-on from start to finish,"" he told the BBC, adding the first nine days were particularly hard.



The Nullabor Plain - a vast area of desert that crosses from Western Australia to South Australia - was also ""unforgiving"", he said.
Surprisingly though, Goodge said he was ""feeling very comfortable"" now that the run was over.
Moments after crossing the finish line, Goodge placed a bunch of flowers on Bondi's famous shoreline in memory of his late mother. 
""She was the most special person in my life,"" he told the Guardian Australia, adding, ""she would be proud of everything I've done - she'd also be concerned"". 

Goodge said thinking about how his mother battled cancer was crucial during his journey, and helped him overlook his own suffering.
""In the moments where it's tough, I'll think back to those times, I think about the woman she was, and how she handled herself, and how she supported me,"" he told the Sydney Morning Herald.
""I feel like she's there with me a lot of the time.""
During the race, he says he saw almost all of Australia's famous animals - though most were dead on the road - and much of its unique countryside.
Some in the running community however have questioned the accuracy of data tracking his speed and heart rate, external over the course of the run.
""Goodge stands by his record keeping and asserts that he is taking every single step,"" his agent told the Canadian Running magazine last week. 
Goodge also claims to hold the record for the fastest British man to run across the US, crossing from Los Angeles to New York in 55 days.

Australia's conservative Liberal-National coalition - the nation's main opposition political party - has split after a partnership lasting almost 80 years.
The move marks a seismic change in the country's political landscape and comes just weeks after a federal election that saw Labor win a second term in a landslide victory.
Nationals leader David Littleproud on Tuesday said his party was not re-entering a coalition agreement, amid policy disagreements with the Liberal Party as it goes on a journey of ""rediscovery"" following the emphatic loss.
Littleproud added that the Coalition has been broken and repaired before, and he hoped that - with time - the parties could reconcile again.
The Liberal Party - which has the second largest number of seats in parliament - will remain the formal opposition party, though now in their own right. This means the Nationals will not hold any opposition roles. 
""Whilst we have enormous respect for David Littleproud and his team, it is disappointing that the National Party has taken the decision to leave the Coalition,"" newly elected Liberal leader Sussan Ley said, hours after the shock announcement.
Ley said the founding principle of the Coalition had long been ""shared values"", but said the Nationals had refused to sign a deal without commitments to ""specific policies"".
The split comes after days of post-election talks between the two parties about their future, with Littleproud's party - which mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals - failing to reach an agreement with their long-time political ally. 
A key issue that had strained their relationship was climate and energy, with some in the National Party still opposed to net-zero emissions goals, and wedded to a nuclear power proposal which proved controversial at the election.
Littleproud also pointed to regional infrastructure spending and policies to improve supermarket competition as points of conflict.
Describing it as ""one of the hardest political decisions of his life"", Littleproud said he had a ""respectful conversation"" with Ley to inform her of the split on Tuesday morning.
""What this is about is taking a deep breath and saying to the Australian people, this is time apart [for] us to be better, [to] focus on them.
""I gave [Ley] the commitment that I'll work with her every day to help to try to rebuild the relationship to the point we can re-enter a coalition before the next election.""
However, he said the National Party would contest the next election solo if unity could not be achieved.
The Liberal-National partnership, which in its current form dates back to the 1940s, has broken down and been re-established several times over the decades. The last time the Coalition split was almost four decades ago, in 1987. 
All except one of the 15 electorates the Liberal-National coalition lost at the election were ceded by the Liberals, who saw big swings against them right around the nation.
Support for the Liberals nosedived in more moderate areas, particularly in cities, which analysts largely put down to then-leader Peter Dutton's polarising persona and some Trump-like policies. Ley, his successor, has vowed to bring the party back to the centre-right."

As a British teenager is held in jail in Georgia on suspicion of drug offences, a report by inspectors sheds light on what life is like inside Rustavi's prison number 5. 
Bella Culley, 18, from Billingham, Teesside, is behind bars after being arrested in Tbilisi and charged with importing large quantities of narcotics.
She is currently detained for 55 days while the prosecution investigates, but the BBC understands this could be extended by up to a further seven months.
The latest inspection of the prison, carried out by the ombudsman of Georgia, found a range of issues from a lack of exercise time to intermittent drinking water supplies and frequent verbal conflict between inmates.
The BBC has approached the Georgian Ministry of Justice for comment.
Ombudsman inspectors made monitoring visits to prison number 5 in March and May 2023 to assess the treatment of female prisoners and the implementation of previous recommendations.
The visits were reportedly prompted by inmate complaints about the lack of access to proper hygiene.
Bella Culley was arrested in Tbilisi
The inspection found new inmates spent up to two weeks in internal classification cells before being assigned to a block.
According to the resulting report: ""Even though they are legally guaranteed the right to exercise, they are unable to benefit from this right. 
""The internal classification cells are located in the C residential building of the facility, and there is no designated outdoor space available for the inmates housed there to get fresh air.""
The watchdog advised that the lack of exercise for new prisoners should be investigated by the ministry in charge of penal reform.
A warning sign outside of prison number 5 in Rustavi, Georgia
The report acknowledges that in recent years improvements had been made to cleanliness at the facility.
However, ""it was found that the facility frequently does not receive drinking water"".
Both prisoners and staff are forced to collect and store water in containers.
BBC Sounds: Bella Culley - what we know so far
Inmates reported instances where the water was unexpectedly cut off while they were taking a shower, forcing them to continue their showers using cold water stored in containers.
Prisoners in closed-type residential units were only allowed showers twice a week.
The report also stated the ""ventilation systems in the showers and kitchen areas were insufficient"" and that ""these issues contribute to an unsatisfactory environment for the inmates"".
Bella Culley will be detained inside prison number 5 for at least 55 days
Monitoring also revealed conflicts between inmates did occur at the prison.
According to the facility's internal documentation, ""verbal altercations among prisoners are frequent"", while incidents of physical violence were relatively rare.
In 2022, there were 11 recorded cases of physical altercations between inmates, but in 2023 only two such cases were documented.
The report stated: ""Conflicts among prisoners are primarily triggered by gossip, the spreading of false information about one another, and various domestic or day-to-day issues.""
Any fights were broken up by prison staff and those involved were given sanctions, the report said.
The length of time Miss Culley is held in the prison pre-trial can be increased by the prosecution
Miss Culley was charged by police with illegally buying, possessing and importing large quantities of narcotics, after officers said they had seized marijuana and the narcotic drug hashish in a travel bag at Tbilisi International Airport.
A spokesperson said the arrest was the result of a joint operation between multiple departments and, if found guilty, Miss Culley could face up to 20 years in jail or life imprisonment.
Cleveland Police confirmed an 18-year-old woman from Billingham was arrested in Georgia ""on suspicion of drugs offences"" and remained in custody.

A memorial bust of American singer Jim Morrison that was stolen from his grave 37 years ago has been found by chance, according to French police.
The statue of The Doors frontman was recovered in Paris during an investigation conducted by its financial and anti-corruption arm that was unrelated to the original theft, it said in a post on Instagram.
Morrison's grave has long been a site for fans of the rock band to pay their respects in an unusual way - graffiti sprawls across neighbouring gravestones in the poet's corner of the famous PÃ¨re-Lachaise cemetery, which also houses the tombs of Edith Piaf and Oscar Wilde.
Little information has been released about the investigation and no suspects have been named in the theft of the statue of the singer, who died in 1971.
The police made the discovery when looking into a case of fraud, a source close to the investigation told news agency Agence France-Presse.
It is not clear if the bust will be put back on the grave, with the cemetery's curator telling Le Figaro: ""The police haven't contacted us, so I don't know whether the bust will be returned to us.""
Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin carved the statue from white marble to mark the 10th anniversary of the singer's death. But it disappeared in 1988, seven years after the bust was placed at the site.
A picture released by the French police shows the statue's mouth and nose missing, as they had been before it was stolen.
The bust disappeared from the grave in 1988, seven years after it was placed to mark the 10th anniversary of his death.
Speaking to Rolling Stone, a representative of the Morrison estate said it was ""happy to hear the news"" that the ""piece of history"" had been found, adding that Morrison's family wanted it on the grave ""so it's gratifying to see that it's been recovered"".
This is not the first time the singer's grave has been the source of controversy. On the 20th anniversary of his death fans rioted at his grave and had to be dispersed by police.
Morrison was living in the Marais district of Paris when he died suddenly at the age of 27. 
He was found dead in the bath by his girlfriend, Pamela Courson. A doctor's report stated the cause of death was heart failure aggravated by heavy drinking.
Morrison, the son of a US Navy admiral, was born in 1943 in Florida.
He formed The Doors with keyboardist Ray Manzarek in 1965 in Los Angeles
The band name was inspired by Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception, about the author's drug use."

Vietnamese authorities have arrested a beauty queen and social media influencer for consumer fraud after she promoted a counterfeit fibre supplement.
Nguyen Thuc Thuy Tien had heavily marketed gummies said to be rich in fibre on her social media channels.
But a public backlash erupted after product tests revealed this was untrue.
A former winner of the Miss Grand International beauty competition, Ms Nguyen is a well-known personality in Vietnam and previously received accolades from the government.
Ms Nguyen had promoted Kera Supergreens Gummies along with social media influencers, Pham Quang Linh and Hang Du Muc.
Investigators said the product was the result of a joint venture between Ms Nguyen and a company set up by the two other influencers.
The influencers claimed that each of their gummies contained fibre equivalent to a plate of vegetables.
A member of the public sent the product for testing at a lab, which found that each gummy only contained 16mg of fibre, far from 200mg as claimed.
Authorities then launched an investigation, which found that sub-standard ingredients that were low in fibre were used in the manufacture of the gummies.
The product's packaging also did not state the fibre content, nor did it state that the product contained a high level of sorbitol, which is used in laxatives.

Nguyen Thuc Thuy Tien, Hang Du Muc and Pham Quang Linh are well-known Vietnamese influencers
The three influencers were fined in March, and apologised to the public. 
The following month, Vietnamese authorities arrested Mr Pham and Hang Du Muc as well as officials from their company and the gummies' manufacturer.
They were charged with producing counterfeit goods and defrauding customers.
On Monday, authorities announced the arrest of Ms Nguyen for allegedly deceiving customers.
More than 100,000 boxes of the gummies were reportedly sold before sales were halted due to the scandal.
After winning the Bangkok-based beauty pageant in 2021, Ms Nguyen became a celebrity sought after by many Vietnamese brands, and appeared on several reality TV shows.
She also received certificates of merit from the prime minister and the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union under Vietnam's ruling Communist Party."

The UK, France and Canada have warned Israel they will take ""concrete actions"" if it continues an ""egregious"" expansion of military operations in Gaza.
Sir Keir Starmer joined the French and Canadian leaders to call on the Israeli government to ""stop its military operations"" and ""immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza"".  
No food, fuel or medicine had been allowed into Gaza since 2 March, a situation the UN previously described as taking a ""disastrous toll"" on the Palestinian population. 
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by saying the three leaders had offered a ""huge prize"" for Hamas in the Gaza war.
On Sunday, Netanyahu said his country would allow a ""basic amount of food"" to enter the territory after an 11-week long blockade but it planned to take ""control of all of Gaza"".  
The three Western leaders criticised this as ""wholly inadequate"", external as the ""denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law"".
They added the level of suffering in Gaza was ""intolerable"". 
They also condemned ""the abhorrent language used recently by members of the Israeli Government, threatening that, in their despair at the destruction of Gaza, civilians will start to relocate"". 
""Permanent forced displacement is a breach of international humanitarian law,"" they added. 
UN humanitarian relief chief Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat, said the number of aid trucks which had been cleared to enter was a ""drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"".
""We have always supported Israel's right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate,"" the leaders' statement added, referring to Israel's renewed offensive. 
Sir Keir, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney also called for Hamas to immediately release the remaining hostages taken in the ""heinous attack"" on southern Israel on 7 October 2023. 
The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack which saw around 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage.
Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas, says more than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign.
The statement from the UK, France and Canada reiterated support for a ceasefire as well as the implementation of a ""two-state solution"", which proposes an independent Palestinian state which would exist alongside Israel. 
Netanyahu hit back at the suggestion: ""By asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.""
He also called on ""all European leaders"" to follow US President Donald ""Trump's vision"" for ending the conflict."

Trump, who described the conversation as having gone ""very well"", also said conditions for peace would need to be negotiated between the two parties. 
Despite the note of optimism from Trump, who also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, any ceasefire or peace deal does not appear close.
Putin said he was ready to work with Ukraine on a ""memorandum on a possible future peace agreement"", while Zelensky said ""this is a defining moment"", and urged the US not to distance itself from talks.
Donald Trump has repeatedly called for an end to the Ukraine war 
In his remarks, the Russian president did not address demands from the US and European countries for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.
After his one-on-one call with Trump, Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine's desire for a ""full and unconditional ceasefire"", and warned if Moscow is not ready, ""there must be stronger sanctions"".
Speaking earlier before Trump's conversation with Putin, Zelensky said he had asked that any decisions about Ukraine were not made without his country, calling them ""matters of principles"" for Ukraine.
He added he did not have any details on a ""memorandum"" but said once they have received anything from the Russians, they will ""be able to formulate their vision accordingly"".
Writing on his Truth Social page after the call, Trump said: ""Russia and Ukraine will immediately start negotiations toward a Ceasefire and, more importantly, an END to the War,"" adding he had informed Zelensky of this in a second call, which also included other world leaders. 
He added: ""The conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.""
Zelensky said the negotiation process ""must involve both American and European representatives at the appropriate level"".
""It is crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace, because the only one who benefits from that is Putin,"" he explained.
Talking at a White House event later in the day, Trump said the US would not be stepping away from brokering talks between Russia and Ukraine, but that he has a ""red line in his head"" on when he will stop pushing on them both.
He also denied that the US was stepping back from its negotiating role. 
In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly warned that the US would step away from negotiations as he became increasingly frustrated at the lack of developments from both Moscow and Kyiv in the way of peace.
When asked on what he believes on Russia, he said he thinks Putin has had enough of the war and wants it to end. 
Meanwhile, Putin - who described the call with Trump, which he took from a music school on a visit to the city of Sochi, as ""frank, informative and constructive"" - also spoke of the potential for a ceasefire.
""We have agreed with the US president that Russia will offer and is ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum on a possible future peace agreement,"" he said.
This, he added would define ""a number of positions"" including ""principles of the settlement and a timeline for concluding a possible peace agreement...including a possible ceasefire for a certain period of time, should relevant agreements be reached"". 
Yury Ushakov, an aide to the Russian president, said a ceasefire timeframe was not ""discussed... although Trump, of course, emphasises his interest in reaching one or another agreement as soon as possible"".
Zelensky called this a defining moment for peace negotiations
Zelensky held a second call with Trump after the US president spoke to Putin, which also included President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and the leaders of  France, Italy, Germany and Finland.
""I want to thank President Trump for his tireless efforts to bring a ceasefire to Ukraine,"" von der Leyen said, adding: ""It's important that the US stays engaged.""
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Pope Leo's offer to host potential peace talks was a gesture welcomed by the US and the other leaders in the call, and ""judged positively"".
Earlier this month, the new Pope offered the Vatican as a venue for possible peace talks after Putin turned down Zelensky's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey for negotiations.
Kyiv has previously said Putin's comments saying he desires peace are hollow.
""Putin wants war,"" Andriy Yermak, a top aide to the Ukrainian president, said after Russia on Sunday launched what Ukraine said was its biggest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began. 
Ukraine says at least 10 people have been killed in Russian strikes in recent days - including nine people in an attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine. Russia says it has also intercepted Ukrainian drones. 
The strike on the bus happened just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years. A prisoner swap was agreed but there was no commitment to a ceasefire.
Trump had offered to attend the talks in Turkey if Putin would also be there, but the Russian president declined to go.
Russia has declared ceasefires before - but only temporary ones. It declared one for 8-11 May - which coincided with victory celebrations to mark the end of World War Two - but Kyiv would not sign up to it, saying Putin could not be trusted and that an immediate 30-day ceasefire was needed. 
The Kremlin announced a similar, 30-hour truce over Easter, but while both sides reported a dip in fighting, they accused each other of hundreds of violations.
Russia and Ukraine have been at war since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

""Cancer touches us all,"" Biden wrote on social media on Monday morning. ""Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.""
On Sunday, Biden's office disclosed that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.
The news comes as fresh questions are being raised about the former president's health while he was in office. 
President Donald Trump posted that he was ""saddened"" by Biden's diagnosis but later questioned - without providing any evidence - whether Biden's team had known earlier about his illness and concealed the news from the public. 
""I am surprised that the public wasn't notified a long time ago because to get to stage nine that takes a long time,"" he said at the White House on Monday afternoon.
""It could take years to get to this level of danger,"" he said, adding: ""I feel very badly about it, and I think people should try and find out what happened.""
Late-stage diagnoses for cancer are not unheard of, however. One UK study in 2014 found 46% of cancer diagnoses in that country were only made at an advanced stage. 
Biden's office said that he was diagnosed on Friday with prostate cancer ""characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone"".
""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.""
A Gleason score of nine means his illness is classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK.
What we know about Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis
Analysis: Cancer diagnosis is another formidable challenge
Biden said his diagnosis was made after he reported urinary symptoms which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate.
In the wake of the cancer diagnosis, many have offered Biden their support including former President Barack Obama and former Vice-President Kamala Harris. 
King Charles has written privately to Biden offering his support and best wishes, Buckingham Palace said. 
The king, 76, who has met Biden a number of times, is also receiving treatment for an unspecified type of cancer after his diagnosis in 2024.
Biden had then sent his best wishes, saying: ""I'm concerned about him. Just heard about his diagnosis. I'll be talking to him, God willing.""
Vance raises questions on Biden's health during time in office
Vice-President JD Vance offered well wishes, but questioned whether the American people had a clear picture of Biden's health while the former president was in office. 
""We really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,"" Vance said on Monday.  ""And that's that's â¦ you can separate the desire for him to have the right health outcome with a recognition that whether it was doctors or whether there were staffers around the former president, I don't think he was able to do a good job for the American people.""
Vance also said he blamed the people around him more than Biden himself.
""This is not child's play, and we can pray for good health, but also recognise that if you're not in good enough health to do the job, you shouldn't be doing the job,"" he added.
The announcement comes as Biden staves off criticism from a forthcoming book that claims he and his advisers hid his deteriorating health while he was in the White House.  
Details revealed last week from the book entitled, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, include Biden not recognising actor and frequent Democratic donor George Clooney at a fundraiser last year and aides discussing putting the former president in a wheelchair. 
The book will be released on Tuesday.

The US Department of Homeland Security has said 64 people took a government-funded flight to their home countries as part of a new programme encouraging undocumented immigrants to ""self-deport.""
The initiative, dubbed ""Project Homecoming"", is part of President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, which has also involved detaining hundreds of migrants in a Salvadoran mega-prison.
Immigrants can leave the country on their own, in exchange for free travel and a $1,000 (Â£749) stipend, and avoid detention or other punishments for being in the US illegally.
The first government-chartered flight took off from Texas and travelled to Honduras and Colombia.
Homeland Security characterised the trip as a ""voluntarily charter flight,"" and not an operation of the US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency. 
Of the 64 individuals on the flight, 38 returned to Honduras and 26 people went to Colombia, the department said.
In March, the Trump administration announced that people in the US illegally could utilise the border patrol app, CPB Home, to depart the country voluntarily. Since then, it has sent some people home on commercial flights.
Officials have described Project Homecoming as a smoother alternative to forcible deportations.
""If you are here illegally, use the CBP Home App to take control of your departure and receive financial support to return home,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.
""If you don't, you will be subjected to fines, arrest, deportation and will never be allowed to return,"" Noem said.
Trump's other deportation initiatives have faced significant pushback from immigrants rights groups and numerous lawsuits. 
Some of the legal battles have reached the US Supreme Court, with a mix of wins and losses for Trump.
On Saturday, the justices barred the administration from continuing to use the 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act to continue to deport Venezuelan migrants it has accused of gang membership.
Then on Monday, the court allowed the Trump administration to end protections against deportation for 350,000 Venezuelans who had been given Temporary Protected Status, which allows migrants to live and work legally in the US if their home country is deemed unsafe.
One of the highest-profile battles involves the deportation of a man living in Maryland, Kilmar Abrego-Garcia, to El Salvador over allegations he was a violent gang member.
A federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return, and that order was upheld by the US Supreme Court. However, Mr Abrego-Garcia remains in El Salvador, with the government arguing in court that it cannot compel the other country to take action, even though Trump has said in an interview that he ""could"" return Mr Abrego-Garica."

Babbitt was part of a group that smashed windows in an effort to enter the chamber of the House of Representatives while it was still in session, forcing lawmakers to delay certification and flee for safety.
Video of the incident shows her being shot in the shoulder after attempting to climb through a door. She later died in hospital.
The wrongful death lawsuit filed by Babbitt's family claimed that the decision to open fire by Capitol Police officer Michael Byrd was negligent, and that Babbitt's hands were in the air when she was shot. 
Family members say that Babbitt was motivated to come to the Capitol by Trump's claims of election fraud. No evidence has ever surfaced of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. 
Mr Byrd previously defended the move to fire his gun, saying the group of lawmakers and security ""were essentially trapped"" and had ""no way to retreat"".
In August 2021, a Capitol Police review found that Mr Byrd's decision saved lives and was consistent with police training and procedures. A justice department review also found no evidence of any police wrongdoing. 
""This is extremely disappointing and I completely disagree with the Department of Justice's decision,"" Chief Manger said in a statement to staff after learning of the settlement, the Washington Post reported. 
""This settlement sends a chilling message to law enforcement officers across our nation - especially those who have a protective mission like ours,"" he added.
In January, on his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants, including hundreds accused of assaulting police. He also fired the federal prosecutors who handled those cases. 
Trump in March told conservative news outlet Newsmax that he's ""a big fan of Ashli Babbitt"" and that she was ""innocently standing there"" when she was shot. 
""And a man did something unthinkable to her when he shot her, and I think it's a disgrace,"" he said, promising to ""look into"" the lawsuit brought by her family."

""Come home soon,"" Drake wrote on his Instagram story with a link to the petition. 
Lanez was stabbed 14 times by a fellow inmate in a California prison last week, an attack that caused both of his lungs to collapse. He was rushed to a hospital and is expected to recover. 
Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for shooting another musician, Megan Thee Stallion, in 2020.
The prison attack happened around 07:20 local time (15:20 GMT) on 12 May, said Pedro CalderÃ³n Michel of the state's corrections department.
 Staff began first aid before Lanez, 32, was taken to a local medical facility for further treatment, he said.
A post on Lanez's Instagram said he was stabbed in the back, torso, head and face and had to be temporarily placed on a breathing apparatus. He is now able to breathe on his own.
""Despite being in pain, he is talking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through,"" the post said.
Tory Lanez's trial for shooting Megan Thee Stallion was divisive. Here's how it played out
Rapper Tory Lanez stabbed 14 times in California prison attack
Convicted killer named as suspect in prison stabbing of rapper Tory Lanez
The prisoner suspected of the attack, Santino Casio, 41, is serving a life sentence for second-degree murder and other violent offences, officials told the BBC. They said he has been placed in ""restricted housing"" pending an investigation.
Casio arrived at the Tehachapi institution in February 2004, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR), and has received additional sentences for assaulting a fellow prisoner in 2008 and for possessing a deadly weapon in 2018.
Lanez was convicted of shooting Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, as they were leaving a 2020 pool party at reality star Kylie Jenner's Hollywood mansion.
The case divided the hip-hop world, with rappers - including 50 Cent and Iggy Azalea - appearing to take sides in the conflict and some asking the court for leniency at Lanez's sentencing.
Drake's song Circo Loco, a collaboration with 21 Savage, appeared to reference the case and imply that Megan lied about being shot. 
Megan, in turn, accused Drake of making jokes about assaulting a woman. 
The petition shared by Drake now has about 270,000 signatures calling on Gov Gavin Newsom to grant Lanez a ""full pardon"". The Change.org petition, created by the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety, also points to arguments questioning both evidence and witness accounts in the case. 
Newsom has not commented on the request. 
Lanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction. He has teased the release of a new album from prison titled Peterson."

Last week, he said that it would not be resolved until he and Russian President Vladimir Putin could ""get together"" and hash it out in person.
On Monday, the ground shifted again. 
After a two-hour phone call with Putin, he said that the conditions of a peace deal could only be negotiated between Russia and Ukraine â and maybe with the help of the Pope.
Still, the US president has not lost his sense of optimism about the prospect for peace, posting on social media that the combatants would ""immediately start"" negotiations for a ceasefire and an end to the war.
That sentiment was somewhat at odds with the Russian view. Putin only said that his country is ready to work with Ukraine to craft a ""memorandum on a possible future peace agreement"".
Talks about memorandums and a ""possible future"" of peace hardly seems the kind of solid ground on which lasting deals can be quickly built.
Russia and Ukraine to 'immediately' start ceasefire talks, says Trump
Trump says he will call Putin to discuss stopping Ukraine 'bloodbath'
Rosenberg: Trump-Putin call seen as victory in Russia
Putin again emphasised that any resolution would have to address the ""root causes"" of the war â which Russia has claimed in the past to be Ukraine's desire for closer ties to Europe.
On Truth Social after the call, Trump said that Russia and Ukraine will ""immediately start negotiations"" toward a ceasefire, adding that ""the conditions for that will be negotiated between the two parties"".
But there is a possibility that Trump's latest take on the war in Ukraine could be a sign that the US will ultimately abandon the negotiating table.
Later on Monday, Trump said he would not step away from brokering talks between the two countries, but acknowledged that he had a ""red line in his head"".
""Big egos involved, but I think something's going to happen,"" he said. ""And if it doesn't, I'll just back away and they'll have to keep going.""
Such a move, however, comes with its own set of questions â and risks.
If the US washes its hands of the war, as Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have also threatened, does it mean the US would also end any military and intelligence support for Ukraine? 
And if that is the case, then it may be a development that Russia, with its greater resources compared to a Ukraine cut off from American backing, would welcome.
That prospect is enough to have Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky concerned.
""It's crucial for all of us that the United States does not distance itself from the talks and the pursuit of peace,"" he said on Monday after the Trump-Putin call.
Trump's frantic peace brokering hints at what he really wants
Trump has expressed frustration with both Putin and Zelensky as efforts to resolve the three-year-old conflict drag on. 
He accused the Ukrainian leader of ""gambling with World War Three"" in an explosive meeting in February in the Oval Office and, in April, said he was ""very angry"" and ""pissed off"" at Putin after talks continued to stall.
Putting aside Monday's rhetoric, it appears that Ukraine and Russia are set to continue some kind of talks â and talking in any form is progress after nearly three years of war. Still to be determined is whether the Russian team will be more than the low-level delegation that travelled to Istanbul to meet with the Ukrainians last Friday.
Trump is holding out the promise of reduced sanctions on Russia â and new trade deals and economic investment â as the enticement that will move Putin toward a peace agreement. He mentioned that again in his post-call comments. Not discussed, on the other hand, were any negative consequences, such as new sanctions on Russian banking and energy exports.
The US president last month warned that he would not tolerate Putin ""tapping me along"" and said that Russia should not target civilian areas. But yesterday, Russia launched its largest drone strike of the war on Ukrainian cities, and Monday's call between the two world leaders makes clear that any ceasefire or peace deal still seems well over the horizon."

Searches are continuing at an Irish farm where partial human remains were found.
The discovery on Friday was made almost two months after County Kerry farmer, Michael Gaine, went missing.
Police had been questioning a man in his 50s on suspicion of murder but he has now been released without charge.
A process to formally identify the partial human remains is under way.
The ongoing search at the farm near Kenmare is being led by specialist teams.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) are being supported by an engineering specialist search team from the Irish Defence Forces.
Mr Gaine was reported missing from his home on Friday 21 March.
It was initially treated as a missing persons case before being upgraded to a homicide on 29 April.
Tributes have been left close to Michael Gaine's farm
There was always a sense of foreboding after Mr Gaine vanished in March.
His disappearance was one of those times when many people got an early feeling that ""something is not right"" about the case.
But nothing could have prepared the farmer's family and his community for the grim discovery of partial human remains on land beside his farm almost two months after he went missing.
People who knew Mr Gaine have been left reeling by how the discovery was made last Friday during the spreading of slurry across fields.
The shock was compounded by follow-up searches for more body parts in the fields and in a slurry tank on the adjoining farm.
The gruesome developments have rocked the community and sent shockwaves around Ireland.
The country was gripped by the original disappearance of the busy and popular sheep and cattle farmer in a mountainous area close to Moll's Gap, along the world-renowned Ring of Kerry tourist route.
He was reported missing a day after he made an early morning trip to a shop in the nearby town of Kenmare.
His car was found at his farm, which is at a separate location to his home, and some of his personal items were in the car.
But there was no trace of the farmer.
That prompted an extensive search for miles around the rugged and remote terrain where he lived and worked.
Initially, hundreds of people joined police along with search and rescue teams as they combed the area trying to find Mr Gaine or any clues about his whereabouts.
GardaÃ­ then requested the community to step back from the search to allow more space for investigators and search and rescue experts.
That prompted immediate speculation that this might ultimately turn-out to be more than a missing person case.
Irish Defence Forces are assisting with the search
Towards the end of April, there was confirmation that the investigation had been upgraded to homicide.
That meant GardaÃ­ believed Mr Gaine was dead and someone else was involved.
But there was still no breakthrough until last Friday.
A machine was being used to spread slurry on fields beside his farm when the operator was stunned to discover what appeared to be parts of human remains.
The alarm was raised, and the lands and farm were sealed off and declared a crime scene to allow for forensic searches in the fields and in a slurry tank on the farm.
It is well known that the slurry facility on the farm was searched during the early stages of Mr Gaine's disappearance.
Some people are now wondering if the search teams missed the body parts during their initial searches or if the body or partial remains were deposited there more recently.
It is a complex and challenging investigation, and it therefore likely to be some time before investigators have all the answers about what happened to Mr Gaine."

The UK and the EU have struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas still up for negotiation.
A key part of the deal involves giving European fishing boats a further 12 years of access to British waters in exchange for easing some trade frictions.
It marks the biggest reboot since the UK officially left the EU in 2020 and comes after years of disagreements over Brexit.
The Conservatives and Reform UK have described the deal as a ""surrender"" to the EU, while the Liberal Democrats said the government had taken some ""positive first steps"" to rebuilding ties with Europe.
The agreement was finalised late on Sunday, ahead of a summit involving EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa in London on Monday.
""It's time to look forward,"" Sir Keir said at the summit.
""To move on from the stale old debates and political fights to find common sense, practical solutions which get the best for the British people.
""We're ready to work with partners if it means we can improve people's lives here at home.""
At a news conference, European Commission President von der Leyen described the summit as a ""historic moment"" that was only possible ""thanks to the leadership"" of Sir Keir.
""We're turning a page,"" she said. ""We're opening a new chapter in our relationship.""
The president said the deal would make ""a real difference to people in the UK and across our union"" at a time of global instability.
Brexitcast: The EU-UK Deal (and our Rachel Reeves interview)
The government said the deal would make it easier for food and drink to be imported and exported by reducing paperwork and checks.
Some routine checks on animal and plant products will be removed completely, the government said.
In return, the UK will give the EU access to its fishing waters until 2038 - a 12-year extension of arrangements already in place.
One diplomatic source said it amounted to a rollover of the existing terms agreed as part of the revised withdrawal agreement negotiated by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in 2019.
The text of the deal says: ""We note the political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038 and extending energy cooperation on a continuous basis.""
The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights, which gave EU boats continued access to UK waters, was set to expire at the end of June 2026.
The UK government has also unveiled a Â£360m investment fund in coastal communities and the fishing industry.
Fishing only accounts for an estimated 0.04% of UK GDP, but British control over its fishing waters was a big issue in the Brexit campaign.
Defending the agreement, Sir Keir said it would allow British fishing communities to ""sell more easily into the European market"" and give them ""stability over the long term"".
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the 12-year deal on access for European boats ""will be the end of the fishing industry"".
Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister ""must ignore the naysayers and dinosaurs in Reform and the Conservative Party and be more ambitious in getting the best deal in the national interest"".
Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said giving the EU access to British waters for 12 years ""was three times longer than the government wanted"".
""We're becoming a rule-taker from Brussels once again,"" she said.
The deal requires the UK to follow rules set by Brussels in areas covering food trade, emissions trading and potential co-operation in the electricity market.
Known as dynamic alignment, this arrangement would mean the UK giving the European Court of Justice a role in any trading disputes.
In a post on X, external, Johnson said under this ""sell out of a deal the UK will have to accept EU law on a host of measures from food standards to emissions trading"".
He said Sir Keir had agreed that the UK ""will once again be paying countless millions of pounds into EU coffers - for the privilege of becoming the non-voting punk of the EU Commission"".
The prime minister's spokesperson said payments to the EU in relation to the deals on agricultural products and energy were ""not big"", but not did confirm the costs.
The government said there was a difference between these ""administrative costs"" and the payments required to be part of EU programmes, which would be part of future negotiations.
A security pact is also central to the agreement, as European nations come under pressure to invest more in defence to support Ukraine as it faces Russia's full-scale invasion.
The agreement paves the way for the UK to participate in the EU's proposed new Â£150bn defence fund, opening up opportunities for UK arms firms to bid for defence contracts.
The government said British businesses will not be hit by an EU carbon tax due to come in next year, under plans to link emissions-trading schemes.
The agreements on trade and energy would add nearly Â£9bn to the UK economy by 2040, the government estimated.
Other announcements include:
Further co-operation on a youth mobility scheme. The scheme, which would be capped and time-limited, would mirror existing schemes the UK has with countries such as Australia and New Zealand
A commitment to work towards the UK joining the Erasmus programme, an EU initiative that provides funding for student exchanges and training across Europe
Allowing British travellers to use more passport e-gates - automated self-service barriers at European airports
Working more closely together on developing energy networks, especially in the North Sea, and exploring the possibility of the UK joining the EU's internal electricity market
British steel exports will be protected from new EU rules and tariffs
More co-operation on tackling illegal migration, including sharing more intelligence.
The reset comes after years of ill-tempered relations between the UK and the EU over Brexit, which triggered one of the most tumultuous periods in British political history.
Since Labour took office last year, governments worldwide have been forced to rethink their relationships on trade and defence, in response to US President Donald Trump's policies and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Ministers believe there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit â membership of the single market and customs union.
Polling by YouGov suggests a majority of Britons now regret the Brexit vote and favour closer ties with the EU.
But the Labour government's reset of EU relations comes at a time when Reform UK - a Eurosceptic party - is leading in the polls.

The four-day conflict between arch-rivals India and Pakistan this month ended with a ceasefire and both claiming victory â but it now appears that China's defence industry might also be an unlikely winner.
The latest flare-up began on 7 May when India launched attacks on what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" inside Pakistan in response to the brutal killing of 26 people, mostly tourists by militants in Pahalgam on 22 April.
Many of them were killed in the scenic valley in Indian-administered Kashmir in front of their wives and family members. Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups involved in the carnage, a charge Pakistan denied.
After India's response - which it called Operation Sindoor - to the militant attack, tit-for-tat military manoeuvres from both sides followed, involving drones, missiles and fighter jets.
India reportedly used its French and Russian-made jets, while Pakistan deployed its J-10 and J-17 aircraft, which Islamabad co-produces with Beijing. Both sides say their jets did not cross the border and they were firing missiles at each other from a distance. 
Islamabad claims that its fighter aircraft shot down at least six Indian planes, including the newly-acquired French-made Rafale fighter jets. Delhi hasn't responded to these claims.
""Losses are a part of combat,"" Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force (IAF) said last week when a reporter asked him about these claims. Air Marshal Bharti declined to comment on the specific claim of Pakistan downing Indian jets. 
""We have achieved the objectives that we selected, and all our pilots are back home,"" he added.
India said it had killed at least ""100 terrorists"" while targeting the headquarters of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed militant outfits based in Pakistan.
A definitive account of what really happened in the aerial battle is yet to emerge. Some media outlets reported, external plane crashes in the state of Punjab and Indian-administered Kashmir around the same time but the Indian government has not responded to the reports.
Pakistan claims to have shot down one of India's Rafale fighter jets
A Reuters report quoting American officials said Pakistan possibly had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets. Pakistan claiming victory after hugely relying on Chinese weapons systems in an active combat situation is being seen by some experts as a boost for Beijing's defence industry but some also disagree with the claim.
Some of the experts have called this a ""DeepSeek moment"" for the Chinese weapons industry, referring to January this year when the Chinese AI start-up shook US giants with its cost-effective technology.
""The aerial fight was a big advertisement for the Chinese weapons industry. Until now, China had no opportunity to test its platforms in a combat situation,"" Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, told the BBC.
The Beijing-based analyst said the outcome of the air duel showed ""China has some systems that are next to none"". Shares in the Chinese Avic Chengdu Aircraft company, that manufactures fighter jets like the J-10, surged by up to 40% last week after the reported performance of the fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict.
Other experts, however, feel it's too early to declare the superiority of Chinese weapons systems.
Professor Walter Ladwig from the King's College in London said it was yet to be determined whether the Chinese jets had actually outmanoeuvred the Indian Air Force (IAF) planes, particularly the Rafale.
""In a standard military doctrine, you would suppress the enemy's air defences and get air superiority before you struck ground targets. Instead, it appears the IAF's mission was clearly not to provoke any Pakistani military retaliation,"" he said.
Mr Ladwig thought that the Indian pilots were given instructions to fly despite the fact that the entire Pakistani air defence was on high alert and their jets were already in the sky. The IAF hasn't given details of the mission or about its air operations strategy.
Beijing also hasn't made any comment on reports of the J-10 taking down Indian fighter jets, including the Rafale. But unconfirmed reports of the J-10 bringing down a Western weapon system has triggered jubilation and triumphalism on Chinese social media.
Carlotta Rinaudo, a China researcher at the International Team for the Study of Security in Verona, said Chinese social media was flooded with nationalistic messages even though it's difficult to reach a conclusion with the available information.
""At the moment perception matters way more than reality. If we see it in that way, the main winner is really China,"" she said.
For China, Pakistan is a strategic and economic ally. It is investing more than $50bn (Â£37bn) to build infrastructure in Pakistan as part of its China-Pakistan Economic corridor.
So, a weak Pakistan is not in China's interest.
Pakistan's Air Force uses China-made J-10C fighter jets
China made a critical difference in the latest India-Pakistan conflict, says Imtiaz Gul, a Pakistani security analyst. ""It took the Indian planners by sheer surprise. They didn't probably envision the depth of co-operation in the modern warfare between Pakistan and China,"" he said.
Experts say the performance of the Chinese jets in a real combat situation was keenly analysed in Western capitals as this will have cascading impact on global arms trade. The US is the world's largest arms exporter, while China is the fourth.
China sells weapons mostly to developing countries like Myanmar and Pakistan. Previously the Chinese weapon systems were criticised for their poor quality and technical problems.
Reports said the Burmese military grounded, external several of its JF-17 fighter jets â jointly manufactured by China and Pakistan in 2022 â due to technical malfunctions.
The Nigerian military reported several technical problems, external with the Chinese made F-7 fighter jets.
Another point to be noted is that this was not the first time that India lost an aircraft to Pakistan.
In 2019, during a brief air battle between the two sides following similar Indian air strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, a Russian-made MiG-21 jet was shot down inside Pakistani territory and the pilot was captured. He was released a few days later. 
India, however, said that the pilot had ejected after successfully shooting down Pakistani fighter jets, including a US-made F-16. Pakistan has denied the claim.
Despite reports of the downing of Indian jets last week, experts like Mr Ladwig argue that India was able to hit an ""impressive breadth of targets"" inside Pakistan early in the morning of 10 May and this fact has gone largely unnoticed by the international media.
The Indian military said in a co-ordinated attack, it launched missiles on 11 Pakistani air bases across the country, including the strategic Nur Khan air base outside Rawalpindi, not far from the Pakistani military headquarters. It's a sensitive target that took Islamabad by surprise.
One of the furthest targets was in Bholari, 140km (86 miles) from the southern city of Karachi.
Mr Ladwig says this time the IAF operated with standard procedures - first attacking Pakistani air defence and radar systems and then focusing on ground targets. 
The Indian jets used an array of missiles, loitering munitions and drones despite the Pakistanis operating the Chinese-provided HQ 9 air defence system.
""It seems the attacks were relatively precise and targeted. The craters were in the middle of runways, exactly the ideal spot. If it were a longer conflict, how long would it take the Pakistani Air Force to get these facilities up and running again, I can't say,"" Mr Ladwig pointed out.
Nevertheless, he said, by refusing to get into the details of the mission briefing, India's military ""lost control of the narrative thread"".
Site of the Pahalgam attack where 26 civilians were shot dead by militants
In response to the Indian strikes, Pakistan said it launched missile and air strikes on several Indian forward air bases, but Delhi said the attacks caused no damage to equipment and personnel.
Realising that the situation was getting out of control, the US and its allies intervened and put pressure on both countries to stop the fighting.
But for India, experts say, the whole episode is a wake-up call.
Beijing may not comment on the details of the recent India-Pakistan conflict, but it's keen to show that its weapon systems are fast catching up with the West.
Delhi is aware that the jets China has supplied to Pakistan are some of the earlier models. Beijing has already inducted the more advanced J-20 stealth fighter jets, that can evade radars.
India and China have a long-standing border dispute along the Himalayas and fought a brief border war in 1962 that resulted in a defeat for India. A brief border clash took place in Ladakh in June 2020.
Experts say India is acutely aware that it needs to accelerate investments in its homegrown defence manufacturing industry and speed up international buying.
For now, China's defence industry seems to be enjoying the limelight following the claims of success of one of its aircraft in the India-Pakistan conflict.

Israel says it has allowed five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid, including baby food, into the Gaza Strip after 11 weeks of blockade.
The UN's humanitarian chief welcomed the move but stressed it was only ""a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed"" by the 2.1 million Palestinians in the war-torn territory, where global experts are warning of a looming famine.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his decision to temporarily let in a ""minimal"" amount of food followed pressure from allies in the US Senate.
""We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he stressed in a video in response to criticism of the move in Israel.
Netanyahu said food deliveries would continue only until the Israeli military and private companies had set up hubs to distribute aid under a US-backed plan rejected by the UN.
He also declared that Israeli forces would ""take control of all areas"" of Gaza as part of the expanded ground offensive against Hamas that the Israeli military began on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes killed at least 40 people across the territory on Monday, according to first responders and hospitals.
One strike reportedly killed five people at a school being used as a shelter for displaced families in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza.
The Israeli military said it struck ""Hamas terrorists"" who were operating inside a command-and-control centre in the area.
It also ordered the evacuation of the southern city of Khan Younis and its eastern suburbs, warning residents that it was about to launch an ""unprecedented attack"" there.
Israel stopped all deliveries of humanitarian aid and commercial supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
It said the steps were meant to put pressure on the armed group to release the hostages still held in Gaza.
The resumed Israeli bombardment and ground operation have reportedly killed more than 3,000 people and displaced 400,000 others, while the UN says the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
Last week, the Hamas-run health ministry reported 57 children had died from the effects of malnutrition over the past 11 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned half a million people faced starvation.
The UN said Israel was obliged under international humanitarian law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israeli officials said there was no shortage of aid because thousands of lorry loads had gone into Gaza during the ceasefire. They accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group denied.
But after pressure from Israel's allies increased, the Israeli prime minister's office announced on Sunday night it would ""allow a basic quantity of food to be brought in for the population in order to make certain that no starvation crisis develops in the Gaza Strip"".
Israeli right-wing politicians and activists were quick to assail the abrupt policy change. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called it ""a grave mistake"" that would ""fuel Hamas and give it oxygen while our hostages languish in tunnels"".
In a video posted on social media on Monday in response to the criticism, Netanyahu did not make humanitarian arguments when he explained the decision to let in some food.
""Since the beginning of the war, we said that in order to achieve victory - to defeat Hamas and to free all our hostages, two missions that are intertwined - there is one necessary condition: We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he said.
He said he had blocked aid deliveries via the UN and other humanitarian organisations because of looting by Hamas, and he was now pursuing a ""different method"" involving a US-backed non-governmental organisation, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, distributing aid from hubs protected by security contractors and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
However, he warned a ""red line"" was now approaching and ""our best friends in the world, [US] senators whom I know as passionate supporters of Israel"", had voiced concerns.
""They come to me and say this: 'We're giving you all the support to achieve victory... But there's one thing we cannot accept. We cannot handle images of starvation'.""
""And so, in order to achieve victory, we must somehow solve this problem. Until we establish those distribution points, and until we build a sterile area under IDF control for distributing food and medicine, we need to provide a minimal, basic bridge - just enough to prevent hunger,"" he added.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, another far-right leader, sought to smooth over the decision by urging the Israeli public to focus on the big picture.
Smotrich - who advocates building new Israeli settlements in Gaza - said the military offensive was meant to force Palestinians to the south of the territory ""and from there, with God's help, to third countries"", permanently displacing them.
On Monday, Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada, said the decision to allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza was ""wholly inadequate"". 
In a joint statement, they said: ""If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.""
Netanyahu responded with a statement accusing the three leaders of asking Israel to ""end a defensive war for our survival"", saying that, by doing so, they were ""offering a huge prize"" for the 7 October attacks while ""inviting more such atrocities"". 
""Israel accepts President Trump's vision and urges all European leaders to do the same,"" he added.
Around 115 of the 180 community kitchens in Gaza had been forced to shut down by last Wednesday due to the lack of supplies
On Monday evening, Israeli military body Cogat announced five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid, including food for babies, had entered Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing ""following the recommendation of professional IDF officials and in accordance with the directive of the political echelon"".
The UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, said it was a ""welcome development"" that Israeli authorities had allowed it to resume delivery of limited aid, and said nine of its trucks had been cleared to enter via the Kerem Shalom crossing.
""But it is a drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed, and significantly more aid must be allowed into Gaza, starting tomorrow morning,"" he warned.
He also said Israel had reassured the UN its work would be facilitated through existing mechanisms and that he was ""determined that our aid reach those in greatest need, and that the risk of theft by Hamas or other armed groups is minimised"".
UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said none of the aid had been picked up at the designated zone inside Gaza because it was ""already dark"" and due to ""security concerns, we cannot operate in those conditions"", according to the AFP news agency.
The director general of the Israeli foreign ministry, Eden Bar Tal, earlier told reporters that ""in the coming days, Israel will facilitate the entry of dozens of aid trucks"".
A senior Israeli official meanwhile said preparations for the aid plan mentioned by Netanyahu would be completed in about a week - a claim that was questioned by the head of the US-based charity World Central Kitchen.
""This is not true. Will take weeks,"" chef JosÃ© AndrÃ©s wrote on X. ""This plan will leave Palestinians hungry. The new humanitarian foundation members should be ashamed of themselvesâ¦ We already have a system in place to feed all Palestinians with the help of Palestinians.""
UN and other aid agencies have said they have about 8,900 lorry loads of humanitarian aid already in position and ready to enter Gaza, as well as what Fletcher described as ""clear, principled and practical plan to save lives at scale"" and reduce looting.
They have also insisted they will not co-operate with the Israeli-US plan to distribute aid from hubs located mostly in the south of Gaza, saying it contradicts their fundamental humanitarian principles of impartiality, independence and neutrality.
They have warned it will practically exclude those with mobility issues, including those with disabilities and the elderly, force further displacement, expose thousands of people to harm, make aid conditional on political and military aims, and set an unacceptable precedent for aid delivery around the world.
A displaced Palestinian man living in the coastal al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis with his wife and two children, aged nine and two, said they were currently able to eat one meal a day thanks to ""significant rationing"".
""Getting access to food, medicine and hygiene products has become extremely difficult - almost impossible - due to the shortage of these items and their high prices if they are available,"" Abd al-Fatah Hussein told the BBC in a message.
Mohammed Abu Rijleh meanwhile said his charity, Shabab Gaza (Gaza Youth), had been able to distribute only around 2,500 meals on Monday - far fewer than usual.
He told the BBC by telephone it had been a struggle to find ingredients to cook, forcing him to buy them at high prices from local markets.
Netanyahu also said Israeli forces were engaged in ""massive fighting"" in Gaza and were making progress.
""We are going to take control of all areas of the Strip, that's what we're going to do,"" he said.
He said the ""main objective"" of the expanded offensive was to defeat Hamas and that it would lead to the release of the 58 remaining hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
On Sunday, IDF spokesman Brig Gen Effie Defrin said five divisions were involved in an operation that would include ""dividing the territory and distancing the population for its safety"". ""The only thing that can stop us is the return of our hostages,"" he added.
While negotiators for Israel and Hamas remain in Qatar, both sides say there has been no breakthrough in a new round of indirect talks on a ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,475 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 3,340 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry."

AmÃ©rica SÃ¡nchez, 20, and 23-year-old Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos were among the 277 crew members on board the Mexican Navy's sailing ship when its three masts snapped as they hit the bridge.
According to Mexican media, SÃ¡nchez was one of the cadets who was standing on top of the rigging at the time of the accident. 
Twenty-two other crew members were injured, three of them critically, the Mexican Navy said.
The commander of the Mexican Navy, Admiral Pedro Raymundo Morales, said all the crew members well enough to travel would be taken back to their homeland soon.
The body of AmÃ©rica SÃ¡nchez is scheduled to be transferred to the Naval Academy in her home state of Veracruz later on Monday.
Her mother, RocÃ­o HernÃ¡ndez, described the 20-year-old cadet as ""an exemplary daughter"" who was ""a dedicated student"" aiming to become a naval engineer. 
Standing before an impromptu altar adorned with flowers and photos of AmÃ©rica SÃ¡nchez dressed up for her ""quinceaÃ±era"", the party marking her 15th birthday, Ms HernÃ¡ndez paid tribute to her daughter. 
The body of AmÃ©rica SÃ¡nchez will be taken to her home town of Xalapa on Monday
""She was a warrior, a soldier who didn't give up, who always fought for her goals,"" she said, adding that her daughter only had one year left until her graduation.
""They [the Navy] will hold a private ceremony in her honour at the Veracruz Naval Academy for her and then I will bring her home,"" Ms HernÃ¡ndez said thanking all of her daughter's relatives, friends and teachers, whom she asked ""to remember her [AmÃ©rica]  with affection"".
In San Mateo del Mar, a coastal town in Oaxaca state, friends and relatives of Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos have also been paying their respects after the young cadet was confirmed as the second fatal victim of the crash.
His friends told local media that the 23-year-old had always dreamt of following in his father's footsteps and becoming a sailor.
Being on board the CuauhtÃ©moc, also known as ""Knight of the Seas"", had been his greatest wish, they recalled. 
""The sea saw him being born and the sea was a witness to his passing,"" one friend to media, adding that ""all of us who knew him will remember him as a role model of an intelligent youth"".
Friends said Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos had always dreamt of becoming a sailor
The investigation into how the accident happened is still under way.
""This is the start of a long process,"" Michael Graham of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said during a briefing on Monday. ""We will not be drawing any conclusions, we will not speculate.""
Mr Graham said there was ""no significant structural damage"" to the load-bearing elements of the Brooklyn Bridge.
His colleague, Brian Young, provided a preliminary timeline of events on the night of 17 May.
At 20:20 local time (00:20 GMT), the CuauhtÃ©moc backed away from Manhattan's Pier 17 with the assistance of a tug boat. It intended to sail south on the East River before heading out to sea, Mr Young said
After departing the pier, the ship's astern (backwards) motion and speed increased up to 6 knots
At 20:24 a radio broadcast was sounded requesting assistance from other tugboats in the area. It was followed by two other requests
At 20:24 and 45 seconds, the CuauhtÃ©moc's mast struck the underside of the bridge
At 20:27 the ship came to a stop
By 20:30, New York City police and firefighters arrived on the scene
New York police officials previously said it appeared that the CuauhtÃ©moc had lost power as it was leaving New York Harbour and was dragged towards Brooklyn Bridge by the current.
Its three masts, measuring more than 48m, hit the base of the bridge, which -according to the New York transport department's website - only has a clearance of  41.1m.
All three masts collapsed and video footage taken by bystanders shows some of the crew members dangling from the yards and sails.
Mr Graham said that his team would consider the status of the engine during their investigation.
""On behalf of the NTSB, I wish to express my most sincere condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in this terrible tragedy,"" he said.

Video shows ship crashing into Brooklyn Bridge
Mexico's Navy Secretary Raymundo Pedro Morales Ãngeles said in a statement the results of any investigation would be followed with ""total transparency and responsibility"".
The CuauhtÃ©moc left Acapulco, Mexico, on 6 April on a tour that included stops in New York and Aberdeen, Scotland, for the city's Tall Ships race in July."
295,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3jxp72mv2o,2025-05-19 18:48:32,"Huge challenges await new president of divided Romania,","Imagine having a president called Nicky.
That's what Romanians just voted for: a softly-spoken, slightly geeky mathematician who everyone refers to by his first name, Nicusor â or Nicky.
On Monday, hours after claiming victory in the elections, the new president picked up his daughter from school as usual. He's promised his children nothing will change.
But for Romania things looked very different this morning.
Nicusor Dan has been mayor of Bucharest since 2020 but until now he was little known beyond the capital. That's why his election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades.
But it was also the least extreme option for change.
Dan's opponent in the second-round vote was George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic who regularly dishes out public insults.
He's also banned from two neighbouring countries because he claims part of Ukraine and all of Moldova belong to Romania.
Simion won the first round with 41% of the vote but Dan caught up in the second, and then took over.
""This time, fear managed to defeat fury,"" is how political analyst Radu Magdin explains the shift, and points to a significant increase in turnout.
""Clearly a lot of people are angry in Romania and want to see radical change. But at the same time, we saw massive mobilization of the urban middle class who feared that the country could be taken backwards.
""It was a fear of what may happen if Simion and friends came to power.""
I've met plenty of Simion supporters in recent days.
When he turned up to vote on Sunday, a colourful crowd were there at the polling station to greet him. Some were in embroidered national dress and others had brought Romanian flags.
They tended to talk about God and the ""traditional values"" they think Simion represents. Two men told me their priority was to prevent the EU ""imposing"" same-sex marriage on Romania.
Other voters are drawn to Simion's ""Romania first"" rhetoric and promises of a better life.
""Nothing has been done for us, the working people, and I'm fed up,"" Liliana told me this week from behind a Bucharest market stall piled with apples.
She and her husband voted for Simion thinking he wouldn't be ""so corrupt"".
So when the results came in she was disappointed.
""I don't think Dan is capable of running a country. But what can we do if people don't want change and progress?"" Liliana shrugged.
""I think children came back to the villages and persuaded their parents against Simion. They scared them into voting for Dan.""
George Simion says he is ""a man of my people and represent change""
George Simion himself told me he was a patriot and a ""man of my people"". But as the campaign advanced, he made mistakes.
Outside the market, feeding pigeons with her children, Diana said she'd been planning to vote for Simion until she saw a video from Paris just before the elections.
Attempting to speak French, Simion had described President Macron as having ""dictatorial tendencies"" and said the country was run by ""the ayatollahs"".
""It wasn't okay to do that, to go there and talk so rudely to the French people,"" Diana thinks. ""It made me change my vote.""
Analyst Radu Magdin spots other errors, including aggressive blog posts and the moment when Simion insulted his rival, Dan, calling him ""autistic, poor guy"". 
""Other than that, he seemed to flee the public debate and went shaking hands in the pan-European radical right instead,"" Mr Magdin mentions, referring to meetings in Poland, France and Italy right before the vote.
""I would say there were many people who did not really appreciate that.""
For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling.
At the election street celebrations last night, as well as yelling the new president's name and cheering, people chanted their defiance: ""Russia, don't forget! Romania is not yours!""
They were referring to allegations that Russia interfered in their election back in November to boost the chances of far-right conspiracy theorist, Calin Georgescu.
When he came from nowhere to win the first round, the vote was annulled.
This weekend was a re-run, with Georgescu banned and Simion in his place. The two were often seen side-by-side, even on voting day.
But Georgescu's open sympathy for Russia â he once told me he admired Vladimir Putin â was a turn-off for many voters.
Nicusor Dan didn't only win because he was not Simion.
His voters liked what he stood for, including a future firmly within Europe.
When thousands surrounded his campaign headquarters last night to wait for him to claim victory, many brought EU flags. There was relief as well as excitement.
Before the election, young voters had told me they planned radical action if Simion won.
""So many friends say that they will leave Romania because our values do not align with him at all,"" politics graduate Sergiana told me in central Bucharest. ""I feel like in a year or two he would completely mess up our chances to stay in the EU.""
By contrast, Dan put relations with Europe at the heart of his campaign.
""It's better for the European way, for younger people and for Romania â because we get more EU funds, more development,"" another young voter, Catalin Petrosanu, approved.
""Also Nicusor is the smartest guy since the revolution. He knows how to do things.""
In the end, Dan's win was emphatic. But millions of Romanian voters chose a different way, different values. While hopes for the 'change' candidate are high, the challenges are huge and patience may be limited.
""In my view, this is the last chance for the mainstream political class to win an election on a 'Save Europe, Save Democracy' platform,"" Radu Magdin warns.
George Simion is just 38 and going nowhere; his nationalist AUR party are strong in parliament.
""Next time, it's 'bye bye' if these people do not do their job,"" the analyst says. ""Next time it could be somebody like Simion."""

The agreement covers a range of issues, including defence, fishing, the trade in food products and the ability of young people to move freely between the UK and the EU.
BBC Verify has gone through the deal, picking out the potential winners and losers.
Winner: UK food exporters to the EU who could see fewer checks 
Loser: People who don't want the UK to follow EU rules, as there are strings attached
Since Brexit, UK goods travelling to the EU â including food products â have faced new checks and extra paperwork.
Some items, such as UK exports of raw burgers and sausages, have been banned from entering the EU because they do not meet its strict import rules. 
UK food exports to the EU have fallen, external â with volumes in 2024 down 34% compared with 2019 â and the industry blames this partly on the added red tape. 
Now, both sides have agreed to work on a joint food safety agreement that could remove many of the current barriers.
If signed and fully implemented, it would reduce paperwork, ease checks, and could even lift bans on products like raw meats.
Food and drink exports to the EU in 2023 were worth Â£14bn, external, accounting for 57% of all the sector's overseas sales.
But the deal comes with conditions. The UK will need to follow future EU food standards â a system known as ""dynamic alignment"" â and accept that the European Court of Justice will have the final say in any disputes in this area.
The UK will also have to make a financial contribution. However it is currently unknown how much this will be and when it will be required. 
Winner: The EU - fishing vessels get 12 more years of access to UK waters
Loser: UK fishermen who wanted annual negotiations on fishing access 
Although fishing accounts for a very small part of the UK economy - just 0.04% of GDP in 2024, external - it is politically sensitive. 
The ""reset"" document notes ""political agreements leading to full reciprocal access to waters to fish until 30 June 2038"" - a 12-year extension to the current deal negotiated by Boris Johnson's Conservative government - and much longer than expected.
Under the existing agreement (due to expire in 2026), EU vessels get access to UK waters to fish - in return for transferring 25% of their fishing quota - the amount they are allowed to catch - to UK fleets.
Some UK fishing groups have criticised the existing deal and do not want to see it extended.
Elspeth Macdonald, who represents 450 fishing boats as chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says: ""This deal is a horror show for Scottish fishermen, far worse than Boris Johnson's botched Brexit agreement.""
She says the long-term deal takes away the industry's bargaining power in future talks and would prefer annual negotiations with the EU.
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says there will be ""no increase in the amount that the EU vessels can catch in British waters"" and says it will now be easier for UK fishermen to export their products.
In 2023, the UK exported Â£1.2bn of fish to the EU, external, around 70% of all fish exports.
Tavish Scott from Salmon Scotland, which represents salmon farming in Scotland, says the agreement to reduce checks would ""speed up the delivery of our premium salmon to market"".
Winner: Young people in the UK and EU who should - if this is confirmed - be able to work and study more freely between the two
Loser: Those who oppose an increase in net migration to the UK will point out that any mobility scheme could affect immigration figures, although this effect may be temporary
The details here are still to be confirmed, but the winners would be those young people from both the UK and EU who would be able to work and study more easily across Europe and Great Britain. Other youth mobility schemes have focused on people aged 18 to 30.
However, the impact of what is being called a ""youth experience scheme"" could be uneven.
Before Brexit more young people from the EU came to the UK than went the other way.
And, remember, Sir Keir has pledged to ""significantly"" reduce immigration levels in the coming years. So there's a  big question mark on what impact a UK-EU scheme could have on UK immigration levels.
Madeleine Sumption from Oxford University's Migration Observatory told BBC Verify that a scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, as new participants arrive.
However, she adds that if everyone left the UK when their visa expired, the long-term impact on migration levels would be minimal.
""If the UK is worried about the impact, it could phase in the scheme, where it gradually increases the quota. So as people leave, the quota could be raised rather than a big bang all come at once,"" she said.
Winner: British tourists may be able to use eGates at EU airports but we do not know which ones and from when
Loser: Those expecting to escape long queues this summer
As part of the agreement, UK nationals will be able to use eGates at EU airports, rather than having their passport manually checked by a border officer.
The government claims: ""British holidaymakers will be able to use more eGates in Europe, ending the dreaded queues at border control.""
However the text of the EU-UK agreement is less clear, only referring to the ""potential use of eGates where appropriate, external"". 
It is unlikely any change will be implemented by the summer, travel organisation Abta told BBC Verify.
Abta believes the deal clarifies that the EU countries can offer eGates to UK nationals once a new Entry/Exit System (EES) comes into effect in October.
EES is an automated IT system for registering all non-EU travellers for a short stay, each time they cross the EU's external borders.
Whether UK passengers will avoid a border guard altogether will depend on the technology at each border crossing, Abta says.
Winner: UK defence firms may get contracts from new EU rearmament fund
Loser: EU defence firms which hoped to get more of these revenues
The EU has established a Security Action for Europe fund (SAFE) with â¬150bn (Â£126bn) of loans, backed by the EU budget, to enable its member states to rearm. 
This was going to be spent on EU-based defence firms. The fund also allows for the involvement of a number of non-EU countries and could now be opened up to UK defence companies too. This would potentially allow EU firms to use the fund to buy kit from the UK.
The UK has a large defence manufacturing industry relative to many EU states and this sector directly employs about164,00 people, external in the UK.
Between 2020 and 2024, the UK was estimated by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, external to have accounted for around 3.6% of total global annual arms exports, making the UK the seventh largest national exporter.
Again, the detail is still being worked out here and we do not know when and exactly how the UK will participate in the fund.
What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

""We're turning a page,"" EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday after the bloc's first summit with the UK since Brexit. ""We're opening a new chapter.""
It is not the first page that has been turned in the post-Brexit period, but it is potentially the most significant.
The two sides have now struck a deal that covers fishing, trade, defence, energy and strengthening ties in a number of policy areas that are still up for negotiation.
For Brussels, this negotiation was a chance to bring Britain â a major defence power â closer in a time of geopolitical turbulence.
And to address what some member states see as irritating hangovers from Brexit.
For years, there was a ""don't touch it"" mentality when it came to taking a broad look at the Brexit settlement, according to one EU diplomat.
It all involved ""too much politics"" with fears it could all ""go wrong.""
Remember, up until the 2023 Windsor Framework agreement, London and Brussels were bogged down in a protracted dispute over trade arrangements for Northern Ireland.
Then, in 2024, a new government won power in the UK - the more EU-friendly Labour Party.
Officials in Brussels had long voiced exasperation â even distrust â with prior Conservative administrations, a party with a vocal Brexit-backing contingent.
Some Brexit supporters are now castigating a deal that they say amounts to a sell-out of sovereignty to EU bureaucrats.
The new UK-EU deal at a glance
Diplomats in Brussels, however, insist that this is a ""normalisation"" of relations between neighbours who still look at the world in a broadly similar way.
That being said, there was evident satisfaction in EU circles about locking in fishing quotas for 12 years.
When I checked with one diplomat about that detail, they initially replied with a smiley face emoji.
Another said: ""The deal is balancedâarguably with favourable terms for the EUâand simply shows that splendid isolation is not an option in today's climate.""
Of course, the EU will want to highlight its ""wins"" in a negotiation with a former member state who badly shook the bloc by leaving.
Nevertheless, coastal countries - notably France â will be happy at not having to endure annual fish quota talks, for now.
It was, in the end I'm told, quid pro quo. The EU got its fishing deal. In return, it'll be easier for UK businesses to export agri-food products â although that element hasn't been finalised.
Also yet to be ironed out are the plans for youth mobility â which would allow young people to study or work more easily between Britain and the EU.
That was a particularly important goal for countries like Germany, anxious to win better access to an English-speaking country with prestigious universities.
Another key point for Berlin was the new defence and security partnership.
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Donald Trump's unpredictable White House have ripped up the rules on European security.
Time has been something of a healer â but the events of recent years have also created a sense of urgency.
Better ties with Britain, which remains a major defence player, is a no-brainer â now more than ever â for mainland Europe as it tries to scale up investment and capabilities.
Nations like Germany â which only recently hit the 2% Nato spending target â are acutely aware that they have been left exposed by the dramatic global developments of recent years.
But, of course, most of this deal is an agreement in principle; a statement of intent on issues also ranging across cyber security, energy and migration.
""I think it's a good step,"" another EU diplomat told me. ""It's good to test the waters for practical cooperation and what can be done. Let's take it from there.""
There is still a watchful wariness in Brussels about Britain's fraught and divisive debate about relations with the EU.
All the specifics, which have yet to be negotiated, could stir up further political storms whether that's on political compromises or cost.
This ""reset"" may not change the big fundamentals of Brexit - the UK remains out of the single market and customs union- but it does commit London and Brussels to doing a lot more talking as they try to fill the many gaps that lie within this long list of ambitions.
That means there will be a greater volume of diplomatic traffic between the UK and the EU going forward.
Doing more business with Brussels inevitably means doing more talking. In that regard, today is just the beginning."

A Channel Islands business has signed a deal with the Kenyan government to enable staff to be recruited to work in the three UK Crown dependencies.  
The agreement between recruitment firm GR8 and the Kenyan government would pave the way for staff to be recruited to work in Jersey and Guernsey and on the Isle of Man, organisers said.
Leaders said the agreement would make it easier for east African hospitality, construction, childcare and health workers to fill vacancies in the Crown dependencies.
GR8 CEO Lee Madden signed a memorandum of understanding with Roseline Njogu, who heads Kenya's State Department for Diaspora Affairs, in a ceremony in Jersey.
A GR8 spokesperson said the company was now a strategic partner for recruiting Kenyans into the Crown dependencies, strengthening business links with the east African country.
Njogu said: ""We are inviting good employers to come and recruit from Kenya from the talent that we have that is abundant in IT, healthcare, education, engineering and so on.""
Njogu, who heads Kenya's State Department for Diaspora Affairs, is on an official visit to Jersey, alongside Kenyan politicians and senior government officials. 
During their visit, they will also meet the Minister for External Relations Ian Gorst and representatives from organisations including Highlands College, Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the Jersey Construction Council.
Minister for Sustainable Economic Development Kirsten Morel, said: ""I hope this partnership flourishes, ensuring that Jersey remains an attractive and welcoming place for overseas skilled workers from multiple industries to live and work.""
Lee Madden, the chief executive of GR8, said the agreement enabled them to speak on behalf of the Kenyan government in terms of recruitment.
He said the recruitment of hospitality staff from Kenya had been ""instrumental in solving the recruitment crisis that was three to four years ago"".
GR8 began working with partners in Kenya five years ago, starting a close business relationship with a college that saw trained hospitality workers brought over to help support businesses struggling to recruit staff following Brexit. 
Since then, it has recruited hundreds of skilled workers from sectors including hospitality, construction and health care sectors into roles in Jersey and Guernsey, with the majority coming from Kenya.

The United Nation's top court has sided with Equatorial Guinea in a row with Gabon over three islands in potentially oil-rich waters.
The two Central African countries have been arguing over the isles - Conga, MbaniÃ© and Cocoteros - since the early 1970s.
The islands are virtually uninhabited but are in a maritime zone thought to contain significant oil deposits.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Equatorial Guinea's claim - based on a 1900 treaty dividing up French and Spanish colonial assets - should be honoured.
The court dismissed Gabon's central argument - that a more recent treaty, the 1974 Bata convention, had switched the islands' sovereignty in its favour.
In a final and binding ruling, the ICJ said Conga, MbaniÃ© and Cocoteros were held by Spain, and then passed to its former colony Equatorial Guinea at independence in 1968.

Gabon will now have to remove its soldiers from MbaniÃ©, the largest of the islands.
In 1972, the Gabonese army drove Equatoguinean troops from MbaniÃ© and established its own military presence there.
Hostilities cooled until the early 2000s, when the prospect of oil in the Gulf of Guinea became apparent.
In 2016, following years of mediation by the United Nations, the two nations agreed to let the ICJ settle the matter.
A spokesperson for the Gabonese presidency said it was now down to the countries to negotiate in the light of the ruling, the AFP news agency reports.
""Gabon and Equatorial Guinea have to live side-by-side, we can't move away from each other. Therefore we will have to talk it over to solve all these problems,"" said Guy Rossatanga-Rignault.
Both countries are significant oil producers. However, they have experienced falling oil production in recent years due to underinvestment, insufficient exploration activity and ageing wells.

An Arabic statement shared by IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee said the area ""will be considered a dangerous combat zone"", adding: ""Terrorist organizations have brought you disaster. For your safety, evacuate immediately.""
The IDF launched a major new Gaza offensive on Friday named Operation Gideon's Chariots. Hospitals have said more than 100 people have been killed in the last 24 hours.
One woman from Khan Younis told the BBC that the new evacuation order - which also covers the areas of Bani Suhaila and Abasan - was her ""worst nightmare"". 
Among those who fled was Tasneem Barakeh, 13, who said the order was issued while her father was out searching for food and that they were forced to leave without him.
""Please God, let the war stop. Where is my father?"" she said. ""We don't know where he is. Please, just bring us my father.""
Abdallah Abu Shab, who also fled, said: ""They told us to go to Al-Mawasi, and here we are. What do we do?""
""There is no tent for us there or anything,"" he said, adding ""there isn't any transportation and people do not have money to ride a cart"". 
Another woman, who is already living under an evacuation order in central Gaza, said she would not move ""because there is no place to go"".
The IDF said the aim of its attack was to ""destroy the capabilities of terrorist organizations in this area"". 
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would ""take control"" of the whole of Gaza.
In a video posted on social media, he said: ""We are engaged in massive fighting - intense and substantial - and there is progress. 
""We are going to take control of all areas of the Strip, that's what we're going to do.""
The IDF said it had struck 160 targets across Gaza in the last 24 hours, including anti-tank positions, underground infrastructure and a weapons storage point.
One of the strikes killed seven at a school housing displaced families in Nuseirat, central Gaza, and three in a house in nearby Deir Al-Balah, the territory's Hamas-run health authority said.
Overnight, a warehouse containing medical supplies at the Nasser Hospital was hit by an Israeli strike, local Hamas-run health authorities reported.
British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians said the strike happened ""as Palestinians who were killed and wounded from other attacks were being brought to the hospital"".
""We are just seeing all our work being burned to ashes,"" a spokesman for the charity said.
Separately, Palestinian media reported that Israeli special forces troops dressed in women's clothing had entered a Khan Younis home undercover and killed one man on Monday morning, before arresting his wife and child.
Israeli media named him as Ahmad Sarhan, and reported he was a senior member of the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees - a Palestinian militant group allied with Hamas.
The IDF has previously said the expanded Gaza operations are aimed at ""achieving all the war's objectives"", including releasing hostages and ""the defeat of Hamas"".
But a group representing many of the hostage's families said the operation posed ""grave and escalating dangers"" to hostages still held in Gaza.
""Testimonies from released hostages describe significantly worsened treatment following military strikes, including physical abuse, restraint and reduced food,"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.
On Sunday, Israel announced it would allow a ""basic amount of food"" to enter Gaza to ensure that ""no starvation crisis develops"" after blockading the territory for 11 weeks.
Netanyahu said the decision to allow a ""minimal"" amount of food into Gaza followed pressure from allies in the US Senate.
""We must not reach a situation of famine, both from a practical and a diplomatic standpoint,"" he stressed in a video responding to criticism within Israel of the humanitarian situation. 
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 taken hostage.
Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Vance handed the pontiff a letter from President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump inviting him to visit ""as soon as [he] possibly can"", White House  spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.
In a statement, the Holy See said both sides had expressed satisfaction with relations between the US and Vatican during face-to-face talks on Monday.
The meeting comes after Vance - a practicing Catholic - joined other dignitaries and worshippers at the Pope's inaugural mass on Sunday.
Religious freedom and cooperation between church and state were also discussed  on Monday, it was reported, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also taking part. 
""Finally, there was an exchange of views on current international issues with a shared call for respect for humanitarian and international law in conflict zones, and support for negotiated solutions among the parties involved,"" reads the Holy See's statement. 
The papal audience lasted 45 minutes, Vance's spokesperson said. It took place behind closed doors without reporters present. 
There was a customary exchange of gifts, with Vance handing Pope Leo a t-shirt for the Chicago Bears - an American football team from the Pope's birthplace - complete with his name. Vance's office said he also gave the pontiff two books by St Augustine.
The Pope, meanwhile, gave the vice-president a bronze sculpture with the inscription ""peace is a fragile flower"" in Italian, and a picture book of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace - the Pope's official residence. 
The Vatican said Vance also held positive talks with Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, who is responsible for the Holy See's diplomatic relations.

Pope Leo, who became the first American to lead the Catholic Church earlier this month, has previously appeared to make veiled criticisms of Vance and the Trump administration's migration stance.
In February, an X account under Leo's name shared criticism of the White House's plans for mass deportations of migrants.
That same month, the account also shared a link to an opinion piece titled: ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.""
The Vatican has not responded to previous requests from BBC News to confirm whether the account belonged to Pope Leo.
On Sunday, Vance said the United States was ""very proud"" of the Chicago-born pontiff.
""Certainly our prayers go with him as he starts this very important work,"" the vice-president said."

South African authorities say they will continue with legal proceedings against Nigerian televangelist Timothy Omotoso who was acquitted of rape last month, even though he has left the country.
Mr Omotoso, who denied the 32 charges against him, was accused of sexually assaulting young women from his church in Port Elizabeth.
The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it will still appeal against the judgement which found Mr Omotoso not guilty, saying his presence is not required.
South Africa's Department of Home Affairs said Mr Omotoso had flown to Nigeria from OR Tambo International Airport, where he was filmed by public broadcaster SABC wearing a hoodie and dark sunglasses.
Mr Omotoso was first arrested in 2017 as he attempted to leave South Africa.
Among his accusers was a woman who said she was raped by the pastor when she was aged 14.
In a statement, South African prosecutors accepted ""there are no legal grounds to prevent"" Mr Omotoso from leaving the country following his acquittal.
However, if the appeal were allowed, the authorities would apply for Mr Omotoso to be extradited back to South Africa, the statement added, highlighting South Africa's ""bilateral extradition treaty with Nigeria"". 
After his acquittal in April, Mr Omotoso also faced immigration issues, with the Department of Home Affairs alleging earlier this month, external that he was in South Africa illegally.
On Sunday, the department issued a statement saying that Mr Omotoso had been classified as an ""undesirable person"", meaning he will not be able to return to the country for five years.
South Africa's public broadcaster reports that the pastor left the country voluntarily. 
The BBC has contacted the NPA for clarity on how any potential extradition process could work given Mr Omotoso's status as an ""undesirable person"".
Mr Omotoso leads the Jesus Dominion International church which has branches in the UK, Nigeria, France and Israel as well as in many parts of South Africa, according to its website. 
Mr Omotoso's trial made South African history as the first high-profile rape case to be broadcast live.

A sweeping US tax and spending bill has overcome days of Republican conflict to advance through a key committee and move one step closer to a full vote in the House.
Four hard-line Republican congressmen - who had previously torpedoed progress due to concerns the cuts were not deep enough to reduce the national debt - allowed the bill to go forward on Sunday night.
They voted ""present"" rather than against the legislation, giving House Speaker Mike Johnson a rare win. But their lack of explicit support points to a bumpy road ahead before the party unites.
The bill would extend tax cuts from President Donald Trump's first term, end taxes on tips and increase military and border spending.
These would be partly paid for by cuts to Medicaid and green subsidies.
Johnson said he expected the Rules Committee to take up the bill on Tuesday or Wednesday, and for the legislation to advance to a floor vote later in the week.
One of the conservative rebels, Chip Roy of Texas, said the hard-liners had received concessions from the leadership that the bill would change in their favour, adding: ""The bill does not yet meet the moment.""
They want Americans to face stricter work requirements before they can receive Medicaid, and an end to clean energy subsidies introduced under the previous president, Democrat Joe Biden.
Four sticking points in Trump's 'big, beautiful' bill
The other flank of the Republican Party is also unhappy, with a provision in the bill that triples the local tax deduction from $10,000 (Â£7,500) to $30,000 for couples.
A group of moderates from states with high taxes, like New York and California, have objected because they want a higher cap.
Analysts suggest the bill could add $3-5tn to the national debt, which is above $35tn and climbing.
Influential ratings firm Moody's cited the rising debt as a factor when it downgraded its US credit rating on Friday.
If the bill passes the House when put to the floor, it will then go to the Senate for passage before it ends up on the president's desk."

Two runners are preparing to take part in a 230km (140-mile) ultra-marathon in the Amazon rainforest.
James March from Wolverhampton and Greg Garner from Newcastle-under-Lyme will set off next month to compete in Beyond the Ultimate Jungle Ultra in Peru over five days.
To prepare for the conditions, the pair have been using an environmental chamber at the University of Wolverhampton to acclimatise to the intense heat and humidity of the rainforest.
""The combination of heat, humidity and altitude provides a unique challenge, and it's clear why people consider it one of the toughest physical challenges on the planet,"" Mr March said.
Participants will have to navigate jungle and rainforest amid heat, humidity and mud within the UNESCO World Heritage site of Manu National Park. 
Competitors could also be running at night while carrying their essential supplies.
Using the equipment at the university's Walsall campus has been an integral part of their training, 23-year-old Mr March, who is raising money for Walkoncemore, a charity that supports people living with MS, said.
The pair will spend five days competing in the event in Peru
The facility can replicate virtually any climate, the university said, and has been mimicking the necessary temperature, humidity, and altitude, enabling the men to optimise their training for the specific challenges.
""The environmental chamber goes up to 40 degrees and 90% humidity, which helps us prepare and understand how our bodies react to these temperatures,"" Mr March said.
""It's so important to get your body used to performing in these conditions, and we have access to expertise from Dr Cloak and his colleagues to help us with any questions or support we need.
""The chamber is perfect to be able to prepare for such races â it really puts it in perspective, not just how hot it's going to be but how we need to look after ourselves once we get out there.""
Students studying sport and exercise science at the university have been involved in the training by measuring the pair's weight and heart rates while tracking performance and health and safety.
Ross Cloak, associate professor in sport and exercise science, said: ""It's been a fantastic couple of weeks supporting James and Greg as they prepare for this epic challenge.
""They are raising money for a fantastic cause, and we, in the School of Sport, were more than happy to get involved.""

Fierce Nigerian political rivals Peter Obi and President Bola Tinubu were seen laughing and joking at Pope Leo XIV's inaugural mass in Rome.
Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress defeated Obi of the Labour Party in the heated and tightly contested 2023 presidential election - a victory Obi challenged at the Supreme Court without success.
The pair's supporters have expressed bitter rivalry towards each other over the years, both on social media and on the streets, with some physical clashes occurring prior to the elections.
Tinubu and Obi are expected to go head-to-head again in less than two years' time as Nigeria prepares for another election in 2027.
Photos of the meeting were shared by presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga on social media, who recounted what transpired when Obi and a former governor greeted the Nigerian president after seeing him at the event.
""Mr President, welcome to our church, and thank you for honouring the Pope with your presence,"" said former Ekiti state governor Kayode Fayemi.
Both Obi and Fayemi are Catholics, while Tinubu is Muslim.
However, President Tinubu responded: ""I should be the one welcoming you and Peter. I'm the head of the Nigerian delegation.""
The president's response elicited laughter from Obi, who agreed.
""Yes, indeed. We are members of your delegation,"" Obi said.
Despite the memorable encounter, Obi did not mention it in his long post on X about his visit to the Vatican.
Alkassim Hussain, a member of Nigeria's House of Representatives, told the BBC that the light-hearted meeting was good for the country's politics and should help reduce tension.
""They portrayed a good image of the country and that's how politics should be played - without bitterness.
""I hope supporters of both Tinubu and Obi can see that after elections and court cases, then it is all about the country and how everyone can join hands together to grow it,"" he noted.
Tinubu won the 2023 elections after the opposition was split between the Labour Party and the Peoples Democratic Party.
There is speculation that the two parties could form a coalition in 2027 to challenge Tinubu, who is expected to seek a second term.
Elections are often marred by violence in Nigeria, with hundreds of people losing their lives since the country's return to democracy in 1999.

The discovery was made on Friday after he reported urinary symptoms which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate.
The cancer is a more aggressive form of the disease and Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options, the statement said.
He left office in January as the oldest serving US president in history and questions about his health dogged his first term, leading him to end his run for re-election late in his campaign. 
In Sunday's statement, Biden's office said: ""Last week, President Joe Biden was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. 
""On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterised by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone. 
""While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management.""
A Gleason score of nine means his illness is classified as ""high-grade"" and the cancer cells could spread quickly, according to Cancer Research UK. 
After news broke of his diagnosis, the former president received support from both sides of the aisle. 
President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he and First Lady Melania Trump were ""saddened to hear about Joe Biden's recent medical diagnosis"".
""We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family,"" he said, referring to former First Lady Jill Biden. ""We wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.""
Analysis: Cancer diagnosis is another formidable challenge
What we know about the prostate cancer diagnosis
Former Vice-President Kamala Harris, who served under Biden, wrote on X that she and her husband Doug Emhoff are keeping the Biden family in their prayers.
""Joe is a fighter â and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership,"" Harris said.
In a post on X, Barack Obama â  who served as president from 2009 to 2017 with Joe Biden as his deputy â  said that he and his wife Michelle were ""thinking of the entire Biden family"". 
""Nobody has done more to find breakthrough treatments for cancer in all its forms than Joe, and I am certain he will fight this challenge with his trademark resolve and grace. We pray for a fast and full recovery,"" Obama said. In 2016, Obama tasked Biden with leading a ""cancer moonshot"" government-wide research programme.
In the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: ""I am very sorry to hear President Biden has prostate cancer. All the very best to Joe, his wife Jill and their family, and wishing the president swift and successful treatment.""
Joe Biden photographed speaking last month at a conference in Chicago
The news comes nearly a year after the former president was forced to drop out of the 2024 US presidential election over concerns about his health and age. 
Biden, then the Democratic nominee vying for re-election, faced mounting criticism of his poor performance in a June televised debate against Republican nominee and current president Donald Trump. 
He was replaced as the Democratic candidate by his vice-president, Kamala Harris.
Trump, 78, became the oldest person to take the oath when he took over from Biden.
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer affecting men, behind skin cancer, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that 13 out of every 100 men will develop prostate cancer at some point in their lives.
Age is the most common risk factor, the CDC says. 
Dr William Dahut, the Chief Scientific Officer at the American Cancer Society and a trained prostate cancer physician, told the BBC that the cancer is more aggressive in nature, based on the publicly-available information on Biden's diagnosis.
""In general, if cancer has spread to the bones, we don't think it is considered a curable cancer,"" Dr Dahut said. 
He noted, however, that most patients tend to respond well to initial treatment, ""and people can live many years with the diagnosis"". 
Dr Dahut said that someone with the former president's diagnosis will likely be offered hormonal therapies to mitigate symptoms and to slow the growth of cancerous cells. 
Biden had largely retreated from the public eye since leaving the White House and he has made few public appearances. 
In May, he sat down for an interview with the BBC - his first since leaving the White House - where he admitted that the decision to step down from the 2024 race was ""difficult"". 
Biden has faced questions about the status of his health in recent months.
In an appearance on The View programme that also took place in May, Biden denied claims that he had been experiencing cognitive decline in his final year at the White House. ""There is nothing to sustain that,"" he said.  
For many years, the president had advocated for cancer research. 
In 2022, he and Mrs Biden relaunched the ""cancer moonshot"" initiative with the goal of mobilising research efforts to prevent more than four million cancer deaths by the year 2047. 
Biden himself lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015."

France will build a new high-security prison in its overseas territory of French Guiana to house drug traffickers and radical Islamists, the country's justice minister announced during a visit to the territory.
GÃ©rald Darmanin told Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper that the prison would target organised crime ""at all levels"" of the drug supply chain.
The â¬400m (Â£337m) facility, which could open as early as 2028, will be built in an isolated location deep in the Amazon jungle in the northwestern region of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni.
The plan was announced after a series of violent incidents linked to criminal gangs which saw prisons and staff targeted across France in recent months.
The prison will hold up to 500 people, with a separate wing designed to house the most dangerous criminals. 
In an interview with JDD, the minister said the new prison would be governed by an ""extremely strict carceral regime"" designed to ""incapacitate the most dangerous drug traffickers"".
Darmanin said the facility would be used to detain people ""at the beginning of the drug trail"", as well as serving as a ""lasting means of removing the heads of the drug trafficking networks"" in mainland France.
French Guiana is a region of France on the north-east coast of South America. Its residents are eligible to vote in French elections and have access to the French social security system, as well as other subsidies.
Its distance from the French mainland means drug lords ""will no longer be able to have any contact with their criminal networks"", Darmanin told JDD.
French authorities have long struggled to control the infiltration of mobile phones into the prison network. Tens of thousands are known to circulate through French jails.
Earlier this year, the French government announced new legislation designed to crack down on the activity of criminal gangs.
The measures will create a dedicated branch of the prosecutors' office to deal with organised crime. It will also introduce extra powers for investigators, and a special protected status for informers.
It will also see the creation of new high-security prisons - including the facility in French Guiana - to hold the most powerful drugs barons, with stricter rules governing visits and communication with the outside world.
France has seen a series of attacks on prisons in recent months, which Darmanin has described as ""terrorist"" incidents that come in response to the government's new legislation.
The perpetrators of these attacks have set vehicles outside prisons alight, while Toulon's La Farlede prison was hit by gunfire.
In some incidents the perpetrators of these attacks have styled themselves as defenders of prisoners' rights.
The proposed new facility in French Guiana is to be built at a ""strategic crossroads"" for drugs mules, particularly from Brazil and Suriname, according to AFP news agency.
Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni is the former port of entry to the infamous Devil's Island penal colony, where 70,000 convicts from mainland France were sent between 1852 and 1954.
The penal colony was the setting of French writer Henri CharriÃ¨re's book Papillon, which was later made into a Hollywood film starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.
The BBC has contacted the French justice ministry for comment."

Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski won a narrow victory in Poland's presidential election, but a second-round run-off with conservative historian Karol Nawrocki will be required to decide the country's next president.
The state electoral commission (PKW) said Trzaskowski, a deputy leader of prime minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Platform (PO) party, won 31.3% of the vote.
Nawrocki came second with 29.5% of the vote.
Final official results are not expected until later on Monday. Turnout was over 67%.
Trzaskowski and Nawrocki are now set to compete in a second-round on 1 June as none of the 13 candidates won more than 50% of the vote.
LIVE: Follow the latest from elections in Romania, Portugal and Poland
Trzaskowski told his supporters at a rally in Sandomierz, southern Poland: ""We're going to win."" But he said a lot of work and ""great determination"" would be needed.  
""I'm convinced that all Poland will win,"" he said.
He pledged to cooperate with prime minister Tusk's coalition to liberalise the country's strict abortion law and accelerate reform of the Polish judiciary, which was widely seen to have been politicised by the previous PiS-led government.
Trzaskowski performed worse than opinion polls predicted before the vote, which had him between 4%-6% ahead of Nawrocki.
Poland's president has largely ceremonial powers but he or she is able to veto government legislation. Tusk's coalition does not have a big enough parliamentary majority to overturn a presidential veto.
Tusk has failed to deliver many of his campaign promises, partly because the incumbent conservative president Andrzej Duda has vetoed his government's legislation, but also due to divisions within the coalition over issues like abortion and civil partnerships.
A victory for Trzaskowski would remove the president's veto, but Nawrocki would likely be an even tougher obstacle than Duda.
Nawrocki told his supporters in Gdansk that Tusk must be stopped from winning total power in Poland.
He called on supporters of two far-right candidates, Slawomir Mentzen, who came third and won 14.8%, and of Grzegorz Braun, who came fourth and won 6.3%, to ""save Poland"" from Tusk.
Karol Nawocki, a conservative historian, came in second with 29.5% of the vote, according to the exit poll 
A lot will depend on which candidate can mobilise their electorate in the second round.
Nawrocki was unknown on a national scale before Law and Justice (PiS) chose him as its candidate. But he has improved on the job, and PiS is traditionally good at getting their vote out.
Trzaskowski will need to win the votes of supporters of his centrist party, but also those supporting the candidates of the junior coalition partners, the Left (Magdalena Biejat) and conservative Third Way (Szymon Holownia).
Another worry for Trzaskowski is the better than expected result of far-right candidates because many of their supporters will not vote for him. 
Mentzen's result was a strong showing and continued the improvement of his far-right Confederation party since it entered parliament in 2019.
Who will his, mainly young voters, back in the run-off?
Many would support Nawrocki for his Catholic, family-oriented views, but they dislike PiS's left-wing economic policy of generous state benefits.
Mentzen is an anti-establishment candidate, and some of his supporters may not want to vote for either Nawrocki or Trzaskowski, who represent the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for two decades.
Far-right MEP Grzegorz Braun's result was a nasty surprise for Poland's liberal voters.
Braun made headlines in 2023 when he put out the candles on a Jewish menorah in the Polish parliament with a fire extinguisher following a ceremony for the festival of Hanukkah.
Braun called the festival ""satanic"". During a presidential debate last month he said: ""Jews have far too much say in Polish affairs."""

Leading Kenyan lawyer and the country's former Justice Minister Martha Karua says she has been deported from Tanzania to prevent her from attending the court case  of opposition leader Tundu Lissu.
Two colleagues accompanying her were also reportedly detained and deported after flying in from neighbouring Kenya. 
Former Kenyan chief justice Willy Mutunga and other prominent rights activists who later travelled there over Lissu's case said they were stopped and held at the airport. Tanzanian authorities have not yet commented. 
Lissu, who is the leader of Tanzania's main opposition Chadema party, is appearing in court on Monday after being charged with treason last month. 
Kenya's top foreign affairs official Korir Sing'oei has ""strongly urged"", external the Tanzanian authorities to release Mutunga and his delegation.
Karua is a respected human rights advocate, and a vocal critic of what she calls ""democratic backsliding"" in East Africa.
She has also been representing Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye, who was kidnapped in Kenya last year and taken back to his home country to face treason charges. 
Like Lissu, he denies the charges, arguing that they are politically motivated. 
Could this be the end of the road for Lissu, Tanzania's great survivor?
Karua served as Kenya's justice minister from 2005 to 2009, and was the running-mate of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga in his failed presidential bid in elections in 2022.  
She launched her own opposition party, the People's Liberation Party (PLP), earlier this year.
The PLP said that she - along with fellow Kenyan lawyer Gloria Kimani and human rights campaigner Lynn Ngugi - were subjected to ""hours of unwarranted interrogation"", before being deported. 
Condemning the incident, Chadema general secretary John Mnyika said: ""The solution to hiding the shame of a false treason case is not to detain foreign lawyers, but to drop the case altogether.""
The Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition said it was shocked by what it called the ""arbitrary arrests"", as Karua had been allowed into Tanzania to observe proceedings when Lissu appeared in court on 15 April. 
The former Kenyan chief justice had travelled alongside lawyer Hussein Khalid and Hanifa Adan, a prominent organiser of  the youth-led Gen Z protests last year.
Khalid posted on X a clip of the three of them at the Dar es Salam airport saying they had been ""stopped"" and their passports taken. He said their trip was ""in solidarity with Tanzanian lawyers and human rights defenders"".
Ms Adan said: ""We've been detained at Julius Nyerere international airport and we're not being told why. This is utterly ridiculous and petty. It's 3am and it's cold here... We all travelled in solidarity with Lissu who has a mention in court today.""
Another activist, Boniface Mwangi, said that armed men claiming to be police officers showed up at his hotel room in Dar es Salaam on Sunday night.
He said they left and moved to the hotel lobby after he refused to open the door and demanded that they identify themselves.
""My bags are packed, and I'm ready to go with those people when the Tanzanian lawyers who are following up on this matter arrive. For now, l will stay put.""
Human rights groups have been increasingly concerned about a crackdown on the opposition in Tanzania ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections due in October. 
Lissu cannot seek bail because he has been charged with treason, a crime for which the maximum sentence is death. 
He survived an assassination attempt in 2017 after being shot 16 times.
The opposition leader was arrested in April after he held a rally under under the slogan ""No Reforms, No Election"".
He is demanding sweeping changes, saying Tanzania's current laws do not allow for free and fair elections. The government denies the allegation. 
Since his arrest, his Chadema party has been barred from contesting the October poll after it refused to to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.
The document requires parties and their supporters to ""behave well"", and to ""maintain peace and harmony"" during the elections.
Chadema sees the code of conduct as a ploy to contain the opposition, and for state repression to continue.
The CCM party, which has governed Tanzania since 1977, is expected to retain power following the latest developments.
President Samia Suluhu Hassan is expected to be its presidential candidate. 
She was widely praised for giving Tanzanians greater political freedom when she took office in 2021 following the death of the incumbent, John Magufuli.
Her critics say Tanzania is once again seeing the repression that characterised Magufuli's rule. The government denies the allegation.

Police in India have arrested a local YouTuber on suspicions of spying for Pakistan.
Jyoti Malhotra, a travel influencer from the northern Indian state of Haryana, allegedly travelled to the neighbouring country several times - her last trip was in March 2025.
Police in Haryana allege, external that she was in touch with a Pakistan High Commission official, who was expelled from India earlier this month. 
The YouTuber's father has denied allegations that she was a spy, saying she went to Pakistan after acquiring necessary permissions.
Ms Malhotra describes herself on social media as a ""modern girl with old ideas"", and has 377,000 subscribers on YouTube and 133,000 followers on Instagram. 
But officers have questioned how she financed her travel around the globe, with her videos documenting visits to places like  Bangladesh, China, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. She has also visited several Indian destinations and religious places. Police say it defies her known source of income.
Police claim Ms Malhotra was in touch with ""Pakistani intelligence operatives"" and had continuous contact with a Pakistani citizen.
Ms Malhotra is also being investigated for any links with the Pahalgam attack, Shashank Kumar Sawan, the superintendent of police in Haryana's Hisar district, told ANI news agency. 
They say they have leads on others who may have collaborated with the influencer, who does not have direct access to any military or defence information.
""She was in touch with other YouTube influencers... She used to go to Pakistan on sponsored trips,"" Mr Sawan added. 
Her arrest comes after the Indian government asked, external Ahsan-ur-Rahim, the Pakistan High Commission official with whom the YouTuber was alleged to have been in contact, to leave the country on 13 May, alleging he had indulged in activities ""not in keeping with his official status in India"".
Pakistan also asked an Indian embassy staff member in Islamabad to leave for indulging in activities ""incompatible"" with his privileged status.
According to a complaint registered by the police, Ms Malhotra met Ahsan-ur-Rahim for the first time in 2023 when she had visited the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi, seeking a visa to visit the neighbouring country.
Her last video on Pakistan was uploaded in March, in which she was seen in the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi attending a Ramadan dinner.
In other videos from Pakistan, she is seen visiting Hindu and Sikh temples, famous local markets, and interacting with locals.
Arrests in India and Pakistan over allegations of spying are not uncommon.
Ms Malhotra's arrest comes following days of military tensions between the neighbours earlier this month. 
On 7 May, India struck what it calls ""terror infrastructure"" inside Pakistan, days after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam, a picturesque valley in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks. 
After four tense days of deadly clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, both countries agreed to a ceasefire on 10 May, announced by US President Donald Trump.

Guy Edward Bartkus, who is thought to have died in the blast, left behind writings which suggest he disapproved of people being brought into the world against their will, law enforcement sources told CBS News. 
He detonated explosives outside the clinic on Saturday morning and tried to livestream the attack, said investigators.
Four other people were injured in the explosion and have been released from hospital. None of the wounded are staff or patients at the clinic.
""The subject had nihilistic ideations and this was a targeted attack,"" said Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.
The FBI is reviewing a manifesto they believe is linked to Bartkus, who lived at  Twentynine Palms, home to a large marine base.
He loaded his 2010 silver Ford Fusion sedan with explosives before driving an hour from Twentynine Palms to Palm Springs, investigators said.
His father told CBS News Los Angeles that he had not spoken to his son in more than 10 years and that he had ""just changed"" after moving to Twentynine Palms.
Mr Davis said the FBI is still looking for the public's help to piece together the suspect's whereabouts before the blast, and will remain on scene for the next day or two to continue their investigation. 
The FBI identified the suspect in the Palm Springs blast as 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus
The blast was felt more than a mile away. Mr Davis referred to it as ""the largest bombing scene"" the FBI had seen in southern California in recent memory, and said police are working to survey evidence that is scattered 100 feet away from the explosion ""in every direction"".
Several buildings were damaged in the blast, including the ACR fertility clinic with images showing a portion of its wall destroyed.
The fertility clinic said their lab, including all eggs and embryos, remained ""fully secure and undamaged"".
But Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told the Associated Press that the clinic's office was damaged.
""I really have no clue what happened,"" he said. ""Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.""
According to its website, the ARC clinic is the first full-service fertility centre and IVF lab in the Coachella Valley.
It offers services including fertility evaluations, IVF, egg donation and freezing, reproductive support for same-sex couples and surrogacy."

The liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, has fought off a strong  challenge from a Romanian right-wing nationalist to win the presidency after months of political turbulence.
George Simion, the leader of the far-right AUR party, won a dramatic first-round victory earlier this month, riding a wave of anger from Romanians who had seen the presidential race annulled late last year because of claims of Russian interference.
But it was the softly spoken Nicusor Dan who swept to victory with 53.6% of the vote, even though Simion was more successful in the diaspora.
""We need to build Romania together irrespective of who you voted for,"" said Dan, once his victory was secure.
About 11.5 million Romanians voted in Sunday's run-off, and Dan attracted the support of more than six million of them.
The mathematician waited until after midnight on Sunday before he could be absolutely sure that the numbers were on his side and he could join his supporters in a park opposite City Hall in Bucharest.
They went wild, chanting his name and cheering. At one point he was almost mobbed but this was a huge moment for the president-elect and for his supporters after months of political tension.
""A community of Romanians who want a profound change in Romania won,"" Dan said.
Mihai, one of many Dan supporters who gathered outside his electoral headquarters in the capital, told the BBC he was ""really worried about Simion"". 
""I want to choose the pro-European way. It's the only way. It's really important,"" he added.
Andrea, who came with her young daughter, told the BBC: ""We are so happy, we wanted to be here with other supporters of Nicosur.
""This means a better future for our children, for us. A good life for all of us, and an honest Romania.""
Romanians are broadly unhappy with the dominance of mainstream parties and the turbulence in this European Union and Nato member state intensified earlier this month when the government collapsed because its candidate had failed to make the second round.
While Nicusor Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and maintaining support for north-eastern neighbour Ukraine, Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv.
""Russia, don't forget, Romania isn't yours,"" Dan's supporters chanted.
Even though exit polls had given him victory, they did not include the all-important diaspora vote and Simion clung to the belief that he could still win.
""I won, I am the new president of Romania and I am giving back power to the Romanians,"" he insisted initially.
It was not until the early hours of Monday that he conceded victory on Facebook. A protest planned by his supporters was then apparently called off. 
During the election campaign Simion had stood side by side with Calin Georgescu, the far-right fringe figure who had stunned Romania with a first-round presidential victory at the end of last year, buoyed by an enormous TikTok campaign.
The vote was annulled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference and Georgescu was barred from running again. Russia denied any involvement.
Asked by the BBC on Sunday whether he was acting as Georgescu's puppet, George Simion said: ""The puppets are those who annulled the elections... I am a man of my people and my people voted for Calin Georgescu.
""Do we like democracy only when the good guy has won? I don't think this is an option.""
He said he was a patriot and accused what he called the mainstream media of smearing him as a pro-Russian or fascist.
George Simion says he is ""a man of my people and represent change""
The key to Simion's success in the first round was his extraordinary win among diaspora voters in Western Europe, including in the UK.
His supporters turned out in force again on Sunday, with partial results giving him 68.5% support in Spain, 66.8% in Italy and 67% in Germany. He also had the edge in the UK, where voters said they would have picked Calin Georgescu if authorities had not barred him from running.
""We didn't know anything about [Georgescu] but then I listened to what he was saying, and you can tell he's a good Christian,"" said 37-year-old Catalina Grancea. 
She had vowed to go back to Romania if Simion had won and her mother Maria said she too had voted for change: ""Our children were forced to leave Romania because they couldn't find any jobs there.""
Catalina Grancea and her mother Maria had been impressed by Calin Georgescu
However, Nicusor Dan's voters came out in even bigger numbers both in Romania and abroad. In neighbouring Moldova 87% of Romanians backed the mayor of Bucharest.
The presidents of both Moldova and Ukraine congratulated him on his victory.
""Moldova and Romania stand together, supporting one another and working side by side for a peaceful, democratic, and European future for all our citizens,"" said Maia Sandu.
""For Ukraine, as a neighbour and friend, it is important to have Romania as a reliable partner,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on social media that Romanians had turned out in massive numbers and had ""chosen the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe"".
In the end this was an emphatic ""No"" vote to a staunch nationalist with an isolationist vision for Romania, a known provocateur and a man whose commitment to EU membership and to the bloc's core values was not clear.
Despite his strong showing in round one, those Romanians who worried about what he stood for appear to have rallied to block him from power.
But Simion did win a significant chunk of the vote, and his message will still resonate with many."

This story contains details, including a video, that some people may find distressing.
The most shocking thing for Jonathan, who had endured six gruelling months living and working underground in an abandoned South African gold mine, was the abuse he witnessed being meted out to children.
Some are recruited for cheap labour, but others are brought in specifically for sex, campaigners say.
Jonathan, now in his late 20s, had migrated to South Africa from a nearby country on the promise of making easy money working in one of its dozens of disused mines, closed by multinationals because they were no longer commercially viable.
We are protecting his full identity as he fears reprisals from the vicious criminal gangs that run the illegal mining industry for speaking to the media.
Details of what the young people were going though emerged after the death of dozens of illegal miners near the town of Stilfontein late last year when the mine was blockaded by police.
In a calm and steady voice, Jonathan describes the heat, long hours and limited food and sleeping options which took a toll on his body.
But an enduring memory is what happened to the underage miners in the shaft where he worked.
""I used to see these kids in the mine - teenagers actually, 15, 17-year-olds.
""Others used to take advantage of them sometimes. It was a little bit scary, and I wasn't comfortable with it.""
He said they were raped by adult miners who promised to give them some of the gold they found in exchange for sex.
""If that kid is desperate for money, he will take the risk.""
Jonathan describes how the children would approach teams of miners for protection but ""that team would have conditions"".
Sex was also used as punishment if the teenagers failed to complete a task for their team.
Jonathan says the children in the mine where he worked were all foreign and did not realise what they were getting themselves into.
Illegal miners enter abandoned mines through disused shafts, often descending kilometres and not able to leave for months
Mining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up.
He says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa.
Many of them are abducted from neighbouring countries and trafficked. They are enticed by baseless promises of finding them employment in the formal mining industry.
""Their passports are confiscated when they get to South Africaâ¦ It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused,"" Mr Sefuli says.
The BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.
Tshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.
""In some instances, they did it for the money. Some are recruited solely for that purpose, because of the financial incentives that will come with the practice of maybe trading sex underground.""
He adds that the abuse deeply affected the children.
""They change their behaviour patterns and have trust issues. They don't want you to get close to them, because they feel that they can no longer trust anyone.""
South Africa's illegal mining industry made global headlines last year following a standoff between police and miners at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, near the town of Stilfontein in the North West Province.
Trapped underground with decaying bodies, miners faced a dark reality
Inside South Africa's 'ruthless' gang-controlled gold mines
The authorities had been trying to curb illegal mining, which the government said cost South Africa's economy $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn) in lost revenue last year.
They launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs.
As part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, ""smoke out"" the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested.
Soon footage began to emerge from within the mine showing dozens of emaciated men begging to be rescued, as well as rows of body bags. Eventually a court ordered the authorities to save the men.
Videos shot underground at Stilfontein earlier this year showed scenes of dead bodies and emaciated figures
Among those brought up were many who said they were underage, but as a number of them were migrants without documents confirming how old they were, the authorities carried out medical tests to get an estimate.
Through this, the Department of Social Development (DSD) confirmed that 31 of the rescued Stilfontein miners were found to be children. They were all Mozambicans nationals and in November, 27 of them were repatriated.
Save the Children South Africa helped translate some of the interviews between the underage miners and the rescue workers.
""They went through trauma, because some of them also saw others being sexually exploited,"" the charity's CEO Gugu Xaba tells the BBC.
""Just the feeling that they may not come out of there destroyed those children mentally. 
""The adult miners would start by grooming them, by acting like they like them.""
She says the children were then made to perform sexual acts on the adults and they were then raped, days after day.
""You find that the adult will have three or four of them that they are doing the same thing to.""

Ms Xaba says mining gangs recruit children because they are easier to manipulate and cheaper.
""Children don't understand when you say: 'I'll pay you 20 rands ($1; Â£0.80) per day.' The adults sometimes refuse to work, but children find themselves with no choice. So it's easier to use a child to do the work. It's easier to take a child who's kind of voiceless and to bring them down there.""
Beyond being exploited financially, she says there are gangs that recruit children specifically for sex.
Many illegal miners spend months underground, rarely going up to the surface. Markets spring up underground to provide them with anything they need.
""Most children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And you've got a pimp who is taking the money, and it means every day this child is used as a commercial sex worker.""
The BBC asked the police and the DSD whether anyone would be charged over the sexual abuse allegations. They did not respond to our requests.
A source working on the Stilfontein miners' cases said many of the children did not want to testify.
Meanwhile, the illegal mining industry continues to thrive.
And with an estimated 6,000 vacant mines potentially available to explore, it is a business that is unlikely to end anytime soon, leaving thousands of vulnerable children at risk.

It was early 2022, another dark day in London. Lovina Shenoy was new to the city, navigating her way through an unfamiliar and sometimes overwhelming environment.
""Back in India, you have your family, you have your school friends, you have your college friends, you have your entire support system, and you're in your comfort zone,"" the 39-year-old tells the BBC. 
""But when you come to a new country, you're suddenly just left off. You're just all by yourself.""
She had spent a decade in Dubai, surrounded by a largely expat-Indian community, and before that, lived in her birth city of Mumbai. 
Moving to London for her husband's new job was an exciting opportunity, but despite being in a city of more than 8.9 million people, it still felt isolating.
Lovina was craving female friendships. She was happy to have the company of her husband and two children, but there was something missing.
""Within a week of moving to London, I realised that the sun starts setting at around 14:00,"" Lovina jokes. ""I thought, I'm going to end up being really lonely and depressed. I have no friends.""
So she posted an open message on her Facebook account: ""Hey, I'm Lovina, I'm from Mumbai. I was in Dubai for a decade before I moved here. Is anyone free for a cup of coffee?""
To her surprise, dozens of women replied saying they would love to meet her.
She quickly suggested a location in Wembley and was surprised to find more than 30 women turning up.
""I was shocked. I'm in a new country and 30 women I didn't know made the effort to join me for a cup of coffee,"" she says. ""I thought, wow, I've got my tribe.""
Lovina's Facebook group now has more than 38,000 members
Lovina is part of the largest immigrant group to the UK. 
According to the 2021-22 UK Census, an estimated 32% of all foreign-born residents in the UK came from five countries: Poland, Pakistan, Romania, Ireland and India. 
Indians made up the highest number of immigrants to the UK with 965,000 people, representing 9% of foreign-born residents.
Following that initial coffee get-together, Lovina started the Indian Women in London & UK (IWLUK) group on Facebook in March 2022. 
Shortly after, she started a number of WhatsApp groups according to specific-locations. In just over three years, there are more than 38,000 members on Facebook and 15,000 women across WhatsApp.
Lovina and the group's other three admins, Prableen Rupraâ , Disha Rawat and Nishi Gill, say that they recognised several challenges faced by migrant women in a new country so worked to tackle it. 
They say they established IWLUK to bridge the gap between expats and UK-born Indian women, with the aim of fostering connections through various social and business networking events.
The community organises several meetups a month, including walking clubs, brunch, Bollywood-themed parties, mothers meetups and career networking events. 
They say that the initiatives have not only deepened their friendships but also facilitated professional development, allowing entrepreneurs to connect. 
A member of the group, Anu Chandrasekar, says the community gave her the confidence to start her private career coaching business in 2025, after more than 20 years working in the corporate environment.
""The women definitely gave me the confidence to branch out,"" she says.
Anu Chandrasekar said she launched her business with the encouragement of the community 
Beyond professional and social development, the community has also offered meaningful support for women facing serious personal challenges. 
In one instance, a woman posted anonymously in the Facebook group, revealing that her husband had thrown her out of their home. 
Nishi saw the message and quickly made contact with the woman. She arranged support from Indian domestic violence specialists, and organised a safe place for the woman to stay.
""The group was her first port of call,"" says Nishi. ""As an immigrant woman she didn't have the knowledge to approach national charities. But she knew about our group.""
Nishi Gill said the group helps signpost women in vulnerable positions to the right support
Another woman directly benefitting from the knowledge of the community group is Priya Mahajan, from the IWLUK's Mum's Club, who moved to the UK in 2022 with her six-month-old daughter. She found herself unexpectedly overwhelmed when in a UK supermarket.
""I saw so many different types of milk. There was a green one. There was a blue one,"" Priya says.
""Where I'm from in India we have cow's milk and buffalo milk. There is no differentiation of skimmed, semi-skimmed, high fat, low fat. I was so confused."" 
So she asked the group and they offered advice.
Priya could have typed her questions into a search engine but she says she felt more comfortable asking other Indian women in a group.
""The group has filled in the roles of people in my life,"" says Priya. ""I found a mother in somebody, a grandmother in somebody, a friend in someone.""
Priya Mahajan has turned to the group to ask questions, saying she felt ""more comfortable"" asking other Indian women
There has been some criticism though, including why the group does not include men. 
Lovina took this on board and started a secondary Facebook group called the Indian Professionals in London and UK, which is gender-inclusive. That group has more than 53,000 members.
""I created a group specifically for Indian women, not all women, because I have the specific knowledge about the cultural festivals in the Indian community, like Diwali,"" says Lovina.
""I am relatable for Indian women. I would know how to run a community for women of similar cultural background to me.""
Lovina said the group provides a ""home away from home"" for Indian women 
Lovina's group could be part of a solution to tackle the serious impact loneliness has on physical and mental health, an issue that seems to be affecting people around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic halted economic and social activity. 
It has been reported that one in five people around the world may experience social isolation, external.
The World Health Organization has set up a special commission on social connection, external to gather findings for 2026, and the US Surgeon General has publicly called for loneliness to be treated as a public health priority, external.
The members of IWLUK say that their community is an example of grassroots support, helping women reconnect when many feel distant from familiar environments.
""We are like the home away from home for the Indian women in the UK,"" says Lovina. ""I think that's the biggest support system for us.""

316,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2e7vrqyyyo,2025-05-19 04:47:28,"What we know about Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis,","Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.
Biden received the news on Friday after he saw a doctor last week for urinary symptoms.
Here's what you need to know about prostate cancer and its treatment options.
Prostate cancer affects tissue of the prostate gland, the part of the male reproductive system that helps make semen. It is located between the penis and the bladder.
According to the NHS, it usually develops slowly, meaning some live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment.
In Biden's case, the cancer is aggressive, and his family are said to be reviewing options for treatment.
Biden was diagnosed following urinary symptoms, one of the most common signs of prostate cancer. That's because it is often detected only when the prostate is big enough to have impacted the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the penis.
Joe Biden diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer
Analysis: Another formidable challenge for Biden
Those symptoms can include needing to urinate more frequently, as well as a slow or weak urinary stream.
Screening for prostate cancer is part of routine presidential health inspections, according to Dr Jeffrey Kuhlman, former White House doctor under President Barack Obama.
Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in American men, according to the American Cancer Society, behind lung cancer.
There will be more than 300,000 new cases in the US this year, according to projections by the American Cancer Society. About one in 8 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.
While it is ""not uncommon"" for men in their 80s to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the grade and stage of Biden's cancer are ""more advanced than most men would encounter"" at diagnosis, Dr Ryan Cleary, urologist at MedStar Health, told the BBC.
The former president's prostate cancer is ""characterised by a Gleason score of 9"", his office said in the statement announcing his diagnosis.
In the US, the Gleason score is a common way of grading the capacity for cells from the primary tumour to spread round the body - also known as metastatic cancer.
Specifically, it refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look in a sample under a microscope. The scale runs from six to 10, with a higher number indicating a more aggressive cancer.
The scale starts at six because it is calculated by combining the two most common patterns of cancer cells found in a patient. The lowest score assigned to cancerous cells is three. That's why the lowest Gleason score for a cancer diagnosis is six.
A Gleason score of nine, such as Biden's, means it is a ""high-grade cancer"". Cancer cells with a score of nine look very abnormal and are likely to grow quickly.
Biden's cancer is aggressive in nature and has already spread to his bones.
According to Dr Jamin Vinod Brahmbhatt, a urologist at Orlando Health Medical Group, this level of spread does limit the treatment options.
While there are medical based treatments such as chemotherapy, steroids and hormone therapy available, none of them are ""curative"", he said.
""There are more medical options to stabilise the patient and control the cancer, but it never gets rid of the cancer completely.""
Biden's cancer is also said to be hormone sensitive, which means the cancer uses hormones to grow or develop.
These types of cancers can be managed by drugs that block or lower the amount of hormones in the body.
Dr Brahmbhatt said while this ""opens up the toolkit"" of treatment options for Biden, it was going to take ""weeks or months"" to see how he responds.
Dr Kuhlman said Biden could also have the option of entering ""clinical trials for advanced disease"" if he meets the inclusion criteria.
Biden and his family are said to be reviewing treatment options.
In Sunday's statement, Biden's office said since the cancer appeared to be hormone-sensitive, that ""allows for effective management"".
The full details of Biden's case are not known. Dr Cleary said: ""Generally, about a third of patients will still be alive after five years of metastatic prostate cancer.""
However, advanced stages of prostate cancer can limit a person's lifespan and lead to symptoms that make daily life harder.
Dr Kuhlman said it was important to consider treatments that maintain Biden's quality of life in the next few years.
""If there's any inspiration in this, it is to go and get yourself checked out whether you have symptoms or not,"" Dr Brahmbhatt said."
317,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62vg853n6qo,2025-05-19 03:01:58,"Biden's cancer diagnosis is another formidable challenge,","Joe Biden's half-century in politics has been an exercise in overcoming adversity. 
From the death of his wife and young daughter in a car accident in 1972, to two early and unsuccessful presidential bids, to the death of his eldest son at just 46, his decades in Washington have been defined by tragedy but often followed by triumph.
Now, just four months after leaving office as a one-term president, and as intense scrutiny is placed on his mental and physical decline during those four years, the 82-year-old has been diagnosed with aggressive and advanced prostate cancer.
It is a disease that has never been far from his mind in the 10 years since his oldest son, Beau, died of brain cancer â leaving a deep emotional scar on the father that lingers to this day.
After that tragedy, finding a cure for cancer became a cause for the elder Biden. 
In 2016, then-President Barack Obama tasked him with leading a ""moonshot"" government-wide research effort to that end - an effort that Biden continued during his own presidency.
Now it is cancer that presents possibly the greatest threat to Biden's health since he nearly died of a brain aneurism shortly after he abandoned his first presidential bid in 1988.
The news of the diagnosis lands as Democrats continue to grapple with the consequences of Biden's fateful decision to seek a second presidential term in the 2024 election â an attempt to extend the record he had already set for the oldest occupant of the Oval Office.
Biden ultimately dropped out of the race after intense pressure from Democrats following his halting, at times incomprehensible, performance in a general election debate with Donald Trump last June. But until that point, he had insisted that he was fit to continue in the White House for another four years. 
This cancer diagnosis will underscore that the concerns about his age and the potential for health issues expressed by a majority of American voters in national polling were valid.
It coincides with the publication of several books detailing the efforts by those close to the president in the White House to accommodate, and conceal from the public, the toll the years were taking on his body and mind while he continued to serve as commander-in-chief. 
While there is no reason to believe that Biden's prostate issues were at all apparent while he was in the White House, the fact that such an aggressive form of cancer could avoid detection until it had already spread, despite the wealth of medical support and evaluation available to Biden, will raise new questions and concerns.
It sets up a troubling hypothetical of how Biden's cancer might have been treated if he had successfully won a second term.
Hypotheticals notwithstanding, Biden's diagnosis may temper some of the sharper criticisms the book revelations would have otherwise prompted. 
President Donald Trump, who had spent much of his recent trip to the Middle East disparaging his predecessor, released a statement extending his ""warmest and best wishes"" to the Biden family. That may be representative of the tenor of the public dialogue around Biden in the coming days.
Until several recent media interviews, including one with the BBC in which he defended his decision to stay in the 2024 race until a late stage, Biden had largely receded from public view since leaving power in January. 
If the former president has the energy and endurance to do so, this latest medical revelation might give him a new platform, and a newly sympathetic public, to attempt to defend and burnish his presidential legacy.
Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has defined himself by his persistence and endurance, only reaching the pinnacle of American power late in life.
His illness is another formidable challenge. But it presents one more opportunity for Biden to define himself â as a politician and as a man - by how he handles it."

British mountaineer Kenton Cool has scaled Mount Everest for the 19th time, breaking his own record for the most climbs up the world's tallest mountain for a non-sherpa.
The 51-year-old, who was accompanied by Nepali sherpa Dorji Gyaljen, reached the 8,849m (29,000ft) high summit at 11:00 local time (04:15 GMT) on Sunday. 
Mr Cool first climbed Everest in 2004 and has summited it almost yearly since. 
Mr Gyaljen logged his 23rd climb up Everest. Another Nepali sherpa, Kami Rita, holds the record for making the most number of Everest summits at 30, and is also currently on the mountain attempting to set a new record.
Mr Cool's record-setting feat comes after at least two climbers - Subrata Ghosh from India and Philipp ""PJ"" Santiago II from the Philippines - died on Mount Everest this week.
After his 16th Everest ascent in 2022, Mr Cool appeared to play down his record, noting that many Nepali climbers have surpassed it.
""I'm really surprised by the interest... considering that so many of the sherpas have so many more ascents,"" he told AFP in an interview then. 
Four days before the latest feat, Mr Cool told his Instagram followers that he ""finally [had] a positive forecast"" that will allow him to go ahead with the attempt.
""Let's hope that we manage to thread the needle with regard to numbers of climbers and we have a safe and enjoyable time up high,"" he wrote.
Fellow climbers hailed the achievement.
Mr Cool is a ""great person to share stories from two decades on the mountain"", American adventurer Adrian Ballinger told Reuters news agency.
""His experience, charisma, and strength make him a valuable part of the Everest community,"" says Mr Ballinger, who is currently guiding a team up Everest.
""Amazing, Kenton,"" wrote Jordanian mountaineer Mostafa Salameh, who is one of only 20 people to climb the highest mountains on all seven continents and conquer the North and South Poles. 
Mr Cool is also a mountain guide who has led British explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, among others, on several notable climbs including Everest."

Portugal's governing right-of-centre Democratic Alliance has won snap parliamentary elections - the third in as many years - again falling short of a majority. 
Its leader LuÃ­s Montenegro promised supporters to ""stimulate investment"" and to ""guarantee prosperity and social justice"".
Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation after his party finished in second, and lost so many seats it ended up neck-and-neck with far-right Chega - a relatively newcomer. 
The Socialists could even slip behind Chega if results from voters abroad, which take a few days to come in, mirror those in last year's election, when two out of the four seats went to Chega, and one to the Socialists.
Chega leader AndrÃ© Ventura said the ""historic"" result marked the end of two-party dominance in Portugal. 
His campaign had focussed on the issues of immigration and corruption, and Chega was probably helped by the fact that this election and the previous one were both triggered by scandals involving the prime minister of the day.
Montenegro, in his remarks to supporters, thanked both his family and the ""political family"" that defended him from attacks relating to deals done by a company he set up before he became party leader, and which is now owned by his sons. 
This was the controversy that triggered the election, after the government lost a vote of confidence.
Meanwhile, Santos, in his own parting comments, reiterated his view that Montenegro was not fit to be prime minister, suggesting that the Socialist Party should not let the matter drop."

Just as India showed flickers of progress toward its long-held dream of becoming the world's factory, Washington and Beijing announced a trade ""reset"" that could derail Delhi's ambitions to replace China as the global manufacturing hub.
Last week, Trump's tariffs on China dropped overnight - from 145% to 30%, vs 27% for India - as the two sides thrashed out an agreement in Switzerland.
As a result, there's a chance manufacturing investment that was moving from China to India could either ""stall"" or ""head back"", feels Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based think tank, Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI). 
""India's low-cost assembly lines may survive, but value-added growth is in danger.""
The change in sentiment stands in sharp relief to the exuberance in Delhi last month when Apple indicated that it was shifting most of its production of iPhones headed to the US from China to India.
That may well still happen, even though US President Donald Trump revealed that he had told Apple CEO Tim Cook not to build in India because it was ""one of the highest tariff nations in the world"".
""India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,"" Shilan Shah, an economist with Capital Economics, wrote in an investor note before the deal was announced. He pointed out that 40% of India's exports to the US were ""similar to those exported by China"".
There were early signs that Indian exporters were already stepping in to fill the gap left by Chinese producers. New export orders surged to a 14-year high, according to a recent survey of Indian manufacturers.
Nomura, a Japanese broking house, also pointed to growing ""anecdotal evidence"" of India emerging as a winner from ""trade diversion and supply-chain shift in low and mid-tech manufacturing"" particularly in sectors like electronics, textiles and toys.
The US and China agreed to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries
Some analysts do believe that despite the so-called trade ""reset"" between Beijing and Washington, a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run.
For one, there's greater willingness by Narendra Modi's government to open its doors to foreign companies after years of protectionist policies, which could provide tailwind.
India and the US are also negotiating a trade deal that could put Asia's third-largest economy in a sweet spot to benefit from the so-called ""China exodus"" - as global firms shift operations to diversify supply chains.
India has just signed a trade pact with the UK, sharply cutting duties in protected sectors like whiskey and automobiles. It offers a glimpse of the concessions Delhi might offer Trump in the ongoing India-US trade talks.
But all of this optimism needs to be tempered for more reasons than one.
Apart from the fact that China is now back in the running, companies are also ""not entirely writing off other Asian competitors, with countries like Vietnam still on their radars"", economists Sonal Verma and Aurodeep Nandi from Nomura said in a note earlier this month. 
""Hence, for India to capitalise on this opportunity, it needs to complement any tariff arbitrage with serious ease-of-doing-business reforms.""
A tough business climate has long frustrated foreign investors and stalled India's manufacturing growth, with its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stuck at around 15% for two decades.
The Modi government's efforts, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI), external scheme, have delivered only limited success in boosting this figure.
The government's think tank, Niti Aayog, has acknowledged India's ""limited success"" in attracting investment shifting from China. It noted that factors like cheaper labour, simpler tax laws, lower tariffs, and proactive Free Trade Agreements helped countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and Malaysia expand exports - while India lagged behind. 
India's attempts to expand manufacturing has seen limited success.
Another major concern, says Nomura, is India's ongoing reliance on China for raw materials and components used in electronics like iPhones, limiting Delhi's ability to fully capitalise on supply chain shifts.
""India's earnings from making iPhones will only rise if more of the phone is made locally,"" Mr Srivastava told the BBC.
According to him, right now Apple earns over $450 per iPhone sold in the US while India keeps less than $25 - even though the full $1,000 is counted as an Indian export.
""Just assembling more iPhones in India won't help much unless Apple and its suppliers also start making components and doing high-value work here. Without that, India's share stays small, and the export numbers go up only on paper -possibly triggering more scrutiny from the US without real economic gain for India,"" Mr Srivastava said.
The jobs created by such assembly lines aren't very high quality either, says GTRI.
Quite unlike companies like Nokia which set up a factory in the southern city of Chennai in 2007 where suppliers moved in together, ""today's smartphone makers mostly import parts and push for lower tariffs instead of building supply chains in India"", explained Mr Srivastava. He noted that, in certain instances, the investment made could be lower than the subsidies received under India's PLI scheme. 
Finally there are concerns that Chinese exporters could try to use India to reroute products to the US.
India doesn't seem averse to this idea despite the pitfalls. The country's top economic adviser said last year that the country should attract more Chinese businesses to set-up export oriented factories and boost its manufacturing industry â a tacit admission that its own industrial policy hadn't delivered.
But experts caution, this could further curtail India's ability to build local know-how and grow its own industrial base.
All of this shows that beyond the headline-grabbing announcements by the likes of Apple, India is still a long way from realising its factory ambitions.
""Slash production costs, fix logistics, and build regulatory certainty,"" Mr Srivastava urged policymakers in a social media post. 
""Let's be clear. This US-China reset is damage control, not a long-term solution. India must play the long game, or risk getting side-lined.""

Among the cactuses in the desert of Arizona, just outside Phoenix, an extraordinary collection of buildings is emerging that will shape the future of the global economy and the world.
The hum of further construction is creating not just a factory for the world's most advanced semiconductors. Eventually, it will mass produce the most advanced chips in the world. This work is being done in the US for the first time, with the Taiwanese company behind it pledging to spend billions more here in a move aimed at heading off the threat of tariffs on imported chips.
It is, in my view, the most important factory in the world, and it's being built by a company you may not have heard of: TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It makes 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors. Until now they were all made on the island of Taiwan, which is 100 miles east of the Chinese mainland. The Apple chip in your iPhone, the Nvidia chips powering your ChatGPT queries, the chips in your laptop or computer network, all are made by TSMC.
Its Arizona facility ""Fab 21"" is closely guarded. Blank paper or personal devices are not allowed in case designs are leaked. It houses some of the most important intellectual property in the world, and the process to make these chips is one of the most complicated and intensive in global manufacturing. 
TSMC's Arizona factory is closely guarded
They're hugely protective of the secrets that lie within. Important customers, such as Apple and Nvidia, trust this company to safeguard their designs for future products. 
But after months of asking, TSMC let the BBC in to look at the partial transfer of what some argue is the most critical, expensive, complex and important manufacturing in the world.
President Trump certainly seems to think so. He often mentions the factory in passing. ""TSMC is the biggest there is,"" he has said. ""We gradually lost the chip business, and now it's almost exclusively in Taiwan. They stole it from us."" This is one of the US president's regular refrains.
TSMC's recent decision to expand its investments in the US by a further $100bn (Â£75bn) is something Trump attributes to his threats of tariffs on Taiwan and on the global semiconductor business.
The expansion of the Arizona facility, which was announced in March is, he believes, the poster child for his economic policies - in particular the encouragement of foreign companies to relocate factories to the US to avoid hefty tariffs.
Trump heralded TSMC's decision to invest in the US as proof of success for his tariff policy
China is also watching developments carefully. Taiwan's chip-making prowess has been part of what its government has called its ""Silicon Shield"", against a much-feared invasion. While the original strategy was to make Taiwan indispensable in this area of critical technology, the pandemic supply chain difficulties changed the calculus because relying on a single country seemed like a greater risk.
China claims the self-ruled Taiwan as its territory but Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland.
So, many currents of the world economy, frontier technology and geopolitics flow through this one site and within it lies the essential contradiction of Trump's economic and diplomatic policy. 
He sees this plant as the exemplar of America First, and the preservation of economic and military superiority over China. Yet the manufacture of these modern miniaturised miracles at the frontier of physics and chemistry inherently relies on a combination of the very best technologies from around the world.
Greg Jackson, one of the facilities managers, takes me around in a golf buggy. The factories are almost a carbon copy of the TSMC spaces in Taiwan, where he trained. ""I would say these facilities are probably some of the most advanced and complicated in the world,"" he says.
""It's quite the dichotomy. You've got really, really small chips with really small structures, and it takes this massive facility with all the infrastructure to be able to make them... Just the sheer complexity, the amount of systems that it takes, is staggering.""
Inside the ""Gowning Building"", workers dress in protective clothing before crossing a bridge that is supposed to create the cleanest environment on Earth, in order to protect the production of these extraordinary microscopic transistors that create the microchips underpinning everything.
Konstantinos Ninios, an engineer, shows me some of the very first productions from TSMC Arizona: a silicon wafer with what is known as ""4 nanometre chips"". 
""This is the most advanced wafer in the US right now,"" he explains. ""[It] contains about 10 to 14 trillion transistors... The whole process is 3,000 to 4,000 steps.""
If you could somehow shrink your body to the same scale and get inside the wafer, he says that the many different layers would look like very tall streets and skyscrapers.
TSMC was founded at the behest of the Taiwanese government in 1987, when chip executive Morris Chang was directed to start the business. The model was to become a dedicated foundry for microchips, manufacturing other companies' designs. It became wildly successful.
Driving the advancement of the technology is the miniaturisation of the smallest feature on chips. Their size is measured these days in billionths of a metre or nanometres. This progress has enabled mobile phones to become smartphones, and is now setting the pace for the mass deployment of artificial intelligence. 
It requires incredible complexity and expense through the use of ""extreme ultraviolet (UV) light"". This is used to etch the intricate building blocks of our modern existence in a process called ""lithography"". 
The world's dependence on TSMC is built on highly specialised bus-sized machines, which are in turn sourced almost entirely from a Dutch company called ASML, including in Arizona.
These machines shoot UV light tens of thousands of times through drops of molten tin, which creates a plasma, and is then refracted through a series of specialised mirrors. 
The almost entirely automated process for each wafer of silicon is repeated thousands of times in layers over months, before the $1m LP-sized wafer of 4nm silicon chips is formed.
""Just imagine a particle or a dust particle falling into this,"" Mr Ninios says to me incredulously. ""The transistors are not going to work. So all of this is cleaner than hospital operating rooms.""
Taiwan does not have special access to the raw materials - but it has the know-how to stay years ahead of other companies in the intricate process of producing these atomic building blocks of modern life.
Some in the Taiwanese government are cautious about spreading the frontier of this technology off the island. Trump wasted little time in claiming the firm's decision to bring its highest level of technology to the US was due to his economic policies.
He said this would not have happened without the stick of his planned tariffs on Taiwan and semiconductors. Those I speak to at TSMC are diplomatic about that claim.
Much of this was already planned and subsidised under former US President Biden's Chips Act. 
The supply chain for semiconductors is global as no single country can do everything at the moment, says Rose Castanares, President of TSMC Arizona
On the walkway into the building are photographs showing Biden's visit in 2022, with the building site draped in the Stars and Stripes and a banner saying ""a future Made in America"".
""The semiconductor supply chain is global,"" says TSMC Arizona President Rose Castanares. ""There's really no single country at this moment that can do everything from chemicals to wafer manufacturing to packaging, and so it's very difficult to unwind that whole thing very quickly.""
As for the semiconductor supply chain, tariffs will not help. The supply chain stretches all over the world. Whether it's the silicon wafers from Japan, the machines required from the Netherlands, or mirrors from Germany, all sorts of materials from all around the world are required. Now, they could face import charges.
That said, TSMC's boss was quick off the mark in confirming the expansion of the US site at an event with Trump at the White House. In recent weeks, America's tech elite - from Apple's Tim Cook, to Nvidia's Jensen Huang - have been queueing up to tell the world that TSMC Arizona will now produce many of the chips in their US products.
The global chip industry is very sensitive to the economic cycle, but its cutting-edge technology enjoys very healthy margins, that could cushion some of these planned tariffs.
The company was founded in Taiwan in 1987. In March this year, they announced an expansion of their Arizona facility
There are many geopolitical subtexts here. The factory sits at the heart of US strategy to gain technological, AI and economic supremacy over China.
Both the Biden and Trump administrations have developed policies to try to limit Chinese access to the frontier semiconductor technology - from a ban on exports to China of ASML's machines, to new legislation to ban the use of Huawei AI chips in US software or technology anywhere in the world.
Taiwan's President Lai this week urged democracies such as Japan and the US to develop ""non-Red"" supply chains to counter China.
Not everyone is convinced that this strategy is working, however. Chinese technologists have been effective at working around the bans to develop competitive indigenous technology. And Bill Gates this week said that these policies ""have forced the Chinese in terms of chip manufacturing and everything to go full speed ahead"".
Trump wants TSMC Arizona to become a foundation stone for his American golden age. But the company's story to date is perhaps the ultimate expression of the success of modern globalisation.
So for now, it's a battle for global tech and economic supremacy, in which Taiwan's factory technology, some of which is now being moved to the Arizona desert, is the critical asset.

The Mass from the first US and Peruvian pontiff also drew attendance from dignitaries including US Vice President JD Vance as well as politicians from Germany to Peru as well as faith leaders and European royals.  
""We still see too much discord, too many wounds caused by hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth's resources and marginalises the poorest,"" he said.
In a prayer afterwards, he noted the efforts for a ceasefire in Ukraine, before holding a private audience with Zelensky and his wife.
""The martyred Ukraine is waiting for negotiations for a just and lasting peace to finally happen,"" Pope Leo said.
Last week, he had offered the Vatican as a venue for possible peace talks after Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down Zelensky's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey for negotiations.
Prior to giving his Mass, there had been cheers from the crowd when the pontiff appeared in his popemobile as it drove around St Peter's Square and down Via della Conciliazione to the river Tiber and back. 
There was a strong sense of excitement in the square. Michelle, from Germany, told the BBC she ""came on purpose to see the Pope"".

Joe from the US state of Missouri said: ""We're on vacation, but it's great timing. We're here to see the Pope's inaugural Mass. It's very special. I'm glad we came early.""
He said he was ""extra proud"" to see the first Pope from the United States. ""That was a surprise. He's gonna be a wonderful Pope. I am not Catholic, but I grew up Catholic, but this is just inspiring no matter what denomination of Christian you are.""
Also in the crowds was Pia, from Chile, a professor of philosophy at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome. She told the BBC she felt there was ""a new hope in the church"".
Pia said that among the Pope's first words when he was elected was ""Let the peace be with you"", the words of Jesus. And then he said ""don't be afraid"". 
""He knows what the world and the church needs. A church that is preaching hope, preaching peace. I think many people are waiting for that,"" she said.
The Pope's official inauguration followed the Mass, with a pallium garment - a white woolen band - placed on the pope's shoulders, and fixed in place with three pins to represent the nails on the cross. 
Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines then placed on the pope's finger the Ring of the Fisherman, a symbol of the papacy which bears an image of St Peter.

Ukraine says Russia has launched its biggest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, targeting several regions including Kyiv, where one woman died.
The barrage came just a day before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US President has been urging a ceasefire.
Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years on Friday in Turkey, agreeing a new prisoner swap deal but little else.
Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 273 drones by 08:00 Sunday (05:00 GMT) targeting the central Kyiv region, and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east.
It said 88 drones were intercepted and another 128 went astray ""without negative consequences"". 
The strikes killed one person in Obukhiv district in the Kyiv region, and injured at least three others - one of whom was a four-year-old child - officials reported.
The previous largest drone attack from Russia happened on the third anniversary of the full-scale invasion on 23 February, when Moscow launched 267 drones.
Russia's military said it had intercepted 25 Ukrainian drones overnight and on Sunday morning.
Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Sunday that he and leaders of the UK, France, and Poland would have a virtual meeting with Trump before his conversation with Putin on Monday morning.
The four leaders jointly visited Ukraine over two weeks ago to spearhead calls for a 30-day-ceasefire, backed by the so-called ""coalition of the willing"".
Ukraine's intelligence agency has said it believes Russia could be planning to carry out a ""training and combat"" launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile overnight, as an attempted intimidation.
Russia has not responded to the claim. 
Firefighters at a site outside Kyiv that was hit on Sunday morning 
Ukrainian officials said Saturday night's strikes showed Russia had no intention of stopping the war, despite international pressure for a ceasefire.
""For Russia, the negotiations [on Friday] in Istanbul are just a pretence. Putin wants war,"" said Andriy Yermak, a top aide to the Ukrainian president.
Following the talks in Turkey, Trump had suggested there would be no progress towards peace until he and Putin meet face-to-face. 
The US president has proposed a 30-day ceasefire agreement and threatened tougher sanctions if Russia doesn't comply. 
Ukraine's President Zelensky has said he is ready to accept the proposal for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. 
But Russia will only agree to a pause in fighting if military supplies to Ukraine are halted. 
Putin has also said any negotiations must include discussions about the cause of the war. Russia's terms include Ukraine becoming a neutral country, cutting the size of its military, and abandoning its Nato membership ambitions - conditions that Ukraine has rejected as tantamount to capitulation.
Moscow now controls approximately 20% of Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014.
Zelensky was at the Vatican on Sunday where he had a private meeting with Pope Leo following the new pontiff's inauguration mass. He also briefly met US Vice President JD Vance in Rome.

It comes a day after gardaÃ­ (Irish police) searching a site near Mr Gaine's farm confirmed they had found partial human remains. 
Mr Gaine, 56, has been missing for more than eight weeks. He was initially treated as a missing persons case before it was upgraded to a homicide on 29 April.
The man, in his 50s, is being held in custody as searches and technical examinations at the site near Mr Gaine's farm continue. 
On Saturday, gardaÃ­ said DNA analysis would be carried out on the human remains before they can be identified. 
Mr Gaine, a sheep and cattle farmer, was reported missing from his home near Kenmare on Friday, 21 March. He was last seen in the County Kerry town the previous day.
He lived in the remote Carrig East area close the Molls Gap beauty spot along the renowned Ring of Kerry.
Last month, Michael Gaine's wife Janice told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he ""loved his home, he loved his farm, he loved animals"" adding that his disappearance was ""totally out of character"".
Independent TD (member of the Irish parliament) for Kerry, Michael Healy-Rae, said the local community in Kenmare wants answers.
""We want to know, and the family want to know,"" he told Irish national broadcaster RTÃ.
""Mike was a very respectable, hardworking, genuine man, a great community person and a person that everybody liked.
""To think that somebody would have this type of event happen to them, we're all horrified. We're upset.
""It is not something that we're used to in any part of Ireland. But in this locality, we never had a situation like this before."""

A bomb explosion outside a California fertility clinic has killed one person and injured four others in an ""intentional act of terrorism"", FBI officials have said.  
The blast happened just before 11:00 local time (19:00 BST) less than a mile from downtown Palm Springs, near several businesses including the American Reproductive Centers (ARC). The clinic said no-one from the facility was harmed.
The suspect in the blast has been identified as 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus, according to sources familiar with the investigation who spoke to BBC's US partner CBS News.
Witnesses told the BBC the blast was strong enough to shatter windows and badly damage a nearby building that housed the ARC.
Michael Beaumier, a witness, said he was knocked off his bike by the blast. ""It was that big of an explosion and I could hear windows shattering all around me,"" he said. 
Rhino Williams, who was at his restaurant nearby, told the BBC he initially thought the explosion was a plane or helicopter crashing.
He said he ran to the scene to see if he could help, finding a badly damaged building with walls blown out and the front axle of a car on fire in the car park.
""That's all that was left of it,"" Mr Williams said. He also saw an iPhone on a tripod still standing in the car park, as if it was set to film or stream the explosion.
Mr Williams said he rushed through the building shouting for any injured people - but did not find any. A few minutes later first responders arrived. 
Nima Tabrizi, another witness, said he heard a ""big boom"", a large cloud of smoke and the front of the clinic ""completely blown out"".
The FBI said in a Saturday briefing that it was a deliberate attack. 
""This was an intentional act of terrorism. As our investigation will unfold we will determine if it's international terrorism or domestic terrorism,"" said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.
The FBI later said it had ""a person of interest"" in its investigation, but officers were ""not actively searching"" for the suspect. 
Law enforcement sources told CBS that the Bartkus, the suspect, is a resident of Twentynine Palms, home to a large marine base about an hour away from Palm Springs.
They added that he had stated in writings and recordings that he is opposed to increasing the population and is against in vitro fertilisation (IVF) - a service offered by clinic that was targeted - saying it is ""extremely wrong"".
The blast was a result of a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, the sources said. It was felt more than a mile away from the explosion.
Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills said the blast damaged several buildings, some severely. 
He added that the identity of the person who was killed was not known.
The ARC in Palm Springs said the explosion occurred in the car park near its building. 
The fertility clinic said their lab, including all eggs and embryos, remained ""fully secure and undamaged"".
""We are heavily conducting a complete safety inspection and have confirmed that our operations and sensitive medical areas were not impacted by the blast,"" the clinic said in its statement.
But Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told the Associated Press that the clinic's office was damaged. 
""I really have no clue what happened,"" he said. ""Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.""
According to its website, the ARC clinic is the first full-service fertility centre and IVF lab in the Coachella Valley.
It offers services including fertility evaluations, IVF, egg donation and freezing, reproductive support for same-sex couples and surrogacy. 
The Center for Reproductive Rights responded to the incident, calling the attack ""unconscionable"".
""The history of violence against reproductive health centers is why clinics need protections and patients must feel safe,"" the legal advocacy group said in a statement, adding that it is concerned about ""the heated political debate around fertility treatments"" in the US.
Lawmakers, advocates and medical professionals have clashed over issues of access and regulation of reproductive rights in recent years, making it an election issue in 2024. IVF is broadly popular in the US across the political spectrum, but some far right circles are vocally opposed to assisted reproductive technologies on religious or moral grounds.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state was co-ordinating with local and federal authorities, while US Attorney General Pam Bondi said she had been briefed on the incident."

When Romania's presidential election was annulled late last year after claims of Russian interference, a far-right conspiracy theorist was blocked from the top job.
Many Romanians were deeply relieved; many others were angry their votes had been stolen.
But six months later, with the country back at the ballot box, another hard-right Euro-sceptic is in the running for president.
George Simion won the first round of the new elections on 4 May by a large margin. Now the former football casual turned nationalist politician is facing off against Nicusor Dan, the liberal mayor of Bucharest.
It's a vote that could see Romania, a member of both Nato and the European Union (EU), take a sharp turn away from the European mainstream.
Both candidates cast their votes on Sunday morning, with Simion saying he had voted for the future ""that should be decided only by Romanians, for Romanians and for Romania"".
Dan told reporters he was voting for ""collaboration with our European partners and not for [the] isolation of Romania"".
The polls have been too close to call.
Teleorman county is one of Romania's poorest areas and has been solidly social-democrat territory for many years. But earlier this month, 57% of voters here chose Simion for president in the first round of voting.
Petre Filip shows his original packaging machine, which now stands in the lobby as a reminder of the early days
A couple of hours' drive south-west from Bucharest, entry to the region is announced in blue letters on a rusty metal arch over the main road. 
The streets are lined with wild poppies, not campaign posters for the candidates. There's no obvious sign of the elections.
But social media feeds on people's phones are full of political content.
The latest clip to go viral features a folk fantasy world of embroidered tops, prayers and bears and has the slogan ""I choose Romania"".
""It was an anti-system, anti-mainstream vote,"" is how Felicia Alexandru of Aperio Intelligence explains the nationwide surge of support for the far-right candidate in the first round.
After more than three decades of the same parties dominating politics, frustration with corruption and poor performance has been building.
""People are so unhappy with what happened in high level politics, this is a vote against that,"" Felicia says.
The protest vote is not confined to the poorest or most disaffected.
The Comalat dairy firm is unrecognisable from the business Petre Filip launched 25 years ago.
Back then, he would set out at 05:00 every day in his Dacia to drive round farms buying up milk. Then, each evening, he hand-delivered the cheese and yoghurt produced by his three workers to clients.
His old packaging machine now stands in the lobby as a reminder of the early days. But Petre has since been granted â¬1.5m (Â£1.3m; $1.7m) in EU funding to modernise and expand his business. It's money he never has to pay back.
""That was a really, really good thing for us,"" the businessman enthuses, showing off a production line of glistening metal machines in several rooms.
He employs more than 50 staff.
Mihaela argues that George Simion is ""on the side of Romanians""
""I like George Simion,"" staff member Mihaela announces with a smile, while squeezing liquid from big clumps of curd cheese.
She shrugs when I mention the fear in Brussels that he would make EU-Romania relations very turbulent.
""He's on the side of Romanians. He's for the people. To create jobs and better lives,"" Mihaela replies.
Simion talks a lot about ""making Romania great again"", echoing the MAGA politicians in the US he so admires. He has the same isolationist approach, too: Romania first, in everything.
When pushed, he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal for his invasion of Ukraine. 
But like Donald Trump, he has also pledged to end military aid to Kyiv and he's left the future of Ukraine's vital grain exports via Romania unclear.
Simion has been banned from Ukraine and Moldova for calling for territory there to be part of Romania.
In his latest outbursts this week, he called his election opponent ""autistic, poor guy"".
He also accused French President Emmanuel Macron of having ""dictatorial tendencies"".
Mr Filip says Simion is ""far too impulsive"" to be president, driven ""by hormones not his brain"". 
But he is so disillusioned by the whole scene he's inclined not to vote at all.
Just up the road in RoÈiori de Vede, they are discussing the elections too - and fretting.
Roxana says she likes how Nicusor Dan has managed Bucharest as mayor
Roxana runs a factory making work uniforms, including for the military in another EU country.
Her clients have been calling wondering whether Romania is about to vote for a ""pro-Russian"" president.
""They want to know whether their orders are safe!"" she laughs.
Roxana herself plans to vote for the man people here refer to by his first name, Nicusor, because she likes how he's managed Bucharest as mayor.
She's also deeply disturbed by what she calls Simion's ""hooligan"" behaviour.
""It's such a bad image for Romania in Europe. I am ashamed,"" Roxana says, recalling the candidate's insults about Macron this week.
In another recent incident, Simion threatened to sexually assault a female MP, calling her a pig.
""Compare that with a person who won the International Mathematics Olympiad,"" Roxana says, referring to a competition Dan won in the 1980s. He went on to get a doctorate from the Sorbonne.
Ahead of the second-round vote, Roxana and her friend Andrea have been involved in a grassroots initiative to persuade voters to back Dan.
""I've tried to say why Simion's plan is unfeasible but I don't think I've been super successful,"" Andrea admits, and says she's ""very worried"".
""I see what people are saying online and they really believe in Simion and think he's going to shake everything up and take down the system.
""They think it's all bad, but it's not.""
Her own candidate, Dan, is emphatically pro-EU and pro-Nato, and his campaign slogan is ""honesty"".
""I don't promise miracles,"" is his modest election pledge. ""But I promise I will fight.""
If that fight fails, and Simion wins, he won't be the only hard-right candidate at the forefront of Romanian politics.
Much of his support comes from those who originally voted for Calin Georgescu, the fringe figure who won the first election in November before it was cancelled on national security grounds.
The two men have often appeared side-by-side since then - including when they voted today - and Simion has pledged to make Georgescu prime minister if he is elected. 
It's unclear how that could work, given that he was accused of benefiting from ""massive"" and ""aggressive"" meddling by Moscow.
""If Simion wins then there will be chaos in politics from Monday,"" Roxana predicts, including for the economy.
""The question is whether he stays in the shadow of Georgescu, or completely changes perspective,"" Felicia agrees.
""Is this a campaign strategy, or what he believes in?"""

The first round of voting is on Sunday, with polling stations located in Bedford, Dunstable, Watford and Welwyn Hatfield.
The president is elected for five years using the two-round system, meaning that if no candidate gets 50% of the vote in the first round this weekend, then a second round will take place on 1 June.
Presidents can only be re-elected once, meaning incumbent Andrzej Duda of the Law and Justice party has stood down, and the country's seventh president will be elected in his place.
In 2023, when Poland held its last local elections, a record 608,000 voters from outside the country were registered as an estimated five million Polish citizens now live abroad.
That includes 700,000 in the UK, and there will be more than 100 different places to vote across the country.

Two people have been killed and at least 19 others injured after a tall Mexican Navy training sailing ship crashed into New York City's Brooklyn Bridge.
Police said the CuauhtÃ©moc, with 277 people on board, lost power on Saturday as the captain was manoeuvring the vessel, forcing it to head for the bridge abutment on the Brooklyn side.
Footage shows the ship's towering masts clip the bridge as it passed under the structure. Crew members were standing on the masts as they snapped and fell to the deck, authorities said.
Brooklyn resident Nick Corso, who witnessed the accident, said the area erupted in panic. There was ""lots of screaming, some sailors hanging from the masts,"" he told AFP.
Damaged masts on the Mexican Navy training ship CuauhtÃ©moc after it crashed into New York City's Brooklyn Bridge
New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed on X that two people died and two of the 19 injured were in critical condition.
Brooklyn Bridge did not suffer any major damage and was reopened after a preliminary inspection. 
Police said they believed ""mechanical malfunction"" and a power cut had caused the collision.
The New York Coast Guard said the CuauhtÃ©moc lost all three masts. All personnel on the ship had been accounted for and no-one had fallen in the water.
Crowds fled from the water's edge as the ship hit the bridge.
Another witness, Kelvin Flores, told the BBC he was at work when he saw the crash.
He came out into the street to find a lot of ""commotion and a lot of chaos"" with fire engines and police trying to reach the scene but the roads clogged with traffic. 
""Just seeing the actual damage was insane,"" he said. ""People carrying stretchers...  they were trying to get the injured out."" 
Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said she was deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members in the accident.
The CuauhtÃ©moc was towed from the scene after the crash.
The vessel, which measures 297 feet long (91m) and 40 feet (12m) wide, according to the Mexican navy, sailed for the first time in 1982. 
Each year it sets sail at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets' training.
This year it left the Mexican port of Acapulco on 6 April, the navy said. Its final destination was intended to be Iceland. Among its scheduled stops along the way was Aberdeen, Scotland, for the city's Tall Ships race in July.
Police said the CuauhtÃ©moc's mast height was 48.2m (158ft). The New York transport department's website says the bridge has a 135ft clearance at its centre."

""How much is that,"" a man in purple trousers yelled towards her, the glassware inches above her eyebrow clanking as she paused. 
""Twenty dollars,"" she replied.
Ray De Rubin repeated the number in disbelief, mumbled an expletive under his breath, then said: ""I'll take two.""
He and his mother were at Pimlico for the first time - here to wager on US horse racing's esteemed Preakness Stakes on its 150th anniversary. Just two weeks ago, during his 14th trip to the Kentucky Derby, he won big. 
""This is the exact same outfit I wore on Derby day. Same underwear, same socks, same hat,"" he said. ""I still got my Derby wristband on.""
His wager at Pimlico? ""I can't tell you. I don't want the IRS coming after me,"" he said with a grin.
On the other side of Pimlico â just beyond the thousand-dollar seats, champagne flutes, and air-conditioned tents on the infield â five thoroughbreds idled behind the  starting line. Mr De Rubin had bets on three of them. 
There was a brief moment of quiet before the race. Then the gates flung open, and the horses took off. Mr De Rubin, eyes fixed on the screens above, stood frozen. But only for a moment.
""I get really loud when I watch the race. I put a lot of work into this,"" he said.
Ray De Rubin scans through the betting app on his iPad inside Pimlico's clubhouse
One of three annual thoroughbred races - along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes - that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, its traditions have been thrown into question.
In his second term as president, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to historic consumer pessimism. Virtually no corner of the American market has been spared - from the fast-food hamburger to the Preakness Stakes.
Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America"". Instead, in the 48 hours after his announcement, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day sell-off in years, as trillions of dollars were wiped from the stock market.
Three weeks later, the International Monetary Fund warned of a global recession. Even McDonald's reported a drop in sales, which the burger chain's CEO attributed to customers ""grappling with uncertainty"".  But while the stock market has mostly recovered following tariff agreements with the UK and China, the tariffs' impact may be just beginning; mega corporations like Walmart and Amazon recently warned of price increases.
But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility.
The tariffs' shadow looms here, too. ""We expect there to be some kind of impact,"" the Maryland Stadium Authority told the BBC in a statement. But for now, they said the effects on the half-billion dollar project remain unclear.
Aside from tariffs, horse race attendance has shrunk in recent years. Just over 46,000 people attended the Preakness in 2024, down from the 131,000 that attended in 2019. The Derby drew a much larger crowd of roughly 150,000 this year but was still well under its peak of 170,000 in 2015.
Bill Carstanjen, CEO of the Derby's home, Churchill Downs, said a dip in sales this year was due to buyer ""hesitancy"" that ""correlates perfectly"" with Trump's tariffs.
""We didn't have the endless pool of demand that we've seen in prior years,"" Mr Carstanjen told the Lexington Herald.
Still, gambling records this year were broken at the Derby and Preakness. Over a week before the Preakness and before the horses running were finalised, a Preakness record of $348,000 was wagered on betting futures, up from last year's record of $260,000. All just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions that will be wagered by the time the last horse crosses the finish line. 
University of Kansas economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling could also be a sign of economic distress.
""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said.
""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release.""
Anthony Walker is attending his first Preakness Stakes
Waiting in a long line on Pimlico's infield, Anthony Walker was among those looking for ""a little reprieve"".
He was glad ""to be able to take a few hours away from all that instability"" in the stock market as well as the disruption caused by Trump's downsizing of the federal government.
Mr Walker planned to gamble â ""you can't come to the race without putting a little something out there"" â but a bit less than he might have in more certain times.
""I'm wagering 50% less, for sure,"" he estimated. ""Because of what's happening in the economy â the way this administration is taking a wrecking ball to the longstanding traditions and institutions that give credence to the American way of life.""
At the Preakness, there are still endless ways to get a quick dose of gambling-induced dopamine. Even for as little as 10 cents.
""I've seen a 10 cent (wager) pay $75,000,"" said Peter Rotondo, who heads racing and wagering for 1/ST, the organisation running Preakness.
To do so, one would have to wager on what's called a superfecta: correctly guessing which four horses will place in the top four in the exact order, odds that are about on par with getting struck by lightning.
""That's the beauty of the super,"" Mr Rotondo said.
The pricey cocktail Mr De Rubin grumbled about was the Black-Eyed Susan, also Maryland's official flower. The crazed concoction - bourbon, vodka, and a splash of mixers - leaves one to wonder whether it's truly a tribute to the state flower or a wink to the likely black eye after having too many.
The drink is one of many traditions at the annual event. There's also the decades-old Tiffany & Co-made trophy called the Woodlawn Vase, considered ""the most valuable trophy in sports"". Made of 30lb of sterling silver, it's valued at an estimated $4m (Â£3m), and thus is kept in a museum most of the year. The Preakness winner leaves with a replica.
But for many, the Preakness wouldn't be the Preakness without the party on the infield.
""I went a lot in my 20s and 30s. It was an absolutely crazy party,"" Bobby Duke, 51, said in an email to the BBC. ""In 1998, a guy jumped the fence and tried to punch a horse while racing. It's on YouTube.""
Though Pimlico always had offerings for the elegant, fans like Mr Duke fondly remember piling into the infield for ""the most salacious party on the sports calendar"", as ESPN once put it, where patrons would race across a long row of porta-pottys while dodging beer cans hurled at them by inebriated onlookers. (That tradition ended around 2009, when Pimlico stopped its BYOB policy.)
Maryland officials said the new Pimlico will become a year-round racing facility, and hopefully bring an economic boost to the low-income Park Heights neighbourhood surrounding it. 
In his purple pants and every-colour-of-the-rainbow shirt, Mr De Rubin grew agitated as his luck began to unravel during the five-horse race.
""(Horse number five) is dead last. I don't think they're going to catch this,"" he said with growing animation, rattling the ice in his Black-Eyed Susan. He placed bets on horses one, three and five.
""Oh, (crap), the three horse. Here comes the one horse. Come on, one!""
In a span of about three minutes, the anticipation, anxiety, fear and hope all came crashing to an end. Mr De Rubin didn't win. But he didn't lose either. The even spread on the winning horse basically gave him back what he put into it.
He compared the experience to today's seesaw stock market.
""Investing, and betting on horses, is gambling. You have ups and downs,"" he said.
His stock portfolio has taken a wild downward spin through Trump's global tariff tit-for-tat. But recently it sprang back into the green and is up around 20%, he said.
Unlike the horses, ""you can't watch the market. It'll give you a heart attack"", he advised.
""I have faith in Trump. He's a little crazy with it right now, but it'll all work out."""

At a time when women's participation in the film industry was frowned upon, a young woman dared to dream differently.
In 1920s pre-independence India, PK Rosy became the first female lead in Malayalam-language cinema, in what is now the southern state of Kerala.
She starred in a movie called Vigathakumaran, or The Lost Child, in the 1920s. But instead of being remembered as a pioneer, her story was buried - erased by caste discrimination and social backlash. 
Rosy belonged to a lower-caste community and faced intense criticism for portraying an upper-caste woman in Vigathakumaran. 
Almost a hundred years later, there is no surviving evidence of Rosy's role. The film's reel was destroyed and the cast and crew have all died. 
Only a few pictures of the film from a contested press release, external dated October 1930 survive, along with an unverified black-and-white photo popularised by local newspapers as Rosy's only portrait.
Even a Google Doodle celebrating her 120th birthday, external used an illustration similar to the woman in the photograph. But Rosy's nephew and others who have researched her life told the BBC that they could not conclusively say that it is her in the picture.  
PK Rosy was born as Rajamma in the early 1900s in the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, now Kerala.
She belonged to a family of grass cutters from the Pulaya community, part of the Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's harsh caste hierarchy and have been historically oppressed.
""People from the Pulaya community were considered slave labour and auctioned off with land,"" says Malavika Binny, a professor of history at Kannur University. 
""They were considered the 'lowliest'. They were flogged, raped, tied to trees and set on fire for any so-called transgressions,"" she adds. 
Despite the dire social challenges, Rosy chose to dream differently. 
A scene in Vigathakumaran showed the hero picking a flower from the heroine's hair and kissing it
She was supported by her uncle, who was a theatre artist himself, and with his help Rosy entered the field of entertainment. 
""There are few available facts about Rosy's life, but it is known that she was popular for her performances in local plays,"" says Vinu Abraham, the author of The Lost Heroine, a novel based on Rosy's life.
While her acting skills earned admiration, it was rare for a Dalit woman to take up acting at the time.
""She was likely aware of the fact that this was a new arena and making herself visible was important,"" says Prof Binny.
She soon became a well-known figure in local theatre circles and her talent caught the eye of director JC Daniel, who was then searching for a lead actor for his film - a character named Sarojini. 
Daniel was aware of Rosy's caste identity and chose to cast her in the role. 
""She was paid five rupees a day for 10 days of filming,"" said Mr Abraham. ""This was a substantial amount of money in the 1920s.""
On the day of the film's premiere, Rosy and her family were barred from attending the screening.
They were stopped because they were Dalits, Rosy's nephew Biju Govindan says. 
And so began a chain of events that pushed Rosy out of the public eye and her home.
""The crowd that came to watch the movie were provoked by two things: Rosy playing an upper-caste woman and the hero picking a flower from her hair and kissing it in one scene,"" said Mr Abraham.
""They started throwing rocks at the screen and chased Daniel away,"" he added.
There are differing accounts of the extent of the damage to the theatre but what is clear is the toll the incident took on both Rosy and Daniel.
Buried in debt after the failure of his film Vigathakumaran, JC Daniel never made another movie
Daniel had spent a lot of money to establish a studio and gather resources to produce the film, and was heavily debt-ridden. Facing immense social and financial pressure, the director, who is now widely regarded as the father of Malayalam cinema, never made another film. 
Rosy fled her hometown after an angry mob set her house on fire.
She cut all ties with her family to avoid being recognised and never spoke publicly about her past. She rebuilt her life by marrying an upper-caste man and took the name Rajammal.
She lived the rest of her life in obscurity in the town of Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, Mr Abraham says.  
Her children refused to accept that PK Rosy, the Dalit actor, was their mother, Rosy's nephew Mr Govindan says. 
""Her children were born with an upper-caste Kesavan Pillai's identity. They chose their father's seed over their mother's womb,"" he says. 
""We, her family, are part of PK Rosy's Dalit identity before the film's release,"" he said.
""In the space they inhabit, caste restricts them from accepting their Dalit heritage. That is their reality and our family has no place in it."" 
In 2013, a Malayalam TV channel, external tracked down Rosy's daughter Padma, who was living in financial strain somewhere in Tamil Nadu. She told them that she did not know much about her mother's life before her marriage but that she did not act after that. 
The BBC made attempts to contact Rosy's children, but their relatives said they were not comfortable with the attention.
Prof Binny says that the erasure of Rosy's legacy shows how deeply caste-based trauma can run.
""It can be so intense that it shapes or defines the rest of one's life,"" she says, adding that she is glad Rosy eventually found a safe space.
In recent years, Dalit filmmakers and activists have sought to reclaim Rosy's legacy. Influential Tamil director Pa Ranjith has launched a yearly film festival in her name which celebrates Dalit cinema. A film society, external and foundation have also been established. 
But there is still a haunting sense that while Rosy was ultimately saved, it was at the cost of her passion and identity.
""Rosy prioritised survival over art and, as a result, never tried to speak publicly or reclaim her lost identity. That's not her failure - it's society's,"" says Mr Govindan.

333,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79ed21xyyro,2025-05-18 00:35:01,"Pop culture re-invented the Menendez brothers - now their fate may rest with one man,","It was once unthinkable that Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, would get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses.
Their claims of sexual abuse at the hands of their father were mocked by prosecutors and comedians alike, from late-night TV to jokes at the Academy Awards. 
But 35 years later - thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters - many who were not even born in 1989, the year the brothers ambushed their parents with shotguns in their Beverly Hills mansion.
At the time of their trials, the brothers were portrayed as greedy, entitled monsters who went on a $700,000 (Â£526,0000) spending spree in the weeks after the murders. Now, with a growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse, many are more sympathetic - and that might just give the brothers a chance at freedom.
This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month. 
Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will be weighing the shifting public opinion about the divisive case with his own political ambitions.
In 1989, Erik and Lyle Menendez burst into their Beverly Hills living room, both toting loaded shotguns, and opened fire on their parents, who were watching television. The crime would go unsolved for months.
They got tickets for the James Bond film License to Kill as an alibi and told law enforcement and members of the news media, who were covering the execution of the wealthy, high-powered couple in their mansion, that perhaps the mafia was to blame.
Meanwhile, they bought a new Porsche, Jeep, Rolex watches and other luxury items with cash from their parents' estate.
They weren't caught until police got word of their admissions to a psychologist.
Even at the time, their crime was divisive - the first trial ended un a mistrial after the jury couldn't reach a verdict. After the second, they were sentenced to life without parole.
During both trials, the brothers were characterised as bad boys and spoiled children who were motivated to kill their parents out of hatred and hopes to acquire their $14 million estate. 
Saturday Night Live and other late-night shows mocked the pair's defence in court â including tearful testimony about their alleged sexual abuse, which prosecutors dubbed the ""abuse excuse"" - and documentary titles from that decade included phrases like ""the bad sons"" and ""American sons, American murderers"".
Appeal after appeal was denied but last year, everything seemed to change. New evidence about the alleged sexual abuse had surfaced and Netflix released a drama that captured the attention of a whole new generation. Soon, documentaries about the case included titles with words like ""misjudged"" and ""boys betrayed"".
TikTokers discussed the case with their followers. Reality star Kim Kardashian, a criminal justice advocate who has helped free imprisoned people, penned an opinion piece publicly backing their bid for freedom.
""Back then, there were limited resources for victims of sexual abuse, particularly for boys,"" Kardashian wrote in the NBC piece. 
In the 1990s, society did not have the same understanding we do today of trauma, sexual abuse and harassment, Whitney Phillips, a University of Oregon professor who studies true crime, told the BBC. That gap in understanding was especially pronounced for boys who were abused, she added.
But after the MeToo movement, there was more cultural space created for people to speak about these experiences, she said.
""Not only does it create a permission structure,"" Prof Phillips said of people feeling encouraged to speak out about harassment and abuse, ""in some ways it creates an incentive structure to feature stories about trauma"".
Adding to that is the change in how the public views criminal justice, with more emphasis on rehabilitation and reducing prison populations instead of the tough-on-crime mentality that dominated Los Angeles at the end of the 20th Century.
""The lock people up forever attitude of the 1990s is fortunately long gone,"" said Robert Rand, a journalist who met and interviewed the brothers before they were arrested and uncovered new evidence in 2018 - a letter Erik had written as a teenager to a cousin about his father's sexual abuse. 
In a documentary Mr Rand produced about the killings, released in 2023, a former member of the boy band called Menudo alleged that the brothers' father, Jose Menendez - who was an executive at RCA Records - had raped him when he was 14 years old. The accusation further bolstered the brothers' claims of abuse.
The new testimonies helped give new life to the brothers' claims, and provided a catalyst for what Prof Phillips called a ""hurricane"" of interest and support, from the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed. 
""The things that get really big online are things that have lots of sources of energy,"" she said.
Even Lyle Menendez noted the sea change.
""The followers who are younger that are on that sort of TikTok social media generation, they really have tremendous hope,"" Lyle Menendez said at a court hearing.
""I'm not as hopeless as I was as a 21-year-old, that's for sure. Obviously, I feel more hope when society seems to be understanding these experiences and sex abuse better.""
The fate of the brothers rests with California Gov Gavin Newsom, who is thought to be a potential US presidential contender
The fate of the brothers â regardless of what social media,  the courts or California's parole board recommends â ultimately rests with one man: Governor Newsom, who has the power to accept or reject any parole recommendation.
And many believe that man is considering a run for president in 2028. 
Since the last election, Newsom has been undergoing a political transformation, shifting from crusading liberal pushing universal healthcare to a more moderate, pragmatic approach, most recently proposing freezing healthcare for undocumented immigrants.
Weighing in on such a divisive case could be ""risky"", said Pennsylvania-based Republican political strategist Sam Chen.
""Can you imagine a reality TV show of the Menendez brothers while Newsom is trying to run for president? Talk about free campaign airtime,"" he said. ""That would be the worst thing for him.""
Although no one knows which way he is leaning, Newsom has mentioned the case several times on social media and on his podcast.
""The question for the board is a rather simple one,"" Newsom said in February on TikTok.  ""Do they pose a current, what we call 'unreasonable' risk to public safety.""
Mr Rand acknowledged the case is ""risky"" politically for Newsom.
""You can't get around the elephant in the room: They brutally murdered their parents,"" Rand told the BBC. ""But if you do believe that they were abused and that they suffered from a lifetime of abuse - and there actually is evidence that supports their story - it's a very different situation.""
The brothers have not committed violent crimes while in prison, a fact the judge in their resentencing hearing considered, although they did have infractions for using cell phones smuggled into prison. 
They've also led productive lives while incarcerated, with Erik founding a hospice programme to help elderly and disabled inmates while Lyle has been working on prison beautification. 
Remarkably, every single surviving member of their family â from cousins to aunts and uncles - want the Menendez brothers released, including the surviving siblings of Jose and Kitty Menendez. 
""They chose to live their lives with clarity and a purpose of service,"" their cousin Anamaria Baralt said outside the court after they were resentenced.
If the board recommends parole in June, the governor has 30 days to accept or reject the recommendation. If they are paroled, the brothers will be released likely within five months, according to the California Department of Corrections.
The fact that Gov Newsom ordered the state parole board to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment before the brothers were even deemed eligible for parole has many thinking he's open to releasing them.
""He wants the political cover"" of the parole board and court recommendations, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who has been following the brothers' legal saga but is not representing any of the participants. 
A year ago, Mr Rahmani never would have predicted the Menendez brothers could be released. Now he thinks they will be free within the next few months.
But it wouldn't be unprecedented for Gov Newsom to reject a high-profile parole recommendation.
Several times he blocked the release of a Manson Family member. And in 2022, Newsom blocked the release of Sirhan Sirhan, the man who assassinated Sen Robert F Kennedy.
As far as the Menendez brothers go, Gov Newsom said on his podcast that he's mulling over the case and he's not planning to watch any of the documentaries or true crime dramas about the case.
""I'm obviously familiar with the Menendez brothers just through the news over the course of many decades, but not to the degree that many others are because of all of these documentaries and all of the attention they've received,"" he said. ""So that won't bias my independent and objective review of the facts."""
334,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ygvn5g452o,2025-05-17 23:24:46,"New era beckons for Air Force One after Qatari offer - but what's it like inside?,","Most journalists travelling with the US president don't see much of the interior of Air Force One, the presidential jet. 
The press cabin is in the back of the plane, accessible by a rear set of steps and a quick turn of a corner.
To reach the presidential suite at the front of the plane would require negotiating with the armed Secret Service agents in the next-door cabin.
On Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, when the future of the famous plane was a huge talking point, Fox News host Sean Hannity had priority seating and access to the president to conduct an in-flight interview. 
But the rest of us in the travelling press pool were consigned to our small section of the plane.
It was a whirlwind trip, hitting three nations in three nights, half a world away. The president described it as an ""endurance test"" - one that his staff and those of us in the press pool had to manage, as well.
The presidential jet is not a bad way to fly, however. The 14 seats are comfortable, roughly on par with a first-class domestic flight. 
There's a bathroom and a table with snacks (including the coveted Air Force One-branded M&Ms bearing the president's signature, which aren't available anywhere else).
Qatar's Air Force One offer angers Trump supporters
Is Trump allowed to accept 747 gift?
The cabin has a pair of television monitors - usually tuned to the president's preferred cable news channel (CNN during Joe Biden's term; Fox News for Trump). On occasion, they've been set to a football game or other sporting events.
For longer flights, the on-board kitchen serves plated meals (the president eats from a different, fancier menu). On short hops, there's usually food in a takeaway bag.
But the interior of this famous aircraft could soon undergo a radical refit if, as looks likely, Trump accepts the Qatari offer to supply a new ""palace in the sky"" - the biggest foreign gift ever received by a US president.
Technically, ""Air Force One"" is a radio call sign, the designation for any Air Force aircraft with the US president aboard. The small prop plane Lyndon Baines Johnson took from Austin to his Texas ranch in the 1960s was Air Force One, too.
But the Air Force One most people picture, the one featured in the Harrison Ford action film, is the Boeing 747-200b with water blue, steel blue and white paint set against a chrome underbody - a colour scheme picked out by First Lady Jackie Kennedy in 1962.
Currently there are two of these 747s in the Air Force passenger fleet, in use since 1990. Needless to say, technology â both in aircraft design and everything else â has come a long way in the ensuing years. The planes have been upgraded, but the costs of maintaining the airframe and engines are growing. The aircraft are showing their age.
This has clearly irked the current White House occupant â the only president to own his own jet, or for that matter, his own airline, prior to taking office.
""I leave now and get onto a 42-year-old Boeing,"" he said, exaggerating the plane's age during an industry briefing on Thursday in Abu Dhabi. ""But new ones are coming.""
Coming, but not soon enough for Trump. During his first term, he touted an updated presidential aircraft, made by Boeing, that was in the works. He even picked out his own colour palette, scrapping Kennedy's design for a red-white-and-blue livery. He proudly displays a model of that jet in the Oval Office.
Originally planned to be delivered by 2021, delays and cost overruns for the estimated $4bn construction programme have made it less likely that the two new planes on order will be available for much, if any, of Trump's second term in office, which expires in January 2029. 
He has tasked tech multi-billionaire Elon Musk with speeding up the process and reportedly groused in private that he is embarrassed to travel in such an outdated plane.

That explains why the president has become enamoured with the prospect of a seemingly more immediate solution to his air transport woes â courtesy of the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar.
News of Qatar's offer of a lavish $400m (Â£301m) 747-8 made headlines last week, but the gift apparently has been in the works for months. 
Trump surreptitiously visited the aircraft in question in mid-February, just a few weeks after the start of his second term in office.
Aside from the legal and ethical concerns of such a substantial gift â raised by critics and some allies of the president - converting a foreign 747 for use by an American president creates a number of technical challenges. 
The aircraft would have to be made capable of in-flight refuelling and retrofitted with a sophisticated package of communications and security equipment. The current models have systems built to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion.
President Obama making calls on board in 2012
Such a refitting process, says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, would take years, until 2030 at least.
""They have to assume the jet has been left unattended in a dangerous place for 13 years,"" he says. ""Which means it's not enough to take the plane apart. You also have to take every single component apart.""
The plane would need additional power to run its new systems, and its interior might have to be rearranged. Chances are there's no press cabin in the flying palace as originally designed.
Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn (Â£750m).
He adds, however, that Trump could waive some, or all, of the security modifications if he so chooses.
""He's the president,"" he said.
When the Air Force ultimately does retire its current crop of 747s, it will put to pasture an aircraft that have been part of fabric of American history for decades. One that transported President Bill Clinton, along with former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush, to Israel for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995.
After the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, George W Bush took to the skies in Air Force One and stayed aloft for hours, refuelling mid-air, until his security team determined it was safe for him to land and address the nation, before ultimately returning to Washington.

Six US presidents have travelled on these jets, criss-crossing the US and visiting all corners of the globe. One took Biden to Israel just days after the 7 October attack by Hamas.
Trump has effectively employed the aircraft as a campaign device, holding political rallies at airfields and making low-speed passes over the crowds before landing and using Air Force One as a dramatic backdrop for his speeches.
On Trump's recent Mid East trip, military fighters from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE accompanied Air Force One as it flew through their national airspace.
Aging though it may be, Air Force One is still one of the most recognisable signs of American presidential authority and power in the world - a military aircraft that serves a higher purpose.
""It's not made for luxury,"" says Aboulafia. ""It's a flying command post. You're not there to throw parties.""

335,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c629664xp57o,2025-05-17 23:16:57,"'You start to go crazy': The Australian who survived five years in a Chinese prison,","Australian Matthew Radalj was held for five years in a Beijing detention centre, similar to the one pictured above in 2012
Sharing a dirty cell with a dozen others, constant sleep deprivation, cells with lights on 24-hours a day; poor hygiene and forced labour. These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison â a facility used for international inmates.
Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labour, food deprivation and psychological torture.
The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was. 
Many requested anonymity, because they feared retribution on loved ones still living inside the country. Others said they just wanted to try to forget the experience and move on.
The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.
""I was in really bad shape when I arrived. They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in. I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,"" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020.
The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen.
He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration.
Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence.
Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal ""transition phase"".
Radalj had lived in Beijing for a number of years when he was arrested in January 2020
During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions.
""We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us.""
Eventually he was admitted to the ""normal"" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off.
You also ate in the same room, he said.
According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules.
Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture.
One of these was the ""good behaviour points system"" which was a way â at least in theory â to reduce your sentence.
Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time.
If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work.
Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation.
He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time.
These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking ""incorrectly"" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window.
The gates to Beijing No. 2 prison, pictured in 2012, where Radlj was held
Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits.
Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions.
""There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,"" he said. ""If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell.
""There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.""
One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence.
Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system.
So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure.
These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits.
But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food.
The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat. 
They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added.
Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition â and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week â that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou.
Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their ""accounts"": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste.
They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this ""privilege"" could be taken away.
Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party.
Media were given rare access to see inside another Beijing prison - No 1 - back in 2012
To make things worse, they were made to work on a ""farm"", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them.
Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was.
But, he said, it was all for show.
""We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then â at the end of the season â they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,"" he added.
""And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months.""
Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison.  
Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: ""The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed.""
Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue.
The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and ""were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas"", he said.
Radalj, pictured with his father, says he has a responsibility to those still imprisoned  
Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items.
This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 days after hitting another prisoner.
Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem.
His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year.
""You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to doâ¦ So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big.
""After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'.""
Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: ""It's none of your business."" 
Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake ""propaganda"" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there.
He said, at one point, a ""computer suite"" was set up. ""They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers.""
The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just ""pretend"".
""Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,"" Radalj said.
But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again.
Radalj  kept a journal in prison (pictured) detailing his time behind bars
Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released.
""I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smallerâ¦ smaller!'.""
Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail.
Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked.
So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families.
""I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.""
He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing.
But he couldn't keep it down.
The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, ""Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?""
So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead.
When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest.
There was a tear in the lining of his jacket and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him.
Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left.
""Did you forget something?"" the guards asked.
""They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges.""
But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside.
""They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check.""
The notes were still there.
Radalj married his long-time girlfriend after finally making it back home
Just before he had boarded the plane in Beijing a policeman who had escorted him to the gate had used Radalj's boarding pass to buy duty free cigarettes for his mates.
""He said don't come back to China. You're banned for 10 years. And I said 'yeah cool. Don't smoke. It's bad for your health'"".
The officer laughed.
He arrived back in Australia and hugged his father at Perth airport. The tears were flowing.
Then he got married to his long-time girlfriend and now they spend their days making candles and other products.
Radalj says he is still angry about his experience and has a long way to go to recover properly.
But he is making his way through the contact list of his former inmate friends â ""I have spent the best part of six months contacting their families, lobbying their embassies so they might try to do a better job of helping them during their incarceration.""
Some of them, he said, haven't spoken to people back home for nearly a decade. And helping them has also helped with the transition back to his old life.
""With freedom comes a great sense of gratitude,"" Radalj says. ""You have a deeper appreciation for the very simplest things in life. But I also have a great sense of responsibility to the people I left behind in prison."""

About 140,000 properties in Missouri and Kentucky were left without power as of Saturday afternoon. Officials in St Louis said the fire department was conducting house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas.
St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said in an update on Saturday that at least 38 people were reported injured in her area, largely from collapsed buildings and toppled trees.
Authorities in Kentucky said there were also severe injuries reported. ""The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,"" said Laurel County Sheriff John Root in a post on social media.
National Weather Service radar suggested the tornado touched down in Missouri shortly after 14:30 local time in the west of the city close to Forest Park - home to St Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 Olympic Games.
St Louis Fire Department said three people had to be rescued after part of the nearby Centennial Christian Church collapsed. One of those people died.
A curfew was imposed from 21:00 to 06:00 local time in the two areas where most of the damage took place, to prevent injuries from debris and reduce the potential for looting.
St Louis mayor Spencer said: ""The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous.
""We're going to have a lot of work to do in the coming days. There is no doubt there, but tonight we are focused on saving lives and keeping people safe and allowing our community to grieve.""
The US National Weather Service said tornadoes also hit neighbouring Illinois, with more severe weather conditions stretching eastwards to the Atlantic coast. On Saturday, it warned of few tornadoes that could hit northern Texas over the weekend as a result of strong to severe storms in the area.
The tornadoes struck an area of the US that is generally referred to as ""Tornado Alley"", where tornadoes are most frequent. They typically occur in the months of May and June, though they could strike during other times of the year.
Kentucky has seen an average of five tornadoes each May since the year 2000, while Missouri has seen an average of 16.

Police searching for missing County Kerry farmer Michael Gaine have found partial human remains at a field close to his farmyard. 
Mr Gaine, 56, has been missing for more than eight weeks and he was initially treated as a missing persons case before it was upgraded to a homicide on 29 April.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) designated a site near to Mr Gaine's farm, in Kenmare, as a crime scene on Friday and have been conducting technical and forensic examinations.
They said DNA analysis will be carried out to make a formal identification of the remains, while searches continue at the site. 
Investigation teams in Kenmare, County Kerry 
Mr Gaine, a sheep and cattle farmer, was reported missing from his home near Kenmare on Friday, 21 March. He was last seen in the County Kerry town the previous day.
He lived in the remote Carrig East area close the Molls Gap beauty spot along the renowned Ring of Kerry.
Last month, Michael Gaine's wife Janice told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he ""loved his home, he loved his farm, he loved animals"" adding that his disappearance was ""totally out of character"".
According to RTÃ, in-depth investigations by gardaÃ­ ruled out ""innocent"" explanations, such as a medical event, an accident, or that he left the area voluntarily. 
A missing person's investigation operates on the basis of consent, but when gardaÃ­ announced the re-classification of their investigation, it meant the range of options in front of the investigation team significantly increased.
They could then get search warrants, clear areas of interest and seize and examine certain items like phones and laptops."

The US president said on Truth Social that the call would take place at 10:00 EDT (14:00 GMT) and he would then speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the leaders of some Nato countries.
On Sunday, Putin reiterated his demand that any peace deal with Ukraine should ""eliminate the causes that triggered this crisis"" and ""guarantee Russia's security"".
Russia and Ukraine were unable to reach any breakthrough in their first face-to-face talks in three years in Istanbul on Friday.
Trump had offered to attend the talks in Turkey if Putin would also be there, but the Russian president declined to go.
Trump's comments come after he suggested progress on ending the war would only happen if he and Putin held face-to-face talks.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russian news agencies that preparations were under way for a call between Putin and Trump on Monday. The two leaders have held a phone call before on the topic.
""The conversation is in the works,"" Peskov told Tass news agency.
Trump had said on Truth Social: ""Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.""
European leaders have been calling for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the conflict.
The US and Russian leaders are expected to discuss a ceasefire, as well as the possible summit between themselves. 
Moscow has moved slower than Trump would like, but it welcomed the American efforts at mediation, in a call on Saturday between the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.
The Istanbul talks were the first direct meeting between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in more than three years
Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Following the talks in Istanbul, Ukraine also reiterated its call for a full and unconditional ceasefire.
According to a Ukrainian official, the Kremlin had made ""new and unacceptable demands including insisting Kyiv withdraw its troops from large parts of its own territory"", he said, in exchange for a ceasefire.
The head of the Russian delegation, Putin aide Vladimir Medinsky, said they were satisfied with the talks and ready to continue contact.
Hours later, a Russian drone hit a passenger bus in the Sumy region, killing nine people - prompting Zelensky to demand stiffer sanctions on Moscow.
He said the attack on the bus was ""a deliberate killing of civilians"". Russia has not commented, but state media reported that forces had hit a ""military staging area"" in Sumy province.
On Sunday, the Ukrainian air force said Russia had launched ""273 Shahed attack drones and various types of imitator drones"", of which 88 were destroyed and 128 more went astray ""without negative consequences"". One woman was killed in Kyiv."

Nine people have been killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian minibus in north-eastern Ukraine, officials say.
Regional military leaders said seven others were also injured in the attack on Saturday morning in Bilopillia as a minibus travelled to Sumy, the regional capital close to Russia's border.
The strike occurred just hours after Russia and Ukraine held their first face-to-face talks in more than three years. Little was achieved but a prisoner swap was agreed.  
Ukraine president Volodymr Zelensky said the attack on the bus was ""a deliberate killing of civilians"". Russia has not commented but state media reported that forces had hit a ""military staging area"" in the Sumy province.
Zelensky said Russian forces ""could not help but understand what kind of vehicle they were hitting"".
He said a family - a mother, father and their daughter - were among those killed in the attack.  
Citing preliminary information, Sumy's regional head Oleh Hryhorov said the bus was hit by a Russian Lancet drone at 06:17 local time on Saturday (03:17 GMT). He described the attack as ""inhumane"".
Friday's talks in Istanbul, Turkey, did not lead to any breakthrough as Ukraine and Russia remain far apart on how to end the war. 
However, it was agreed that each side would return 1,000 prisoners of war to the other in the coming days. 
Zelensky said of the talks that ""as on any day of this war, there was an opportunity to cease fire. Ukraine has been offering this for a long time"".
The bus was hit in the town of Bilopillia, Ukrainian officials say
Following the Istanbul discussions, Ukraine reiterated its call for a full and unconditional ceasefire but a deal with Russia remained elusive.
Ukraine said the next step in the process would be direct talks between Zelensky and Russia's president Vladimir Putin.
Russia said it had ""taken notice"" of the request.
The US has claimed that progress on ending the war would only be made if President Donald Trump and Putin held face-to-face talks. 
During a visit to the Middle East, Trump told reporters on Air Force One ""nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together"".
""He wasn't going if I wasn't there and I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,"" Trump added.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Ukraine used Sumy to launch offensives into Russia's Kursk region in August. Russia drove the majority of Ukraine's troops back earlier this year and has intensified cross-border artillery and air attacks in recent months.
Earlier this week before talks began with Ukraine, Russia carried out drone strikes across the region, killing three people and injuring nine others, according to Sumy's regional military administration.
On Saturday, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an ammunition depot in Crimea, the region illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.
According to Reuters, Ukraine's strike caused the detonation of warehouses where military equipment, weapons and fuel was stored."

Pupils from Scoil Mhuire formed a guard of honour outside St Mary's Oratory in Buncrana before family members arrived.
Scoil Mhuire Principal Evelyn McLoughlin had said last weekend there were no words that could fully capture the pain and sorry that everyone in the school felt and they were truly heartbroken. 
She said Emmanual Familola was known for his warm personality, gentle humour and thoughtful nature. He was highly regarded by staff and students alike.
He recently completed some work experience at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin which he thoroughly enjoyed.
A collage of photographs from his time on work experience was presented in the church as one of the offertory gifts during Requiem Mass.
His brother Daniel brought forward a Manchester City shirt as it was the team he supported. His other brother John presented a bible to reflect his deep faith.
His Principal said he was ambitious and full of potential and he never failed to show gratitude. His brother also attends the school and he is being supported by staff.
Hundreds of people made their way to St Mary's Oratory in the town to pay their respects.
They included representatives of the Taoiseach, TÃ¡naiste and the emergency services.
The family of Emmanuel, which includes his mother and two brothers, are said to be heartbroken by his tragic death.
The teenager, who was originally from Nigeria, lost his life alongside his friend Matt Sibanda, 18, who was a native of Zimbabwe.
Their respective schools, Scoil Mhuire and Crana College, said classmates were devastated at the loss of two popular friends.
They have been providing guidance and support to fellow pupils who turned out to attend the Requiem Mass.
The tragedy unfolded last Saturday afternoon after several teenagers got into difficulty at Ned's Point.
They had been playing football on the beach and had went into the water to retrieve a ball.
Emmanuel Familola was rescued and taken to Letterkenny University Hospital but died in the early hours of last Sunday morning.
Later that evening, the body of Matt Sibanda was recovered from Lough Swilly.
A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore. 
Matt attended Crana College where he had been preparing to sit his leaving certificate exam next month. 
Eighteen-year-old Matt Sibanda had been a pupil at Crana College since January 2024
School principal Kevin Cooley described his pupil as ""the most respectful young man you could ever meet"".
Both teenagers had been living with their families in separate international protection centres in Buncrana.
Last Sunday, hundreds of people attended a vigil for both teenagers at St Mary's Oratory in Buncrana which was led by the Catholic Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown.
Bishop McKeown, along with the clery in the diocese, extended their condolences to the Familola and Sibanda families."

One inmate was apprehended in New Orleans' French Quarter, police said. The other nine are considered ""armed and dangerous"", the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office said, adding that a manhunt was continuing.
Louisiana State Police identified one escapee as Kendall Myles in central New Orleans through facial recognition technology after he was filmed on a surveillance camera.
He tried to flee on foot before being apprehended hiding underneath a car in a parking garage, police said.
He was transported back to the Orleans Parish Jail, and ""is being rebooked at the facility for a new charge of Simple Escape"", it said in a statement.
The New Orleans Police Department has released the names and photographs of the other escapees in a post on X, external.
The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office initially said 11 prisoners had escaped from the facility, but the number was revised to 10 later on Friday.
Sheriff Hutson said the inmates yanked the sliding door from their jail cell off its tracks at 00:23 in the early hours of Friday morning (05:23 GMT).
They exited the jail about half an hour later after ripping a toilet from the wall and breaking metal bars around a hole in the wall that was used for piping. 
They then climbed down a wall and ran across a highway, the sheriff said. 
The sheriff's office released images of the hole in the wall, which shows what the piping fixture looked like before the toilet was ripped, external out. The photos note that ""there are clean cuts"" on the metal bars, external, which facilitated their escape. 
The photos also show messages on the wall apparently left behind by the inmates.

New Orleans police chief Anne Kirkpatrick said the prisoner escape was an ""urgent and serious situation"" and encouraged the public to report any suspicious activity.
Victims of some of the escapees have been notified, she said, adding that several are facing murder and other violent charges.
The inmates probably had help, Supt Kirkpatrick said, and are unlikely to still be wearing prison uniforms, warning that anyone who helped the inmates would be charged.

A recording obtained by political outlet Axios shows the Democrat appeared to have trouble remembering the year he left office as vice-president, or the date of his son Beau's death. 
White House aides at the time denied the president had such memory lapses. Biden was questioned by Special Counsel Robert Hur's team about why he had kept classified documents at his home and former office.
The prosecutor ultimately decided not to charge the president despite finding he had retained classified material. 
Biden gave in his first interview since leaving the White House to the BBC in May 2025
In a February 2024 report that provoked the ire of the White House and Democrats, Hur had described Biden as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"".
The audio is an excerpt from interviews on two days in October 2023. The Biden justice department previously made available the transcripts following the release of the special counsel's report in February 2024. 
It is not clear how Axios obtained the recording, but President Donald Trump's administration has been planning to release the full interview.
The Biden administration refused to release the tape last year, calling it ""constitutionally-protected law enforcement materials"" and arguing that Republicans wanted to ""manipulate"" it for ""potential political gain"". 
The Hur report's release was a difficult moment for Biden at the beginning of his re-election campaign, and highlighted one of his biggest political weaknesses - voter concerns about his age and lucidity.
The then-president hit back at the time, insisting: ""My memory is fine"". 
A new book alleges the White House covered up Biden's condition, which was said to be so poor last year that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair.

The US has lost its last perfect credit rating, as influential ratings firm Moody's expressed concern over the government's ability to pay back its debt.
In lowering the US rating from 'AAA' to 'Aa1', Moody's noted that successive US administrations had failed to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs.
A triple-A rating signifies a country's highest possible credit reliability, and indicates it is considered to be in very good financial health with a strong capacity to repay its debts. 
Moody's warned in 2023 the US triple-A rating was at risk. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US in 2023 and S&P Global Ratings did so in 2011. Moody's held a perfect credit rating for the US since 1917.
The downgrade ""reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,"" Moody's said in the statement. 
In a statement, the White House said it was ""focused on fixing Biden's mess"", while taking a swipe at Moody's.
""If Moody's had any credibility,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, ""they would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded.""
A lower credit rating means countries are more likely to default on their sovereign debt, and generally face higher borrowing costs. 
Moody's maintained that the US ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as size, resilience and dynamism and the continued role of the US dollar as the global reserve currency"". 
The firm said it expects federal debt to increase to around 134% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, up from 98% last year.
GDP is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments, and people in a country.
The BBC has reached out to the US Department of Treasury for comment. 
The downgrade came on the same day as Trump's landmark spending bill suffered a setback in Congress.
Trump's so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" failed to pass the House Budget Committee, with some Republicans voting against it.
Figures showed the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year as government spending fell and imports surged due to firms racing to get goods into the country ahead of tariffs.

Comey voluntarily participated in the questioning for about an hour at the law enforcement agency's Washington DC headquarters and was not held in custody. 
It comes a day after he posted on Instagram a photo of seashells that spelled the numbers ""8647"".
The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include ""to reject"" or ""to get rid of"", however, it has more recently been used as a term to mean ""kill"". Trump is the 47th US president.
Trump said earlier in the day during an interview with Fox News that Comey, whom he fired as FBI director in 2017, was calling for him to be killed.
What does '86' mean?
""He knew exactly what that meant,"" said Trump, who survived two attempts on his life last year. ""A child knows what that meant. 
""If you're the FBI director and you don't know what that meant, that meant assassination. And it says it loud and clear.""
""Cool shell formation,"" Comey commented before deleting the post
Trump said any decision on whether charges should be filed against Comey would be up to Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Comey posted the seashell photo on Thursday then deleted it amid conservative uproar. 
He wrote in a follow-up message on Instagram that he had seen the shells during a walk on the beach, ""which I assumed were a political message"".
""I didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took down the post.""
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X on Friday evening that the Secret Service had ""interviewed disgraced former FBI Director Comey regarding a social media post calling for the assassination of President Trump"".
""I will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection of @POTUS Trump,"" she added. ""This is an ongoing investigation.""
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the highest-ranking spymaster in the US, called earlier for Comey to be jailed for ""issuing a hit"" on Trump while he was travelling in the Middle East."

Five Republicans joined all Democrats in delivering a stunning setback to President Trump's domestic agenda, demanding deeper budget cuts.
Trump, who has muscled through close votes several times this year, urged lawmakers to unite behind the legislation. ""We don't need 'GRANDSTANDERS' in the Republican Party. STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE!,"" he posted on Truth Social.
The bill's chances of success are not hopeless, but its failure gives the Trump administration its first legislative bruise of the year.
Support for the bill among Republicans varies. Some hard-liners want to see the budget cuts go further, while other Republicans have expressed concern about cuts to programmes like Medicaid, which their constituents are dependent on. 
The five Republicans who voted against the measure in the procedural vote said they would continue to withhold support unless Speaker Mike Johnson agreed to further cut Medicaid, a healthcare programme for lower-income Americans. 
They also want Johnson to include a full repeal of green energy tax cuts, implemented by Democrats, in the bill. 
""This bill falls profoundly short,"" said Texas Republican Chip Roy, who voted against the measure.  ""It does not do what we say it does with respect to deficits.""

The proposed legislation would extend tax cuts implemented during Trump's first administration. 
While Trump touts the bill's inclusion of a no tax on tips policy, some critics argue the bill benefits wealthy Americans.
Democrats, who overwhelmingly oppose the bill, have been urging the reconsideration of Medicaid cuts and spending cuts to the Affordable care Act which offers millions of Americans subsidised health insurance. 
""No other previous bill, no other previous law, no other previous event caused so many millions of Americans to lose their healthcare. Not even the Great Depression,"" Pennsylvania Democrat Brendan Boyle said. 
If passed, the tax cuts would cost $3.72 trillion (Â£2.8t) over ten years, according to congress's bipartisan Joint Tax Committee."

Ozwald Boateng, celebrating four decades of making his indelible mark on the fashion industry, got his chance to stamp his style on the Met Gala in New York earlier this month.
The esteemed British-Ghanaian designer for the first time dressed celebrities - including three of Africa's biggest musicians, Tems, Burna Boy and Arya Starr, as well as actors Ncuti Gatwa and Jaden Smith - at what is seen as his industry's biggest night of the year.
The theme - Superfine: Tailoring Black Style - was ""completely in my wheelhouse"", he says, as it looked at the way that style formed black identities.
Given that he already has a robust legacy in the design world, the 58-year-old saw the opportunity to find fresh adherents to the Boateng look. 
""I think it's, in a way, communicating to a new audience,"" he tells the BBC a few days after the showcase.
Throughout his 40 years in fashion, the designer has built a reputation for challenging the norms of men's tailoring. His eponymous brand sells form-fitting, stylish suits, often accented with bold colours and West African-inspired patterns.
The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Boateng reimagined the country's iconic kente cloth to produce his signature ""tribal"" pattern.
""It's all about having a strong concept, having a thorough idea of what you want to achieve from the textiles,"" he says.
The Met Gala perfectly matched his outlook. ""Being a theme about black culture and black cultural influence, I mean, how can you do that without Africa?"" he asks.
Actors Ncuti Gatwa (L) and Jaden Smith (R) were both dressed by Ozwald Boateng for the Met Gala
Considering the link to Ghana, Boateng explains: ""When we were colonised by the Europeans or the Brits, we kept our traditional dress, but tailoring was a big part of how we dressed to look more... effectively more European. 
""My father always wore tailored suits. You had to be smart at all times, that was something I was taught.""
As if producing outfits for 16 celebrities for fashion's premier event was not stressful enough, Boateng switched up Burna Boy's outfit less than 24 hours before the event.
""We did his fitting quite literally the night before the Met Gala,"" Boateng says, adding that everyone in the room got ""really excited"" when they saw the Grammy-award winning musician in the finished product.
Burna Boy was pleased with his Met Gala look
The look -  a red suit paired with a buttercup yellow shirt and eel-skin cape - was partly inspired by Burna Boy's Nigerian roots. 
The musician told Vogue: ""As a waterside pikin [Pidgin for ""child""] from the Niger Delta, the eel and fish in general are the lifeblood of my people - they symbolise survival, spirit and the flow of tradition through generations.""
Afrobeats star Tems was among those who wore Boateng creations at this year's Met Gala
The Met Gala was ""not unusual"", Boateng says, explaining that Africa has been part of his ""message"" throughout his career.
Back in 1995, Boateng was the first black designer to open a shop on Savile Row, a London street famed for fine tailoring.
""When I first started as a designer, Savile as a street was a dying street,"" Boateng recalls.
""The concept, it was dying. I effectively moved there in the early 90s and breathed new life into it.""
Boateng was dubbed the ""peacock of Savile Row"" - with his flamboyance, 6ft-something frame and modelesque facial features, he stood out among his neighbours.
Colour and flair had long been part of Boateng's psyche. At five years old his favourite outfit was a purple, mohair suit made by his mother, who was a seamstress.
Young Boateng commandeered his mother's sewing machine and although he initially chose to study computing at college, he switched to fashion after realising menswear was his future.
As a teenager, Boateng was greatly inspired by tailoring titan Giorgio Armani - and decades later, Armani would praise the London designer for his ""elegance"" and ""cutting edge"" designs.
Boateng has spent the last 40 years making his mark on the British fashion industry
Boateng opened his first studio in his early 20s, dressing the likes of Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page and Spike Lee.
He then opened his Savile Row store - at the age of 28 he was the youngest to ever do so.
The burgeoning designer captivated London's fashion scene initially, but in 1998 he went bankrupt when an economic downturn in east Asia scuppered a major order. 
Both his professional and personal life descended into disarray - in just 12 months an entire collection was stolen from his studio and his marriage broke down.
But the peacock strutted his way back. Boateng gradually rebuilt his business and in 2002 moved into bigger premises on Savile Row.
Since then, he has served as Givency's creative director for menswear, been awarded an OBE, designed staff uniforms for British Airways and branched out into womenswear.
While racking up professional and charitable commitments, Boateng was raising two children.
Now adults, Oscar and Emilia Boateng accompanied their father to the Met Gala, dressed in the suits that made their surname one of the most famous in contemporary British tailoring. 
They are not, however, keen to follow their father into fashion design.
""I'm trying to slowly but surely seduce them into the fashion business,"" Boateng jokes.
""It is ultimately their decision to decide what they want from their life. If they find something they're passionate about in a way I have, I am happy.""
And what is next for his own passion? Boateng might have a brain brimming with concepts, but he has a clear vision of where he wants his brand to go next.
""The future is expansion,"" he says, ""raising capital to really, really push the brand globally"".
""I think it's the moment in time - and it's the right moment.""

Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewellery store in Tokyo can be sent to Japan following a landmark ruling.
For almost a decade, Japanese authorities have pursued the extradition of Kaine Wright, 28, Joe Chappell, 38, and a third man over allegations they posed as customers to steal items worth Â£679,000 (Â¥106m) from a Harry Winston store.
On Friday, chief magistrate Judge Goldspring rejected Wright and Chappell's challenges against extradition. Their case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan.
No extradition treaty exists between the UK and Japan, meaning it would be the first time Japan have successfully received fugitives.
Japan's initial request was rejected, but the High Court overturned the original decision following an appeal lodged by the Japanese government.
In Friday's judgement - seen by the BBC - Wright, of Plumstead, and Chappell, of Belvedere, both in London, had raised concerns over prison conditions in Japan which they argued were ""arbitrary, excessive and breach international standards"".
The Japanese government said the submissions were ""fundamentally flawed both legally and factually"".
District Judge Goldspring, chief magistrate of England and Wales, found there was a ""prima facie case"" - enough evidence to support a charge at first glance - against Chappell and that extradition would be ""compatible"" with his and Wright's human rights.
Kaine Wright appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court last month
Friday's ruling follows a recent High Court judgement that the Japanese government had a case to extradite Wright, Chappell and a third man named in papers as Daniel Kelly - who is Wright's father.
Japan's case against Kelly will be heard at the end of this month. He has not appeared in previous extradition hearings due to a conspiracy to murder case against him taking precedence.
Details from January's High Court judgement state that the Japanese ""relied upon a range of evidence"" which demonstrated that Kelly, Wright and Chappell travelled to Tokyo around the time of the jewellery raid in November 2015.
CCTV captured all three arriving at Narita International Airport on 18 November 2015 and staying at ""the Elm Share House"", Japanese authorities said.
Ch Insp Suzuki set out a record of the investigation to the High Court which indicated the trio ""took taxis"" to Harry Winston's branch in Omotesando Hills.
In their efforts to escape, the trio left a number of items behind including an Armani jacket, he said.
Ch Insp Suzuki added: ""Goggles were left at the shop and a jacket was left on the route the robbers took to flee from the scene.""
A professor at the Tokyo Dental College compared ePassport images taken at Narita Airport and compared it to CCTV stills of three men taken at the Harry Winston store.
""The possibility that two (or three) persons in the relevant comparison are the same is extremely high,"" Ch Insp Suzuki said in his report, citing the professor's ""expert"" findings.
As well as other DNA matches, Ch Insp Suzuki's report referred to ""expert evidence that glass shards found at the property where the three stayed that matched the glass in the display case at the jewellery shop"".
Findings in the reports were challenged at the High Court by lawyers representing Wright and Chappell.
The Japanese government said it would ensure that the three men would have the right to consult with a lawyer in private, have any interviews recorded and have the right not to answer any questions.
Wright, once a promising footballer on the books of West Ham United and Brentford, served time in prison after being convicted in 2023 of trying to sell a Ming vase which was stolen from a museum in Switzerland.
Subject to any further appeals, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper now has 28 days to decide whether to extradite Chappell and Wright or reject Japan's request."

Tucked away in a lane in the southern end of India's financial capital, Mumbai, is a  museum dedicated to the followers of one of the world's oldest religions, Zoroastrianism.
The Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum documents the history and legacy of the ancient Parsi community - a small ethnic group that's fast dwindling and resides largely in India.
Now estimated at just 50,000 to 60,000, the Parsis are believed to be descendants of Persians who fled religious persecution by Islamic rulers centuries ago.
Despite their significant contributions to India's economic and cultural fabric, much about the Parsi community remains little known to the mainstream population and the wider world.
""The newly-renovated museum hopes to shake off some of this obscurity by inviting people to explore the history, culture and traditions of the Parsi community through the rare historical artefacts on display,"" says Kerman Fatakia, curator of the museum.

Some of these include cuneiform bricks, terracotta pots, coins and other objects sourced from places like Babylon, Mesopotamia, Susa and Iran and are dated to 4000-5000 BCE.
These are places where Zoroastrian Iranian kings once ruled, like the Achaemenian, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties. 
There are also artefacts from Yazd, a city in central Iran which was once a barren desert and the place where many Zoroastrians settled after fleeing other regions of Iran after the Arab invasion in 7th Century BCE.
One of the notable artefacts on display is a replica of a clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great, a Persian king who was the founder of the Achaemenid empire.
Fatakia says the clay cylinder - also known as the ""Edict of Cyrus"" or the ""Cyrus Cylinder"" - is one of the most important discoveries of the ancient world. Inscribed in cuneiform script, it outlines the rights granted by Cyrus to his subjects in Babylon. Widely seen as the first human rights charter, a replica is also displayed at the United Nations.
Then there are maps that trace the migration routes of thousands of Iranian Zoroastrians who fled their home country fearing persecution and travelled to India in the 8th to10th centuries, and again in the 19th century. 
The collection also features furniture, manuscripts, paintings, and portraits of prominent Parsis - among them Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the iconic Tata Group, which owns brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea. 
Another striking section showcases artefacts collected by Parsis who grew wealthy in the early 19th century trading tea, silk, cotton - and notably, opium - with China. The exhibits include traditional Parsi sarees influenced by designs from China, France, and other regions shaped by these global trade ties. 
The museum has a replica of a fire temple, which non-Parsis are not allowed to enter

Two of the museum's most compelling exhibits are replicas of a Tower of Silence and a Parsi fire temple. 
The Tower of Silence, or dakhma, is where Parsis leave their dead to be returned to nature - neither buried nor cremated. ""The replica shows exactly what happens to the body once it's placed there,"" says Fatakia, noting that entry to actual towers is restricted to a select few.
The life-size replica of the fire temple is equally fascinating, offering a rare glimpse into a sacred space typically off-limits to non-Parsis. Modelled on a prominent Mumbai temple, it features sacred motifs inspired by ancient Persian architecture in Iran.  
The museum has cuneiform tablets and artefacts dating back centuries

The Alpaiwala Museum, originally founded in 1952 in what was then Bombay, is one of the city's older institutions. Recently renovated, it now features modern displays with well-captioned exhibits in glass cases. Every visitor is offered a guided tour.
""It's a small museum but it is packed with history,"" Fatakia says.
""And it's a great place for not just the residents of Mumbai or India to learn more about the Parsi community but for people from all over the world."""
355,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lnp3ny4wro,2025-05-16 23:13:44,"The poison paradox: How Australia's deadliest animals save lives,","With a pair of bright pink tweezers in hand, Emma Teni is delicately wrestling a large and leggy spider in a small plastic pot.
""He's posing,"" the spider-keeper jests as it rears up on its back legs. It is exactly what she's trying to achieve - that way she can suck the venom from its fangs using a small pipette.
Emma works from a tiny office known as the spider milking room. On a typical day, she milks - or extracts the venom from - 80 of these Sydney funnel-web spiders.
On three of the four walls there are floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked full of the arachnids, with a black curtain pulled across to keep them calm.
The remaining wall is actually a window. Through it, a small child stares, both fascinated and horrified, as Ms Teni works. Little do they know that the palm-sized spider she's handling could kill them in a matter of minutes.
""Sydney funnel-webs are arguably the most deadly spider in the world,"" Emma says matter-of-factly.
Australia is famously full of such deadly animals - and this room at the Australian Reptile Park plays a critical part in a government antivenom programme, which saves lives on a continent where it's often joked that everything wants to kill you.
While the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving.
So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981.
The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs.
In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices.
Spider keeper Emma Teni in her office at the Australian Reptile Park...
Where up to 80 Sydney funnel-web spiders are milked for their venom every day
There are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans.
Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after.
""I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong,"" the 26-year-old says.
""I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical.""
""This is curing my fear of spiders,"" he jokes.
As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and ""throw themselves into danger"". 
Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it.
""Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive,"" she says.
""[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, willâ¦ effectively save someone's life.""
Charlie Simpson says catching a Sydney funnel-web has helped him with his fear of the arachnids
All of the spiders her team collects get brought back to the Australian Reptile Park where they are catalogued, sorted by sex and stored.
Any females that get dropped off are considered for a breeding programme, which helps supplement the number of spiders donated by the public.
Meanwhile, the males, which are six to seven times more toxic than the females, are used for the antivenom programme and milked every two weeks, Emma explains.
The pipette she uses to remove the venom from the fangs is attached to a suction hose - crucial for collecting as much venom as possible, since each spider provides only small amounts. 
While a few drops is enough to kill, scientists need to milk 200 of these spiders to have enough to fill one vial of antivenom.
A marine biologist by training, Emma never expected to spend her days milking spiders. In fact, she started off working with seals.
But now she wouldn't have it any other way. Emma loves all things arachnid, and goes under various nicknames - spider girl, spider mama, even ""weirdo"", as her daughter calls her. 
Friends, family and neighbours rely on her for her knowledge of Australia's creepy crawlies.
""Some girls arrive home to flowers on their doorstep,"" jokes Emma. ""For me it's not unusual to arrive home to a spider in a jar.""
Spiders represent just one small part of what the Australian Reptile Park does. It's also been providing snake venom to the government since the 1950s.
According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 140,000 people die across the world from snake bites every year, and three times that many are left disabled.
In Australia though, those numbers are far lower: between one and four people each year, thanks to its successful antivenom programme.
Removing a King Brown snake from its storage locker, Billy Collett, the park's operations manager, brings it to the table in front of him. 
With his bare hands, he secures its head and puts its jaws over a shot glass covered in cling film. 
Mr Collett collects venom from a King Brown snake
""They are very uninclined to bite but once they go, you just see it pouring out of the fangs,"" Mr Collett says, as yellow venom drips to the bottom.
""That is enough to kill all of us in the room five times over - maybe more.""
Then he switches to a more reassuring tone: ""They're not looking for people to bite. We're too big for them to eat; they don't want to waste their venom on us. They just want to be left alone.""
""To get bitten by a venomous snake, you've got to really annoy it, provoke it,"" he adds, noting that bites often occur when someone is trying to kill one of the reptiles.
There's a fridge in the corner of the room where the raw venom Mr Collett is collecting is stored. It's full of vials labelled ""Death Adder"", ""Taipan"", ""Tiger Snake"" and ""Eastern Brown"". 
The last of these is the second-most venomous snake in the world, and the one that's most likely to bite you here, in Australia.
No one in Australia has been killed by a Sydney Funnel-web Spider since 1981 when the antivenom programme started
This venom gets freeze-dried and sent to CSL Seqirus, a lab in Melbourne, where it's turned into an antidote in a process that can take up to 18 months.
The first step is to produce what's known as hyper-immune plasma. In the case of snakes, controlled doses of the venom are injected into horses, because they are larger animals with a strong immune system. 
The venom of Sydney funnel-web spiders goes into rabbits, which are immune to the toxins. The animals are injected with increasing doses to build up their antibodies. In some cases, that step alone can take almost a year.
The animal's supercharged plasma is removed from the blood, and then the antibodies are isolated from the plasma before they're bottled, ready to be administered.
CSL Seqirus makes 7,000 vials a year â including snake, spider, stonefish and box jellyfish antivenoms - and they are valid for 36 months. The challenge then is to ensure everyone who needs it has supplies.
""It's an enormous undertaking,"" says Dr Jules Bayliss, who leads the antivenom medical team at CSL Seqirus.
""First and foremost we want to see them in major rural and remote areas that these creatures are likely to be in.""
Vials are distributed depending on the species in each area. Taipans, for example, are in northern parts of Australia, so there's no need for their antivenom in Tasmania. 
Antivenom is also given to the Royal Flying Doctors, who access some of the nation's most remote communities, as well as Australian navy and cargo ships for sailors at risk of sea snake bites.
Mr Collett says snakes won't waste their venom on humans, who are too big for them to eat 
Papua New Guinea also receives about 600 vials a year. The country was once connected to Australia by a land bridge, and shares many of the same snake species, so they're given the antivenom for free â snake diplomacy, if you like.
""To be honest, we probably have the most impact in Papua New Guinea, more so than Australia, because of the number of snake bites and deaths they have,"" says CSL Seqirus head of manufacturing Chris Larkins. To date, they reckon they've saved 2,000 lives.
Back at the park, Mr Collett jokes about the nickname of ""danger noodles"" that is sometimes given to his serpentine colleagues â a classic Australian trait of making light of something that gives so many visitors nightmares.
Mr Collett, though, is clear: these animals should not put people off from visiting.
""Snakes aren't just cruising down the streets attacking Brits - it doesn't work like that,"" he jokes.
""If you're going to get bitten by a snake, Australia's the best place â we've got the best antivenom. It's free. The treatment is unreal."""

""There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen."" So supposedly said the Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. The diplomatic whirlwind that has surrounded US President Donald Trump this week suggests the old Bolshevik might have been onto something.
For the protectionist president, who promises always to put America First, has in recent days instead been busy bestriding the world stage.
He and his team have done business deals in the Gulf; lifted sanctions on Syria; negotiated the release of a US citizen held by Hamas; ended military strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen; slashed American tariffs on China; ordered Ukraine to hold talks with Russia in Turkey; continued quiet negotiations with Iran over a nuclear deal; and even claimed responsibility for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan...
The pace has been breathless, leaving allies and opponents alike struggling to catch up as the US diplomatic bandwagon hurtled from issue to issue.
""Just, wow!"" remarked one London-based ambassador. ""It is almost impossible to stay on top of everything that's going on.""
So what is going on? What have we learned in this frantic week about the US president's emerging foreign policy? Is there something approaching a Trump doctrine - or is this just a coincidental confluence of global events?
A good place to start, perhaps, is the president's visit to the Gulf where he set out - in word and deed - his vision for a world of interstate relations based on trade, not war. In a speech in Riyadh, Trump said he wanted ""commerce not chaos"" in the Middle East, a region that ""exports technology not terrorism"".
His was a prospect of a breezy, pragmatic mercantilism where nations did business deals to their mutual benefit, a world where profit can bring peace.
In Saudi Arabia, Trump signed deals the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US
As he enjoyed the flattery of his Saudi hosts and the obeisance of visiting dignitaries, the president signed - with his fat felt tip pen - deals that the White House claimed represented $600bn of investment in the US.
This was Trump in all his pomp; applauded and rewarded with immediate wins he could sell back home as good for American jobs. 
Some diplomats privately questioned the value of the various memorandums of understanding. But the show, they said, was more important than the substance.
Absent from Trump's speech was any mention of possible collective action by the US and other countries; no talk of multilateral cooperation against the threat of climate change, no concerns about challenges to democratic or human rights in the region. This was a discourse almost entirely without reference to ideology or values except to dismiss their significance.
Rather, he used his speech to Saudi leaders to make his clearest argument yet against Western interventionism of the past, attacking what he called ""the so-called nation-builders and neo-cons"" for ""giving you lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs"".
To the applause of his Arab audience, he said these ""Western interventionists"" had ""wrecked more nations than they built"", adding: ""Far too many American presidents have been afflicted with the notion that it's our job to look into the souls of foreign leaders and use US policy to dispense justice for their sins. 
""I believe it's God's job to sit in judgement. My job is to defend America.""
'My job is to defend America,' Trump told audiences this week
That reluctance to intervene was on show in recent days when it came to the fighting between India and Pakistan. In the past, the US has often played a key role seeking to end military confrontations in the subcontinent. But the Trump White House was initially cautious about getting involved.
Vice-President JD Vance told Fox News the fighting was ""fundamentally none of our businessâ¦ We can't control these countries"". 
In the end, both he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did make calls, putting pressure on both nuclear powers to de-escalate. So too did other countries.
When the ceasefire was agreed, Trump claimed US diplomacy had brokered the deal. But that was flatly dismissed by Indian diplomats who insisted it was a bilateral truce.
The centrality of Trump to US foreign policy has also become apparent this week. This is more than just a simple truism. On show was the lack of involvement of other parts of the US government that traditionally help shape US decision-making overseas.
Take the president's extraordinary decision to meet Syria's new president and former jihadist, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and lift sanctions on Syria. This showed the potential advantage of having foreign policy in one man's hands: it was a decisive and bold step. And it was clearly the president's personal decision, after heavy lobbying by both Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
It was seen by some diplomats as the quid pro quo for the diplomatic fawning and investment deals Trump received in Riyadh. Not only did the decision surprise many in the region but it also surprised many in the American government.
Diplomats said the State Department was reluctant to lift sanctions, wanting to keep some leverage over the new Syrian government, fearful it was not doing enough to protect minorities and tackle foreign fighters. 
Diplomats say this pattern of impulsive decision-making without wider internal government discussion is common in the White House. The result, they say, is not always positive.

This is due, in part, to Trump's lack of consistency (or put simply, changing his mind). 
Take the decision this week to do a deal with China to cut tariffs on trade with the US. A few weeks ago Trump imposed 145% tariffs on Beijing, with blood thirsty warnings against retaliation. The Chinese retaliated, the markets plunged, American businesses warned of dire consequences.
So in Geneva, US officials climbed down and most tariffs against China were cut to 30%, supposedly in return for some increased US access to Chinese markets. This followed a now-familiar pattern: issue maximalist demands, threaten worse, negotiate, climb down and declare victory.
The problem is that this ""art of a deal"" strategy might work on easily reversible decisions such as tariffs. It is harder to apply to longer term diplomatic conundrums such as war.
Take Russia's invasion of Ukraine. On this, Trump's policy has been fluid, to put it mildly. And this week was a case in point.
Last Saturday the leaders of the UK, France, Poland and Germany visited Kyiv to put on a show of support for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. And in a group call with Trump on French President Emmanuel Macron's phone, they spelled out their strategy of demanding Russia agree an immediate 30-day ceasefire or face tougher sanctions.
This was Trump's policy too. The day before he wrote on social media: ""If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions."" But then on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin suggested instead there should be direct talks between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey on Thursday. Trump immediately went along with this, backtracking on the strategy he had agreed with European leaders a day earlier.
Some diplomats say they are confused by Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine. (Pictured with Putin in 2019)
""Ukraine should agree to (these talks) immediately,"" he wrote on social media. ""I am starting to doubt that Ukraine will make a deal with Putin.""
Then on Thursday, Trump changed his position again, saying a deal could be done only if he and Putin were to meet in person.
This puzzles some diplomats. ""Does he genuinely not know what he wants to do about the war in Ukraine?"" one remarked to me. ""Or does he just grasp at what might offer the quickest resolution possible?""
Into this puzzling mix fell two other decisions this week. First, Trump agreed a ceasefire after a campaign bombing Houthi fighters in Yemen for almost two months. There have been questions about the effectiveness of the hugely expensive air strikes, and the president's appetite for a long military operation. He repeatedly told his Arab hosts how much he disliked war.
Second, Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, held his fourth round of talks with Iran over efforts to curb their nuclear ambitions. Both sides are hinting that a deal is possible, although sceptics fear it could be quite modest. Talk of joint US-Israeli military action against Iran seems to have dissipated.
Netanyahu appears to have been snubbed by Trump this week, according to some onlookers
What unites both issues is that the United States was acting directly against the wishes of Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu may have been the first world leader invited to the Oval Office after Trump's inauguration, but in recent days, he seems to have been snubbed. Trump toured the Middle East without visiting Israel; he lifted sanctions on Syria without Israel's support. His Houthi ceasefire came only days after the group attacked Tel Aviv airport.
Diplomats fear Netanyahu's reaction. Could the spurned prime minister respond with a more aggressive military operation in Gaza?
So after this week of diplomatic hurly burly, how much has changed? Perhaps less than might appear.
For all the glitz of Trump's tour through the Middle East, the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues unresolved. A fresh Israeli offensive seems imminent. One of Trump's chief aims â the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia - remains distant.
For all the talks about ending the war in Ukraine, there is no greater likelihood of the guns falling silent. Putin's ambitions seem unchanged. And for all the deals to cut US tariffs, either with the UK or China, there is still huge global market instability.
Despite deals to cut US tariffs, there is still huge global market instability
We do have a clearer idea of Trump's global ideology, one that is not isolationist but mercantilist, hoping optimistically that capitalism can overcome conflict. We also have a clearer idea of his haste, his desire to clear his diplomatic decks â in the Middle East, Ukraine and the subcontinent â so he can focus on his primary concern, namely China.
But that may prove an elusive ambition.â¯If there are weeks when decades happen, there are also weeks when nothing happens.

Mexico is seeking compensation from the producers of a MrBeast video and has accused the US YouTuber of exploiting its ancient pyramids for commercial gain.
The video ""I Explored 2000 Year Old Ancient Temples"" shows the influencer, real name Jimmy Donaldson, 27, and his team exploring ancient Mayan cities, with a permit.
But in one part of the video produced by Full Circle Media, which has received more than 60 million views in a  week, MrBeast advertises a  chocolate product as a ""Mayan dessert"" and urges viewers to buy it.
Authorities said that while they had granted permission to film at the sites, they had not permitted for-profit use. A MrBeast representative denied some of the accusations.
The spokesperson told the BBC: ""No advertisement material was shot on any archaeological sites overseen by INAH (National Institute of Anthropology and History)."" 
In the video, the scene promoting the chocolate snack appears to be filmed at the influencer's camping site.
The spokesperson also said the video was ""meant to highlight these treasured Mayan sites in Mexico"" and that it was ""unfortunate that this has turned into a political issue - hopefully it can lead to a productive dialogue and encourages people to visit these unique historical treasures"".
Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum on Wednesday called for an investigation into the conditions under which the filming permit had been granted.
In the video's caption, MrBeast thanks Mexican tourism and government authorities for permission to film in the sites, while also plugging links to his chocolate product.
The video shows him and his team exploring areas of restricted access in the Mayan cities of Calakmul and ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡. At one point he says ""I can't believe the government's letting us do this.""
They are also shown appearing to descend into a pyramid from a helicopter and in another scene are shown handling an ancient pre-Hispanic mask.
But heritage authorities said these were ""false assertions"" and accused the YouTuber of presenting misinformation. INAH said MrBeast had never held a real pre-Hispanic mask and there appeared to have been extensive post-production editing in the video - such as the helicopter scene.
""All of these are false assertions that obey the theatricality of the YouTuber in question,"" its statement on Monday read. 
Mexico's Secretary of Culture Claudia Curiel de Icaza said on Thursday that, although they had authorised the permit for MrBeast to film, they had never authorised the publication of false information or the use of heritage site images for trademark advertising.
""We disapprove of any commercial pursuit that distorts the value of archaeological sites, which are a legacy of our indigenous cultures and the pride of our nation,"" she said. 
She added that, although Mexico was open to content that contributes to the ""knowledge and dissemination of Mexico's archaeological and cultural heritage"" it was firmly against those who ""take advantage of the willingness of institutions"".
She said INAH would consider ""administrative sanctions"" against Full Circle Media, who was issued the permit to film. The BBC has sought comment from the firm.
MrBeast, dubbed the King of YouTube, is the most-subscribed to person on the platform, with 395 million followers. His Mayan pyramids video was published on 10 May."

When Andry HernÃ¡ndez got a pair of tattoos on his wrists with the words mom and dad, he thought they would look even more striking if he added something else to them, according to the tattoo artist, JosÃ© Manuel Mora.
""What if you add some small crowns?"" Mr HernÃ¡ndez is said to have asked the artist.
The crown is the symbol of the Catholic annual Three Kings Day celebrations for which Mr HernÃ¡ndez's Venezuelan hometown, Capacho Nuevo, is famed.
Seven years later, those crowns may have led to Mr HernÃ¡ndez - who describes himself as a gay barber - being locked up in El Salvador's mega-prison. He and dozens of other Venezuelans alleged by US President Donald Trump to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang were deported to the Central American nation in March.
""If I had known that the crowns would take Andry to jail, I would never have tattooed them on his body"", Mr Mora tells BBC Mundo.
The administration insists it did its due diligence and had sufficient intelligence before deporting any alleged gang members. 
Mr HernÃ¡ndez left his hometown in Venezuela for the United States in May last year. Like many migrants, he began a long trip through the DariÃ©n jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, on his journey to Mexico.
According to court documents filed by his lawyers, obtained by BBC Mundo, the 31-year-old surrendered at the border, at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, on 29 August after making an appointment with the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency for asylum.
His asylum request claimed that he was a victim of persecution in Venezuela for his political beliefs and sexual orientation.
What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?
BBC Verify: British man's tattoo wrongly linked to Venezuelan gang in US government document
Mr HernÃ¡ndez has two crowns tattooed on his wrists along with the words ""mom"" and ""dad"" written in English
He was then taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and was sent to the Otay Mesa Detention Centre in San Diego.
At the centre, ""he was flagged as a security risk for the sole reason of his tattoos"", his lawyer wrote in a statement.
His legal team says Mr HernÃ¡ndez's interrogation at the centre was carried out by an official from the private company CoreCivic - a company contracted by the government - not by Ice agents.
CoreCivic official Arturo Torres, acting as interviewer, used a score system to determine whether a detainee is part of a criminal organisation.
It has nine categories, each with its own score. According to the criteria, the detainees are considered gang members if they score 10 or more points, and they are considered suspects if they score nine or fewer points.
Mr HernÃ¡ndez was given five points for the tattoos on his wrists, which included two crowns, according to paperwork signed in December 2024 by officers from the company.
The interviewing officer wrote: ""Detainee HernÃ¡ndez has a crown on each one of his wrist. The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member"".
The BBC has contacted CoreCivic for comment, but has not received a reply.
""So far, that form is the only government document linking Mr HernÃ¡ndez to the Tren de Aragua,"" Lindsay Toczylowski, executive director of the Immigrant Defenders Law Centre and part of the legal team representing the young Venezuelan, told BBC Mundo.
Authorities have not provided further information about Mr HernÃ¡ndez's case, or the charges faced by him or other Venezuelans recently deported to El Salvador.
Lawyers defending migrants' cases do not know whether the particular score system that marked Mr HernÃ¡ndez as a suspected member of Tren de Aragua has been used during the assessment of other detainees. However, authorities have acknowledged that tattoos are one of the criteria used for identifying gang members.
According to court documents filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of Venezuelan deportees, there is second scoring guide which evaluates detainees on a 20-point  scale.
The form instructs agents on how to validate detainees as a member of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act - a centuries-old law that has been invoked by Trump to detain and deport individuals considered enemies of the United States.
Higher scores of 10 points are given to detainees who have criminal or civil convictions, sentencing memorandums, or criminal complaints that identify them as members of Tren de Aragua.
Lower scores are for those with tattoos denoting their membership or loyalty to the gang (four points) - or who have insignias, logos, notes, drawings, or clothing indicating loyalty to it (also four points).
The lowest scores (two points) are assigned if the detainee, for instance, appears on social media displaying symbols or hand gestures related to the gang.
BBC Mundo reached out to DHS and Ice to request information about the scoring system used in the two forms, but received no response.
However, DHS has previously published a statement on its website, called 100 Days of Fighting Fake News, stating that its assessments go well beyond tattoos and social media.
""We are confident in our law enforcement's intelligence, and we aren't going to share intelligence reports"", the document said. ""We have a stringent law enforcement assessment in place that abides by due process under the US Constitution.""
What is the 1798 law that Trump used to deport migrants?
More than 200 Venezuelan migrants were deported to El Salvador's mega-prison on 15 March
Jason Stevens, special agent in charge of the El Paso Homeland Security Investigations Office, told BBC Mundo that according to the guidelines, officers used a variety of criteria to identify a gang member.
He said in addition to an individual's tattoos, officers look at criminal associations, monikers, social media activity and messages on phones.
Lawyers representing deportees have included official government guidelines in their court cases, arguing that it is insufficient to identify a detainee as a member of Tren de Aragua based on photographs of tattoos.
Venezuelan researcher and journalist Ronna RÃ­squez, author of a book about Tren de Aragua, dismisses the idea that tattoos are a criterion that defines membership in this group.
""Equating the Tren de Aragua gang with Central American gangs in terms of tattoos is a mistake,"" she warned. ""You don't have to have a tattoo to be a member of the Tren de Aragua gang.""
Unaware that he was suspected of belonging to Tren de Aragua, Mr HernÃ¡ndez was expecting to appear in a US court for another asylum-related hearing that he hoped could eventually allow him to remain in the country.
By March 2025, he had spent nearly six months at the San Diego detention centre before being abruptly transferred to the Webb County Detention Centre in Laredo, Texas, while his asylum case was still pending.
He was not the only person who would be transferred to that second centre.
On 15 March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected Tren de Aragua members, arguing that Venezuelan authorities had ceded control over their territories to transnational criminal organisations.
Without being able to contest the charges, Mr HernÃ¡ndez was deported that day as part of a group of 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans, to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison, known as the Terrorist Confinement Centre (Cecot).
Mr HernÃ¡ndez had a court date scheduled for his asylum request, but according to his lawyers, authorities at the Webb County Detention Centre would not allow him to attend via video call.
Since then, no-one has heard from him. His parents had no information about him until they were told that someone had seen a photo of their son in a Salvadoran prison.

Mr HernÃ¡ndez designed and hand-embroidered his own costumes for the annual religious festival known as the Three Wise Men of Capacho, his family says.
He also designed the outfits for some of the local girls participating in the festival in his home state of TÃ¡chira, near the border with Colombia.
The symbol that identifies the religious festival - which was officially declared part of Venezuela's national cultural heritage, and of which its residents are proud - is a golden crown.
Since he was seven years old, Mr HernÃ¡ndez has participated in the festival representing various biblical characters.
""Andry is a makeup artist, a theatre actor, and we all love him very much"", said Miguel ChacÃ³n, president of the Capacho Three Kings Foundation, which organises the 108-year-old event. 
""Some young people get tattoos of the kings' crowns like Andry did. That was his crime.""
Hundreds of people in Capacho Nuevo, a modest agricultural town, participated in a vigil at the end of March to demand Mr HernÃ¡ndez's release. Some of them wore crowns.
One of Mr HernÃ¡ndez's friends, Reina CÃ¡rdenas, maintained contact with him until a few days before his deportation. She showed BBC Mundo official documents indicating that the young man had no criminal record in Venezuela.
Mr HernÃ¡ndez has participated in the Capacho Three Wise Men festival for over 20 years; its symbol is a crown
Mr HernÃ¡ndez dreamed of opening a beauty salon and helping his parents financially, Ms CÃ¡rdenas said by phone from Capacho Nuevo.
Seeking a better future, Mr HernÃ¡ndez left his hometown and lived in BogotÃ¡ for a year, where he worked as a makeup artist and as a hotel receptionist.
He returned to Venezuela after receiving a job offer at a television channel in Caracas, where he was excited by the idea of doing makeup for presenters, models, and beauty queens, Ms CÃ¡rdenas said.
""He did not stay in the TV station for more than a year because he was discriminated against for his sexual orientation and because of his political beliefs,"" she noted. ""He received threats.""
Mr HernÃ¡ndez decided to leave Caracas and return to his hometown. ""He wasn't well, he didn't want to leave his house,"" his friend said. He remained there for five months until May 2024, when he decided to travel to the US through the DariÃ©n jungle, despite his mother urging him to stay.
Members of Mr HernÃ¡ndez's family - joined by costumed attendees of a vigil - have called for his release
Today, Mr HernÃ¡ndez's mother, Alexis Romero de HernÃ¡ndez, can hardly bear the pain of not having him by her side. 
""I'm waiting for news of my son,"" she told BBC Mundo. ""I want to know how he is. I wonder how they're treating him. If they gave him water. If they gave him food. Every day I think about him and ask God to bring him back to me.""
The last known image of Hernandez is a photo taken of him on the night of 15 March inside the Salvadoran mega-prison, when a American photojournalist Philip Holsinger documented the arrival of a group of alleged criminals for Time magazine.
That was when he took a photo of a young man saying ""I'm not a gang member. I'm gay. I'm a barber"", Mr Holsinger wrote in his article.
The man was chained and on his knees while the guards shaved his head. Mr Holsinger later learned that man was Mr HernÃ¡ndez.
""He was being slapped every time he would speak upâ¦ he started praying and calling out, literally crying for his mother,"" Holsinger told CBS. ""Then he buried his face in his chained hands and cried as he was slapped again.""
Mr HernÃ¡ndez's case has caused a stir in the US, and mystery surrounds his whereabouts. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested his return, while four US congressional representatives travelled to El Salvador and requested to be provided with proof of life for him. They did not get it."

Trump is the 47th American president, and the phrase ""to 86"" is a commonly-used restaurant industry term in American-English, meaning ""to remove or eject"". It is thought to have existed since the 1930s. 
More recently, the term has taken on another lesser-known meaning - ""to kill"", according to Merriam-Webster, the oldest publisher of dictionaries in the US. 
Comey deleted his post, and says he was unaware of the violent interpretation. Trump has disputed that, alleging that Comey was calling for his assassination ""loud and clear"".
Ex-FBI boss Comey investigated over seashell photo
The shifting explanations of Comey's 2017 FBI dismissal
The term's etymology is not certain, according to Merriam-Webster, but it is widely believed to have originated from soda counter servers in the early 20th Century who would say it to mean that an item had sold out.
The most common theory is that the term is rhythming slang for ""nix"" - meaning ""to refuse or reject"" - although countless other ideas have been proposed. 
The term later came to be used as a verb. For example, restaurant workers might tell each other to remove something from the menu by ""86ing"" it. 
By the 1950s, it was being used to refer to customers too. Unruly or drunk customers might be thrown out or refused more drinks if they've been ""86'ed"" by staff.
In military or law enforcement jargon, it has also come to mean to eliminate or kill, according to a blog entry by Merriam-Webster, external. 
However, the dictionary does not include that meaning in its entry for 86, explaining that this omission is ""due to its relative recency and sparseness of use"".
There are countless other suggestions of how the ""86"" phrase originated - some of which hint at violence. One legend suggests the phrase began at a Prohibition-era bar in New York where unruly patrons were evicted through the door at 86 Barrow Street. 
But as St Louis magazine, external pointed out in 2019, there are at least 86 theories for where the term came from.
The phrase ""86"" is thought to have been used by soda servers in the early 20th Century
The US Secret Service and the FBI say they are investigating the post by Comey, who Trump famously fired in 2017.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the highest-ranking spymaster in the US, called for Comey to be jailed for ""issuing a hit"" on Trump while he was travelling in the Middle East. 
Supporters of the former FBI director say his post is probably protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution - which ensures freedom of speech. 
For that reason, Comey's post ""neither constitutes a true threat nor merits federal investigation"", according to a statement by campaign group the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).
It has also been pointed out by Democrats that 8646 was also frequently used by critics of former Joe Biden, who was the 46th president. 
On Amazon, items can be found for sale with imagery displaying both the numbers 8646 and 8647. Also for sale are 8645 items - which could refer to Trump's first term in the White House, when he was the 45th American president."

Sweden's foreign minister has spoken of grief among her colleagues after it emerged that a diplomat who was questioned this week on suspicion of spying has been found dead.
The man, described as a high-ranking diplomat, was arrested by Sweden's SÃ¤po intelligence service on Sunday and released on Wednesday. He had denied wrongdoing, although prosecutors said he remained under suspicion.
Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard released a statement saying her thoughts were with the diplomat's family, friends and colleagues and said it had been a difficult day.
She said she could not go into further details about the case. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.
Former foreign minister Carl Bildt described the ""tragically deceased ambassador"" as extremely gifted and competent, who had worked in various roles within the foreign ministry.
Swedish reports said he had spent long periods stationed outside Europe, most recently as an ambassador. Asked to confirm whether the man who died was an ambassador, his lawyer Anton Strand said he had no comment. 
Images of the door to the diplomat's flat on Swedish TV showed that it had been forced open at the time of his arrest.
The diplomat had sought medical treatment for injuries and submitted a report alleging use of excessive force at the time. SÃ¤po said the arrest had been peaceful.
Mr Strand said in a statement to the BBC: ""I have ensured his formal report about abuse during the arrest has arrived to the special investigations unit. An investigation has started regarding this.""
Unconfirmed reports from public broadcaster SVT suggest SÃ¤po had been investigating a possible link to the sudden resignation of the new national security adviser, Tobias Thyberg, who quit hours a day after taking on the role.
Hours before he resigned, sensitive pictures of him on the dating app Grindr had been sent anonymously to the government.
Sweden's national security adviser quits over Grindr images
Mr Strand made no comment on that but said he had received the news of his client's death early on Friday and his thoughts were with his family.
Prosecutor Per Lindqvist told Swedish TV that the death was very regrettable and a preliminary investigation into suspected espionage was not complete.
Swedish reports said the man was in his 50s and had returned to his home in central Stockholm temporarily after a long period abroad."

""Melania"" appeared on the banks of the River Sava in July 2020, four months before her human inspiration left the White House.
Now, four months after the erstwhile Melanija Knavs resumed residence at Washington's most famous address, her larger-than-life-size avatar has apparently made an undignified exit from her Slovenian hometown, Sevnica.
All that remains of the massive bronze statue are the feet â and the two-metre-tall tree stump they were standing on.
Melania Trump sculpture in Slovenia set on fire on US Independence Day
New Melania Trump metal statue unveiled in Slovenia
The symmetry would probably appeal to the whimsical US director Wes Anderson â who often features bizarre heists in his films. But even in his back catalogue, there has never been anything quite like the case of the cursed First Lady statue.
Because this is not the first time a Melania Trump tribute has met a sticky end in Sevnica.
The first iteration was unveiled in July 2019. Carved from a single piece of wood by a chainsaw-wielding local artisan called Ales ""Maxi"" Zupevc, it lasted a year before an unidentified perpetrator decided to turn it into a Fourth of July bonfire.
Luckily, US artist Brad Downey â who commissioned Maxi to create the wooden original â had already made a cast of the statue. It duly made a comeback in bronze, at the same site.
At its unveiling, Mr Downey said the new version had been designed to be ""as solid as possible, out of a durable material which cannot be wantonly destroyed"".
But, as it turns out, it can be chopped off at the ankles and taken away.
Local police say they are treating ""Melania's"" disappearance as ""theft"" and have launched an investigation.
The first iteration of the statue by local artist Ales ""Maxi"" Zupevc was set on fire
Brad Downey has always insisted that his work was political. He chose Maxi as a collaborator because his upbringing had been similar to that of the First Lady.
And he argued that Melania Trump benefitted from a fast-tracked US citizenship process, while other immigrants suffered under her husband's ""xenophobic"" policies.
Now he suspects the statue's disappearance ""has something to do with Trump getting re-elected"".
Meanwhile, in Sevnica, the local authorities have mixed feelings. They condemned ""any form of interference with private or public property"".
But, they added, ""the image of the US First Lady was not something anyone was proud of""."

As crowds gathered at a food distribution point in northern Gaza, six-year-old Ismail Abu Odeh fought his way to the front.
""Give me some,"" he called out.
His bowl was filled with lentils, but as he made his way back, it was knocked out of his hands. He returned to his family's tent crying.
An uncle who had managed to get some food later shared some with Ismail.
The following day, no deliveries of water or food arrived at the displacement camp where he lives, located in a school in Gaza City, and the people gathered there were left with empty bottles and bowls. Ismail cried again.
The BBC has spent the past two days speaking to people across Gaza, as Israel ramps up its military action and continues a more than 10-week total blockade on food, medical supplies and other aid. 
There are mounting warnings from the United Nations and others that the enclave is on the brink of famine.
Ismail cried after no food or water was delivered to the camp where he lives
The Israeli government insists there is ""no shortage"" of food in Gaza and that the ""real crisis is Hamas looting and selling aid"". 
Government ministers have described the stoppage of aid as a ""main pressure lever"" to secure victory over Hamas and get all the hostages out. There are still 58 hostages in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
Israel does not allow international journalists free access to Gaza, so our communication has been over phone calls and WhatsApp messages, and through trusted Palestinian freelancers who live in the territory.
Those who spoke to the BBC described their struggle to find even one meal a day, with food kitchens shutting down because of the shortages and few items in the markets. Items that are still available are at highly inflated prices that they cannot afford, they said.
A man running one of the remaining food kitchens in Gaza said he was operating ""day by day"" to find food and oil. Another man we spoke to said the kitchen he volunteered at had closed 10 days ago when supplies ran out, describing it as a ""disastrous feeling"".
One 23-year-old woman living in north Gaza said ""dizziness has become a constant feeling"" as well as ""general weakness and fatigue from the lack of food and medicine"".
Adham al-Batrawi, 31, who used to live in the affluent city of al-Zahra but is now displaced in central Gaza, said hunger was ""one of the most difficult parts of daily life"".
He said people had to get ""creative just to survive"", describing through WhatsApp messages how he would over-cook pasta and knead it into a dough before cooking it over a fire to create an imitation of bread - a staple in the Palestinian diet.
""We've invented ways to cook and eat that we never imagined we'd need,"" he said.
He added that the one meal a day he had been eating recently was ""just enough to get us through the day, but it's far from enough to meet our energy needs"".
Half of Adham al-Batrawi's family home in al-Zahra was destroyed, he told the BBC
Elsewhere in central Gaza, in the city of Deir al-Balah, nurse Rewaa Mohsen said it was a struggle to provide for her two young daughters, aged three and 19 months.
She said she had stockpiled nappies during the ceasefire earlier this year but that these would run out in a month.
Speaking over WhatsApp on Thursday, she said her daughters had grown used to the sounds of bombing that would ring through the apartment. ""Sometimes I feel more afraid than them,"" she wrote, adding that she would distract her children with colouring books and toys.
The next day, over voice note she said evacuation orders had been issued for her area before an Israeli strike hit a nearby building.
When she returned to her home to ""clean the mess"",  she found that the doors and windows had been blown off.
""Thank God that I am still alive with my girls,"" she said.
When asked if she would stay in the apartment, she responded: ""Where else will I go?""
Across Gaza, medics described the impact of the blockade on medical supplies and said they no longer felt safe at work following Israeli strikes targeting hospitals.
Nurse Randa Saied said she was working at the European Hospital in Khan Younis when it was hit in an Israeli strike this week, describing it as a moment of ""pure terror and helplessness"".
Israel has long accused Hamas of using hospitals as covert bases and for weapons storage, which the group denies.
The European Hospital is no longer operating, but Randa said staff and patients had moved to the nearby Nasser Hospital.

Staff at Nasser and other hospitals in Gaza told the BBC the blockade meant they were running short on basic supplies like painkillers and gauze, and had to shut down some services.
The US has confirmed that a new system for providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza through private companies is being prepared, with Israeli forces set to secure the centres' perimeters. The United Nations has criticised the plan, saying it appears to ""weaponise"" aid.

Gabon's former President, Ali Bongo, who was deposed in a 2023 coup, has left the country and is now in Angola, the authorities there have announced.
The Angolan presidency added in a statement posted on social media , externalthat Bongo's family had been released from detention and were with him in Luanda.
The Bongo family lawyer, FranÃ§ois Zimeray, welcomed the release of his clients and denounced their ""arbitrary and cruel imprisonment"".
Bongo's wife and son, Sylvia and Noureddin, face corruption charges and had been detained since 2023. 
They have not yet publicly commented on the charges, however Mr Zimeray described his clients as being ""subjected to torture"" while being held in what was described as underground cells.
""Sylvia and Noureddin Bongo will now finally be able to turn the page, heal and rebuild their lives,"" Mr Zimeray said.
The BBC has contacted Gabon's presidency for comment on the release and subsequent departure of the Bongo family to Angola.
The authorities have previously denied subjecting the Sylvia Bongo and her son to cruel treatment. 
Gabonese prosecutor Eddy Minang says the release of Mrs Bongo and her son is merely provisional, owing to poor health and that legal proceedings against the two will continue.

Brice Oligui Nguema: The coup leader who stormed to election victory
The family's release comes after Angolan President JoÃ£o LourenÃ§o, who currently heads the African Union, visited Libreville and held talks with his Gabonese counterpart Brice Oligui Nguema - the former general who led the coup against Bongo before being winning a landslide in last month's presidential elections.
Ali Bongo, whose father Omar ruled Gabon for more than four decades, was in power for 14 years until the 2023 coup.
After his toppling he was placed under house arrest where he reportedly remained, although Gabonese authorities say he was free to move about as he wished. 
His wife and son were detained in prison and then released earlier this week following a request by the Bongo family lawyer, according to Mr Minang. 
Reacting to their release, opposition leader Alain Claude Bilie-by-Nze said current President Oligui Nguema had bowed ""to international demands after what everyone understood to be an abuse of power"".
Sylvia and Noureddin Bongo both stand accused of embezzling public funds, with Mrs Bongo specifically facing charges of forgery, money laundering and falsifying documents. 
During their 14 years in power, the Bongo family had been accused of accumulating wealth for themselves at the expense of the country - allegations they deny.
Despite Gabon being an oil-rich nation, a third of its population lives below the poverty line, according to the UN. 
In a sign of warming relations between Gabon and its continental counterparts, the African Union readmitted the country to its bloc late last month after its membership had been suspended due to the coup. 
In a statement the body's chairman, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, said that he hoped ""Gabon's example will inspire similar pathways toward constitutional restoration across the continent"".

More than three years into Europe's deadliest war since 1945, there was a small step forward for diplomacy on Friday.
Delegations from Ukraine and Russia came face-to-face for talks for the first time since March 2022 â one month after Moscow's full-scale invasion of its neighbour. The setting was an Ottoman- era palace on the shores of the Bosphorus in Istanbul. 
Pressure and encouragement from Turkey and the US helped get the warring parties there.
There were no handshakes, and half the Ukrainian delegation wore camouflage military fatigues â a reminder that their nation is under attack. 
The room was decked with Ukrainian, Turkish and Russian flags â two of each â and a large flower arrangement â a world away from the shattered cities and swollen graveyards of Ukraine.
'President Trump is driven by the need to achieve for peace in Ukraine' - Sebastian Gorka
Turkey's Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, told the delegations there were two paths ahead â one road leading to peace, and the other leading to more death and destruction.
The talks lasted less than two hours and sharp divisions soon emerged. The Kremlin made ""new and unacceptable demands"", according to a Ukrainian official. That included insisting Kyiv withdraw its troops from large parts of its own territory, he said, in exchange for a ceasefire.
While there was no breakthrough on the crucial issue of a truce â as expected - there is news of one tangible result.
Each side will return 1,000 prisoners of war to the other. 
""This was the very good end to a very difficult day,"" said Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Serhiy Kyslytsya, and ""potentially excellent news for 1,000 Ukrainian families.""
The swap will take place soon, said Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, who led his country's delegation. ""We know the date,"" he said, ""we're not announcing it just yet.""
He said  ""the next step"" should be a meeting between Zelensky and Putin.
That request was ""noted"" according to the head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky â a presidential aide.
He said the Russian delegation was satisfied with the talks, and ready to continue contacts. 
That was a change from Thursday when Russia's Foreign Ministry called President Zelensky ""a clown and a loser.""
But there are fears â among Ukraine and some of its allies â that Russia is engaging in diplomacy simply to buy time, to distract from international pressure for a ceasefire, and to try to stave off the 18th round of European sanctions. The EU says they are already in the works.
And while the two sides have now sat around the table, President Trump has said the only talks that count will be those between him and President Putin.
He announced on Thursday, mid-flight on Air Force One, that ""nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together.""
It's unclear when that meeting will be. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says top-level talks are ""certainly needed,"" but preparing a summit will take time.
Whenever those talks happen, President Zelensky is unlikely to be invited."

The funeral of an Irish police officer knocked down and killed in County Dublin last weekend has been told he was ""adored"" by everyone in his family and that the loss they are experiencing is ""heart breaking"".
Kevin Flatley, 49, died at the scene after he was hit by a motorcyclist in Lanestown, in the north of the county, shortly before 13:00 local time on Sunday.
He had been carrying out a speed checkpoint.
At his funeral in Balbriggan, Dublin, Garda Flatley's coffin was draped with the Irish tricolour and his hat and gloves placed upon it.
Garda motorcycle colleagues from the Dublin Metropolitan Region's roads policing unit formed a guard of honour as the hearse carrying Garda Flatley's coffin arrived at St Peter and Paul's Church.

Two police officers led the cortege, one carrying the Irish tricolour and the other the flag of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police force).
A number of items including a fiddle, a GAA top and jersey, and a family bible which he used to read to his children, were placed at the altar to commemorate his life.
Among those who attended the funeral were Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin, President Michael D Higgins, TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Harris, Minister for Justice Jim O'Callaghan, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and First Minister Michelle O'Neill.

A colleague, Garda Rosanna Caul, spoke of the ""privilege"" of working with the ""family man"".
She said that on Sunday, the lives of Garda Flatley's wife Una, and their daughters, were changed forever.
""They never imagined when Kevin went to work, that he would not return home,"" she said.
""The family are so grateful to those who came to Kevin's aid on Sunday and to everyone who has taken care of Kevin since this time.""

""Kevin's memory will never be forgotten, he is forever in his children's, family's and friends' hearts, and Kevin will always be cherished by everyone who knew him.""
Kevin Flatley had more than 26 years of service with An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na
Garda Kevin Flatley, who was a member of the roads policing unit based at Dublin Castle, is the 90th member of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na to be killed on duty.
The 89 other garda victims lost their lives on duty for a variety of reasons including incidents relating to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, while on anti-crime operations, and in accidents.
Following the fatal collision on Saturday, Garda Commissioner (head of the Irish police force) Drew Harris called for ""a real reset"" when it comes to road safety.
Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Mr Harris said it was a ""desperately sad day for An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na"".
Following the funeral mass, Garda Flatley's remains were taken for a private family burial in Newcastle, County Dublin."

Chad's former prime minister and opposition leader, SuccÃ¨s Masra, has been arrested over alleged links to a clash which took place on Wednesday in the south west of the country, a public prosecutor has said.
He is suspected of spreading hateful messages on social media linked to the violence in which at least 42 people died, Oumar Mahamat Kedelaye said.
Masra's Transformers party said he had been ""kidnapped"" by military officers in the early hours of the morning"" and denounced his detention, which it says was ""carried out outside of any known judicial procedure"".
Masra is a fierce critic of President Mahamat DÃ©by and claimed to have defeated him in elections last year.
Masra said his victory had been stolen ""from the people"" although the official results said DÃ©by had won with 61% of the vote. 
Wednesday's clash broke out in the village of Mandakao, in Logone Occidental province near the Cameroonian border.
""Messages were circulated, notably on social networks, calling on the population to arm themselves against other citizens,"" Mr Kedelaye said. 
It is not entirely clear what caused the violence, but one source told the AFP news agency that it is believed it was triggered by a land dispute between farmers from the Ngambaye community and Fulani herdsmen. 
There has been a troubling recent pattern of violence between local farmers and herders, with the farmers accusing the latter of grazing animals on their land.
More than 80 others have also been detained in connection with the clashes.
Masra briefly served as interim prime minister of the transitional government between January and May 2024. 
His party boycotted legislative polls last December due to concerns over the transparency of the electoral process.
The DÃ©by family has ruled Chad for more than three decades.
The military installed DÃ©by as Chad's leader after his father, Idriss DÃ©by Itno, was killed by rebels in 2021.

Nearly 100 people, including children, have been killed in a large-scale Israeli ground, air and sea attack launched early Friday in north Gaza, the Hamas-run civil defence and residents have said. 
The civil defence said at least nine homes and tents housing civilians had been bombed overnight and it had received dozens of calls from people trapped.
Witnesses also reported smoke bombs, artillery shelling and tanks in Beit Lahia.
Israel's military said it was ""operating to locate and dismantle terrorist infrastructure sites"" in north Gaza and had ""eliminated several terrorists"" over the past day.
This marks the largest ground assault on north Gaza since Israel resumed its offensive in March.
Basheer al-Ghandour, who fled Beit Lahia for Jabalia after the attack, told the BBC people were sleeping when suddenly ""intense bombing"" hit overnight.
""It came from all sides - air strikes and warships. My brother's house collapsed. There were 25 people inside,"" he said.
He said 11 people were injured and five killed, including his nieces, aged five and 18, and a 15-year-old nephew. He and others tried to free relatives from the rubble.
""My brother's wife is still under the rubble - we didn't manage to rescue her. Because of how intense the bombing was, we had to flee,"" he said.
""We didn't take anything with us - no furniture, no food, no flour. We even left in bare feet.""
Another survivor, Yousif Salem, told reporters he and his three children had ""just escaped death"".
""An air strike hit our neighbours' home - none of them survived,"" he said.
He said artillery shells began hitting near their house as they were trapped inside. When he tried to leave, a quadcopter drone opened fire, he said. 
He made a second attempt under heavy shelling, he said. All roads were blocked, but they managed to find a side road.
""We escaped only minutes before Israeli tanks encircled the area,"" he said.
According to local residents, the attack began with smoke bomb barrages followed by intense artillery shelling from nearby Israeli positions.
Tanks then began advancing toward Al-Salateen neighbourhood in western Beit Lahia.
Witnesses reported that Israeli armoured vehicles surrounded a school sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians.
Israeli aircraft dropped leaflets early Friday over several areas in north Gaza calling on residents to evacuate the areas immediately, raising fears the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was expanding its military operation in one of Gaza's most densely populated regions.
The evacuation orders sparked panic among families who have been displaced multiple times since the war began. Many have nowhere else to go.
""I swear I don't know where we're going,"" said Sana Marouf, who was fleeing with her family on a donkey cart in Gaza City. 
""We don't have mattresses, blankets, food or water.""
She said she had seen people ""torn to pieces"" overnight. ""It was a black night. They were relentlessly bombing us.""
Palestinians make their way with belongings as they fled their homes, after Israeli air strikes, in the northern Gaza Strip on 16 May
The attack in north Gaza comes after Israeli air strikes killed more than 120 people, mostly in the south, on Thursday.
The IDF said on Friday it had struck more than 150 ""terror targets"" throughout Gaza over the past day, including anti-tank missile posts, military structures, and centres where groups were planning to ""carry out terrorist attacks against IDF troops"".
In south Gaza, the IDF said it had dismantled Hamas structures and shafts and killed ""several terrorists"" who Israel said had planned to plant an explosive device.
While Friday's powerful overnight strikes and reported advance by ground troops west of Beit Lahia are significant, this does not yet look like Israel's threatened major military offensive.
Israel's government has pledged to intensify operations in Gaza and indefinitely reoccupy the Strip if Hamas did not accept a proposal for a temporary ceasefire and the return of remaining hostages by the end of President Donald Trump's regional trip, which concluded on Friday.
While there has been no sign of a breakthrough with negotiating teams still in Doha, local media say that Arab mediators have been pushing for more time to give talks a chance.
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas agreed in January broke down when Israel relaunched air strikes on Gaza in March.
Israel also implemented a total blockade on humanitarian aid, including food, that has been widely condemned by the UN as well as European and Arab countries.
Israel's defence minister Israel Katz last month said the blockade was a ""main pressure lever"" to secure victory over Hamas and get all the hostages out. 
There is growing evidence that Israel's 10-week blockade is having an increasingly detrimental humanitarian impact. Aid organisations and residents say people in Gaza are now starving. 
A recent UN-backed report said Gaza's whole population â some 2.1 million people â is at critical risk of famine.
The Israeli government has insisted there is no shortage of food in Gaza and that the ""real crisis is Hamas looting and selling aid"".
Palestinians struggle to get their food rations outside a crowded distribution centre in Beit Lahia on 15 May
Israel and the US have proposed allowing in and distributing aid through private companies - a plan rejected by the UN.
The deteriorating situation in Gaza has drawn concern from the US this week.
Boarding his flight home from the Middle East, Trump said the US needs to ""help out the Palestinians"" and acknowledges ""a lot of people are starving"".
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration was ""troubled"" by the humanitarian situation.
Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Fifty-eight hostages are still being held in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.

When Poles vote for a new president on Sunday, they are expected to set up a second round run-off between Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and national-conservative historian Karol Nawrocki.
If opinion polls are correct, that would mean a 1 June contest between candidates backed by the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for the past two decades, a domination some voters say they're fed up with.
Trzaskowski, the current front-runner, is deputy leader of prime minister Donald Tusk's centre-right Civic Platform (PO).
Nawrocki, currently polling between 4%-6% behind, is supported by the Law and Justice (PiS) opposition party that lost power 18 months ago.
Poland's president has the power to veto government bills, so what happens in this election is significant.
Tusk's coalition does not have a big enough parliamentary majority to overturn that veto, which outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a former PiS member and ally, has used on several occasions.
That barrier may now fall as Duda cannot run again after serving two consecutive five-year terms.
Observers outside Poland portrayed Tusk's election as prime minister in late 2023 as saving liberal democracy after eight years of right-wing authoritarian populism by the PiS-led government.
Critics widely accused PiS of turning public media into crude propaganda for its conservative Catholic worldview, politicising the civil service and judiciary and punishing judges who dared to oppose the reform.
But Tusk's coalition government has also used questionable legal methods to wrestle back control of the public media.
Tusk has suspended the right for migrants arriving on the border with Belarus to apply for asylum and failed to deliver many of his campaign promises such as liberalising the country's strict abortion law.
""This is not the triumph of liberal values. It's a choice between a stupid and authoritarian right-wing populism and a hypocritical, and in my eyes, morally corrupt liberal populism,"" Konstanty Gebert, a columnist for Kultura Liberalna told the BBC.
The presidential election could be won in Sunday's first round with more than 50% of the vote, but latest opinion polls suggest it will be decided on 1 June.
Miroslaw Kaznowski, a member of the Green party that belongs to Tusk's broader Civic Coalition, will vote for Trzaskowski, despite some reservations.
He told the BBC: ""I am disappointed the coalition government is pandering to the right-wing electorate instead of standing up for its values.""
In one of the presidential debates, the PiS-backed candidate Nawrocki, proudly brandishing a mini Polish flag, tried to embarrass Trzaskowski by handing him a small rainbow flag.
In the past, the Warsaw mayor has been a vocal supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and attended equality marches in the capital.
Trzaskowski took the flag and put it on the floor, causing left-wing candidate Magdalena Biejat to walk over, saying ""I'm not ashamed of it, I'll gladly take it from you"".
Kaznowski said: ""Migration, LGBT+, women's rights and the environment have fallen off the agenda, but we're still at the risk of falling back to an authoritarian government that aspires to Eastern values.""
Donald Tusk has been unable to deliver on many of the reforms he promised before he became prime minister
Tusk promised Polish women legal abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy, but he has not delivered on his promise.
He presides over a broad coalition built around his own centre-right grouping that also includes smaller left-wing and conservative parties.
Disagreements within the coalition over abortion and legalising same sex partnerships stalled even before President Duda had the chance to veto them.
Following Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine, state security has dominated political discourse.
Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said ""outflanking"" PiS on security, including a tough migration policy, was key to winning the 2023 election.
Hours before campaigning came to an end on Friday, Tusk accused a group of Russian hackers of attacking websites belonging to parties in the government. Tusk's Civic Platform site was unavailable along with that of a smaller agrarian conservative partner, the Polish People's Party.
This year, Poland is planning to spend 4.7% of its GDP on defence, a larger proportion than any other Nato member.
Tusk wants to offer all adult males the chance to do military training. Trzaskowski was photographed going through basic drills during the campaign.
Karol Nawrocki has so far been largely undamaged by claims surrounding his purchase of a flat from a pensioner in bad health
The liberal mayor's tough messages on security and migration led PiS to accuse him of saying anything to win votes.
It's a view shared by civil servant Wojciech Karlik, who plans to vote for the PiS-backed candidate, Nawrocki.
""Nawrocki will fight for Poland's interests in the EU. He's reliable unlike Trzaskowski who keeps changing his mind on issues like migration,"" he said.
Nawrocki has come under fire recently over accusations, which he denies, that he bought a council flat from a senior citizen in poor health at a 90% discount to the market price in return for promises of assistance and care.
By his team's own admission, Nawrocki was surprised when he lost contact with the pensioner last December. Local media reported the man had been living in a nursing home paid for by taxpayers for six months by that stage.
Following an uproar, Nawrocki said he would donate the flat to charity. Opinion polls suggest the accusations have not damaged Nawrocki's chances so far.
But the numbers indicate none of the 13 candidates will win sufficient votes to avoid a run-off between the two front-runners.
PiS, led by 75-year-old Jaroslaw Kaczynski, and Tusk's PO are the two parties that have dominated Polish politics for the last 20 years and some voters are fed up with the duopoly.
In March, 38-year-old far-right libertarian candidate and brewing entrepreneur Slawomir Mentzen, who attracted voters, especially young men, with his anti-migrant and tax-cutting talks during his ""Beer with Mentzen"" meetings in small towns and cities, appeared close to overtaking Nawrocki into second place.
But his support has dropped since he gave an interview calling for the introduction of student tuition fees and a ban on abortion even in cases of rape.
Aleksandra Januszewicz, a psychotherapist, told the BBC: ""I'm fed up with the stranglehold of PO and PiS. The politics I'm seeing is mostly a form of populism that plays to voters' emotions.
""I'm not decided yet [on who to vote for], but I'm going to throw up afterwards.""
Human rights lawyer Malgorzata Szuleka agrees there is fatigue, both with the duopoly and Tusk government's failure to deliver.
""Polish politics looks a little bit like going to McDonalds,"" she told the BBC. ""You go in hoping for something else and you leave with a burger and fries.
""My hope is for a president that can freeze the polarisation in the country, and we can start talking to each other again."""

Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted of attempted murder and assault earlier this year.
Sir Salman was on stage speaking before an audience in August 2022, when he was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck. The attack left him blind in one eye, with damage to his liver and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.
The attack came 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses, which had long made him the target of death threats for its portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.
Matar received the maximum 25-year sentence for the attempted murder of Sir Salman.
He was also found guilty of assault for wounding the person who was interviewing Sir Salman, Henry Reese, and sentenced to seven years plus three years post-release for that assault. 
The sentences must run concurrently because both victims were injured in the same event, Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said on Friday.
Before being sentenced, Matar stood and made a statement about freedom of speech in which he called Rushdie a hypocrite, according to the Associated Press.
""Salman Rushdie wants to disrespect other people,"" said Matar, clad in white-striped jail clothing and wearing handcuffs. ""He wants to be a bully, he wants to bully other people. I don't agree with that.""
Sir Salman was not in the court for his assailant's sentencing on Friday.
Sir Salman Rushdie on the stabbing attack
Matar was convicted of attempted murder and assault in February, 2025, following an intense trial during which Sir Salman detailed the moment when he felt certain that he was going to die. 
During the two-week trial, he testified that he saw a man rushing towards him while on stage at the historic arts institute in Chautauqua, New York.
He said his assailant's eyes ""were dark and seemed very ferocious"".
Sir Salman told the court he initially did not realise he had been stabbed, thinking instead that he had been punched.
Matar stabbed Sir Salman 15 times in total including to his cheek, chest, eye, neck and thigh.
Prosecutors argued that the attack was targeted.
""There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,"" prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt then told the jury.
Defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan had argued that prosecutors failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman.
Matar, who pleaded not guilty, did not testify in his defence. His lawyers did not call any witnesses of their own.
""I don't think he's a very good person,"" Matar said about the author in a 2022 New York Post story. ""He's someone who attacked Islam.""
Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution.
The attack took place some 35 years after Sir Salman's controversial novel The Satanic Verses was published.
The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous.
Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book.
But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished.
Just before the attack Sir Salman told a German magazine he felt his life was ""relatively normal"".
The British-Indian novelist later detailed his experience and long road to recovery in a memoir called Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder."

The department store chain, which has applied for creditor protection, will sell its intellectual property for C$30m ($21.5m, Â£16.2m).
The move comes after the company, also known as HBC, liquidated all its stores, citing a shifting retail landscape post-pandemic and US tariffs as insurmountable challenges. 
Canadian Tire is another major domestic retailer, with over 1,700 shops across the country that sell everything from sporting goods to hardware. 
Why shoppers are spending thousands on these blankets
At stake is a brand that is over 350 years old. Founded in 1670, HBC was granted a royal charter to control trade in parts of Canada. The company began trading British-made wool ""point"" blankets emblazoned with stripes in blue, red, green and yellow.
It then morphed into a mid- and upper-range department store with key properties in several historic downtown buildings in cities across the country. 
It also began branding a plethora of products with those same point-blanket stripes, from teddy bears to ceramics.
When it announced it would be closing down, demand for Hudson's striped products soared, with blankets especially selling for thousands on eBay. The resurgence of interest in the company, while it was on its last breath, sparked some hope that the brand may be able to make a comeback. 
The sale of its intellectual property - which includes in-house brands like Gluckstein and Distinctly Home - to Canadian Tire will ensure that the brand lives on, even if the physical shops do not."

Prosecutors said he arrived in Ukraine in February 2024, alleging he was paid between 600,000 and 800,000 rubles (Â£5,504 and Â£7,339) a month to take part in military operations against Russian troops.
A video surfaced in December last year showing Mr Jenkins with his hands tied, being hit in the face and questioned by Russian forces. They ask him if he is being paid to fight in Ukraine.
In January, Australia summoned the Russian ambassador over false reports that Mr Jenkins had been killed following his capture. 
Since then, the Australian government has repeatedly called for his release.
""We'll continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin on behalf of Mr Jenkins,"" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told 9News in April.
In March, a British man James Scott Rhys Anderson was jailed for 19 years by a Russian military court after being charged with terrorism and mercenary activity, becoming the first British national convicted by Russia during the war. 
The 22-year-old was captured last November in Russia's Kursk region - where Ukrainian forces began a surprise incursion last August before retreating in recent months. 
Just before launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent of Ukraine. Russian proxy forces began an insurgency there in 2014."

Bella Culley, 18, from Billingham on Teesside, who is being held in prison number 5 in Rustavi, faces a five-day wait to find out whether she can see her father.
She has been told she will be detained for 55 days before trial while the prosecution investigates where the 12kg (26lbs) of marijuana and 2kg (4.4lbs) of hashish found in a travel bag had come from, and whether she was planning on handing it over to someone else.
Her lawyer, Ia Todua, said that she has the ""right to demand this short-term visit from her family"".
Ms Todua, who has been appointed by the state to represent the British teenager, said Ms Culley should be allowed short visits, and that the authorities legally have to respond to her request within five days.
""She has the right to demand this short-term visit from her family, through the decision of the prosecution,"" said Ms Todua.
""She's not cut off from outside contact. She is allowed small meetings."" 
The BBC was told that the meeting could be up to an hour long, that a lawyer does not have to accompany the family, and that there will be no glass partition between the two parties.

Comey posted on Instagram a photo of seashells that spelled the numbers ""8647"", which he captioned: ""Cool shell formation on my beach walk."" 
The number 86 is a slang term whose definitions include ""to reject"" or ""to get rid of"", according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, which also notes that it has more recently been used as a term meaning ""to kill"". And Trump is the 47th US president.
Comey insisted he did not know what the numbers meant, but Trump has disputed that.
James Comey had a tumultuous tenure as FBI director, and has clashed with Donald Trump. 
Comey deleted the Instagram post, saying in a follow-up that he ""assumed [the sea shells] were a political message"". 
""I didn't realise some folks associate those numbers with violence,"" he added. ""It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down.""
But Trump argued that ""a child knows what that meant"". 
""That meant assassination, and it says it loud and clear,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview, clips of which were released before broadcast on Friday. ""Now, he wasn't very competent, but he was competent enough to know what that meant.""
In a post in X, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said: ""We vigorously investigate anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees. 
""We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI Director & we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters.""
""Cool shell formation,"" Comey commented before deleting the post
Trump survived two assassination attempts last year.
Current FBI Director Kash Patel responded on social media, saying that the bureau was ""aware of the recent social media post by former FBI Director James Comey, directed at President Trump"". 
""We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS [Secret Service] on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support.""
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on X: ""Disgraced former FBI Director James Comey just called for the assassination of Trump.""
She said her department and the Secret Service would investigate the matter. 
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino posted on X, accusing Comey of ""a plea to bad actors/terrorists to assassinate the POTUS' while traveling internationally"", referring to Trump's current tour of the Middle East. 
The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, also responded on X, commenting: ""James Comey causally [sic] calling for my dad to be murdered.""
Comey served as the FBI's director between 2013-17.
He had a tumultuous tenure that included overseeing the high-profile inquiry into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's email just weeks before the 2016 election that she ended up losing to Trump.
He was fired by Trump amid an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election."

A North Ayrshire Council bin has swapped Saltcoats for sauerkraut - after being unexpectedly found in a German village.
The wheelie bin was spotted in the village of Viernau by an intrigued local, who took to social media to ask if anyone had any idea how it had arrived there.
North Ayrshire Council told BBC Scotland News it was uncertain how the container had managed to wind up abroad, but the continental jaunt could be linked to its manufacturer, the German company SSI Schaffer.
Comments in the Dull Men's Club Facebook group suggested it had perhaps fallen foul of safety regulations in the UK, and then been reused in Germany instead. 
Christian KÃ¼hne posted the image, and wrote: ""A wheelie bin from the North Ayrshire Council appears in front of my company. In the middle of Germany.
""I'm confused and curious what might be the story behind it. Is someone in the North Ayrshire Region missing his wheelie bin?""
Commentors also pointed out it was a combination of a brown bin - meaning it should be used for garden waste - with a blue bin lid, which should be for paper and recycling. 
A spokesperson for North Ayrshire Council confirmed to BBC Scotland News that Viernau - in the state of Thuringia in the eastern part of Germany - had not been added to the local authority's usual bin collection routes.
They said:  ""This German street is definitely not part of our regular collection route so we're very curious as to how it ended up here.
""We can say that this bin was manufactured more than 20 years ago by a German company, SSI Schaffer, so it may have been a spare from the manufacturer which found its way into local use.
""As bins are the property of residents, it's also possible that it could have been taken to Germany by a former resident moving to the area and may have been used to store items in the move.""
The spokesperson said the council would be interested to find out how it arrived. 
Social media suggestions ranged from realistic possibilities about it being reused by the manufacturers to pondering whether an unfortunate person in Ayrshire was currently wondering where their bin had gone."

Ethiopia's main opposition party has condemned a ban on its activities, saying it posed a ""serious threat"" to the 2022 peace deal that ended two years of conflict in the northern Tigray region.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has called for the African Union to mediate with the federal government after the electoral agency revoked its legal status as a party.
The party, which governs Tigray and dominated the entire country for many years, was on Wednesday banned for failing to hold a general assembly.
The decision follows months of political tensions in Tigray and comes ahead of nationwide elections that are due to take place by June next year at the latest.
The party led a coalition that overthrew the government in 1991 and ruled Ethiopia until 2019 when it was dissolved a year after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had taken power. 
He then formed a new national party, a move rejected by the TPLF.
The dispute culminated in a civil war that saw tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes in northern Ethiopia before a truce was signed in November 2022.
'No-one can handle another war' - Tigrayans fear fresh Ethiopian conflict
The party runs Tigray's interim administration which was established in 2023 as part of the peace deal, known as the Pretoria peace agreement. 
But the party has been unable to conduct internal elections because of a split, with two factions laying claim to control of the party.
The National Election Board of Ethiopia, which supervises the conduct of political parties, on Wednesday ""resolved to formally deregister"" the  TPLF on the grounds that it had failed to hold a general assembly.
But the party has protested against the move and called on the African Union to put ""pressure"" on the federal government to suspend the enforcement of the ban.
In a letter to the AU, the party said the ban ""denies the TPLF a right it had reclaimed through the Pretoria Agreement and poses a serious threat to the foundation of the peace process"".
It added that the peace deal stipulated that both parties recognise each other's legitimacy and any political issue should be resolved through dialogue.
TPLF deputy chairman Ammanuel Assefa told the BBC that the decision by the electoral board could ""damage the Pretoria agreement"" which ""is going to be dangerous"". 
""This isn't just about TPLF, but also about undermining what people have sacrificed,"" Ammanuel added. 
Delays in implementing the terms of the agreement, including the return of some one million people displaced by the war, have fuelled fears of fresh violence in Tigray. 
Several countries including the US, UK and the European Union have warned about the escalating tension, saying there must be ""no return to violence"".

An ultra-swimmer who is preparing to swim 1,000 miles (1,609km) around Iceland said he was inspired by actor Chris Hemsworth and his role as the Nordic god Thor.
Ross Edgley, 39, from Alderley Edge in Cheshire, joked the three-month challenge will be ""the closest thing yet to swimming around Asgard"" - the home of Thor.
He said he was introduced to Australian Hemsworth during the production of Thor: Love And Thunder (2022), describing the Hollywood star ""just full of questions"" and an ""encyclopaedia"" of Nordic folklore.
Mr Edgley will embark on his journey, deemed the Great Icelandic Swim, on Friday, and expects to face choppy waters, killer whales and temperatures as low as 3C.
Hemsworth has reprised the role of Thor in a number of Marvel films: 'His knowledge of Nordic folklore is amazing,"" says Edgley.
The swimmer's intended routine will see him swim for six hours and rest for six hours, a pattern which will be repeated every day for about three months.
Mr Edgley is no stranger to difficult challenges, having previously swum more than 1,791 miles (2882km) in 157 days around the coast of Great Britain, as well as earning a Guinness World Record for the longest-distance assisted adventure swim, covering 317 miles (510km) along the Yukon River in Canada.
But he said the Iceland challenge is likely to be ""twice as hard"" because of the colder temperatures.
""Usually in England, when you get out of a frozen lake, you're running somewhere where there's a hot chocolate and you can get around the fire - but out there it's just Viking country,"" he said.
Ross Edgley holds a Guinness World Record for his swim along the Yukon River in Canada
The ultra-swim is also being completed in the name of science, with Mr Edgley planning to take daily water samples, working in collaboration with the University of Iceland and the Marine and Freshwater Research Institute of Iceland.
The samples are designed to help build a picture about the biodiversity around Iceland's coast, researching the environmental DNA (eDNA) in the water.

A 1,000 year-old human skeleton which was buried sitting cross-legged in India has been moved to a museum six years after it was excavated.
The BBC had reported earlier this month that the skeleton had been left inside an unprotected tarpaulin shelter close to the excavation site in western Gujarat state since 2019 because of bureaucratic wrangling.
On Thursday, the skeleton was shifted to a local museum, just a few miles away from where it was unearthed.
Authorities say that it will be placed on display for the public after administrative procedures are completed.
The skeleton being transported from the shed to the museum
Mahendra Surela, curator of the Archaeological Experiential Museum in Vadnagar where the skeleton has now been shifted, told the BBC that the skeleton was transported with ""utmost care"" and under the supervision of several experts.
He added that officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the agency responsible for preservation of archaeological research - will examine the skeleton before taking a decision on where and how the skeleton should be displayed in the museum. 
It is currently placed next to the reception and is fenced in by a protective barrier.
""It is likely that we may shift it to the second floor, where a photograph of the skeleton is already placed,"" Mr Surela said.
Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar, who discovered the skeleton, said that he was happy that the significant find was getting the attention it deserved.
Ambekar had earlier told the BBC that the skeleton was a rare discovery as similar remains had been found at only three other sites in India.
Officials stand next to the skeleton in the museum
But as officials argued over who should take charge of the skeleton, it remained in a make-shift tent close to the excavation site, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements.
Experts say that the skeleton likely belongs to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE.
The skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that aided preservation.
Mr Ambekar said that the remains could shed light on the phenomenon of ""samadhi burials"" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried rather than cremated."

What began as public calls to boycott travel to Turkey has now escalated into a broader rupture, with India severing links with Turkish businesses and universities.
The diplomatic chill stems from Turkey's recent vocal support for Pakistan during the recent India-Pakistan hostilities.
On Thursday India barred Turkish firm Celebi from operating at its airports, citing national security concerns - an allegation the company denies. 
Several Indian universities - including Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia, and Maulana Azad National Urdu University- have also suspended academic ties with Turkish institutions.
Celebi, which handled ground services at major airports like Delhi and Mumbai, has been formally dropped, in line with the federal aviation ministry orders.
India's minister of state for aviation has said in a post on X, external that in recent days the government had received requests from across the country to ban the company.
""Recognising the seriousness of the issue and the call to protect national interests, we have taken cognisance of these requests. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has revoked the security clearance of the said company,"" the minister stated.
According to a Bloomberg report, external, Celebi has said it will pursue all ""administrative and legal"" remedies to ""clarify"" the allegations and seek a reversal of the order. The company also called the revocation of its security clearance ""unjust"".
""Our company and subsidiaries bear no responsibility for any potential disruptions, delays or negative impacts on airport operations and civil aviation traffic in India,"" Bloomberg quoted the company as saying.
Deadly fighting broke out between India and Pakistan last week after Delhi launched airstrikes on its neighbour, saying it was in response to the deadly Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has denied any involvement in the incident.
Turkey and Azerbaijan were quick to back Pakistan after India's military action - Ankara warned of ""all-out war"", while Baku condemned Delhi's strikes.
The fallout sparked a wave of backlash, with boycott calls against Turkey - and Azerbaijan - gaining traction on social media and being echoed by senior political leaders. The boycott gained momentum after reports emerged of Turkish drones being used by Pakistan against India.  
In recent years, a high number of Indians have chosen Turkey and Azerbaijan as their travel destinations
Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a former federal minister and a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said, external: ""Every hardworking Indian who travels abroad as a tourist understands today that their hard-earned rupee should not be spent on those who help the enemies of our country.""
The social media boycott calls had an immediate impact, with Indian travel sites reporting a sharp spike in cancellations this week.
""Indian travellers have expressed strong sentiments over the past week, with bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkey decreasing by 60%, while cancellations have surged by 250%,"" said a spokesperson for travel website MakeMyTrip.
Most travel sites still allow bookings, but some are discouraging travel, with promotions and flight discounts to Turkey and Azerbaijan quietly pulled.
Rohit Khattar, who runs a travel agency in Delhi, said he's already seeing clear hesitation among clients about visiting Turkey. 
""Many young travellers may avoid it, fearing backlash on social media or social retribution,"" he said, adding that his firm won't risk investing in trips that might not take off.
According to official data, 330,100 Indians visited Turkey in 2024, up from 274,000 in 2023. Azerbaijan also saw a rise, with nearly 244,000 Indian arrivals last year.
Despite rising numbers, Indians made up for less than 1% of Turkey's foreign visitors in 2024 - a modest share with limited impact on overall tourism revenue. In contrast, they accounted for nearly 9% of foreign arrivals in Azerbaijan.
After the pandemic, Turkey and Azerbaijan grew popular among Indian travellers for their affordability, proximity, and Europe-like experiences at lower costs. Budget airlines have boosted access with direct flights in recent years.
Some social media users are promoting alternatives like Greece, but travel sites report no major spike in interest. 
Travel website Cleartrip told the BBC, ""As this is a developing situation, we haven't seen significant  highs or lows in demand for these alternate destinations"".

There are now more North Korean defectors working in the South's public sector than ever before, Seoul has said.
By the end of 2024,  211 North Korean defectors held jobs in the public sector, 17 more than the previous year, the Ministry of Unification said in a statement on Wednesday.
That number is the highest since 2010, when North Korean defectors ""began to enter the public service in earnest"", the ministry said.
Seoul has been widening its support for North Korean defectors who struggle with unemployment and social isolation as they adjust to their new lives in the South.
""There is a growing need to expand opportunities for North Korean defectors to enter public service so that they can directly participate in and contribute to the government's policymaking,"" the ministry said.
Authorities in Seoul have in recent years intensified social integration programmes. It has also offered financial support and tax incentives for companies who hire North Korean defectors.
At an event on Wednesday, Unification Minister Kim Yung-ho shared a meal with North Korean defectors in public service roles.
There are about 30,000 North Korean defectors residing in South Korea. But defections have waned since the pandemic, which saw countries shut their borders. Before 2020, more than 1,000 North Koreans fled to the South every year.
North Korean defectors are denounced by the regime, and rights groups say that those caught escaping to the South are punished with imprisonment and torture.
Last July, former North Korean diplomat Tae Yong-ho was named the new leader of South Korea's presidential advisory council on unification - the first defector to be given such a high rank in South Korea's government.
In 2020, Tae became the first defector to be elected to South Korea's National Assembly.
Pyongyang had called him ""human scum"" and accused him of crimes including embezzlement.
The defectors offer a rare look into the highly secretive regime under leader Kim Jong Un. They have told stories of human rights abuses under the regime, including widespread starvation, forced labour and state-enforced disappearances.
But many of them face serious challenges as they settle into their new lives: difficulties finding and holding down jobs, social stigma and mental health issues stemming from traumatic experiences in the North."

The Poindexter Descendants Association is made up of people descended from the Poindexter, Poingdestre, Pendexter and Puddester lines.
It holds annual reunions in the US and tours to Jersey every few years. They are an assorted bunch, but ancestry is their common thread - and the group's research shows George has nearly 10,000 descendants in the US alone.
This year's tour of Jersey was the largest yet, with visitors from 10 US states, Canada, Switzerland and London.
Jamie Poindexter organised the 2025 Poindexter tour to Jersey
Jamie Poindexter, who is from Wisconsin and organised this year's tour, said she considered the island her ""second home"" after making her first trip in 1998.
""I feel very comfortable and very welcome and the people are very friendly,"" she said.
Speaking about the association, she said it was formed ""by a miracle"".
""A few Poindexters that had been doing genealogy back in the 1980s found each other somehow and decided to have a get together,"" she said.
Within about two years the first members had created a non-profit organisation and the association grew from there, she said.
They said they discovered they were all related to Jersey-born George Poingdestre and found he had close to 10,000 descendants just in the US.
Jimmy Poindexter (right) said coming to Jersey with his family was on his bucket list
Jamie Poindexter said George was thought to have changed his name to the Latin version, Poindexter, to make it more professional when he did business.
As the association continued its research, they also found Pendexters who had come from New England and Puddesters from Newfoundland in Canada, she said.
Jimmy Poindexter travelled to Jersey from Virginia with 15 other immediate family members, including his wife and four children.
He said the trip was a bucket list trip for his family and it was his first time visiting the island.
During the trip, the group went on a walking tour of the town centre to learn about its history.
Mr Poindexter said it was nice to see things older than what he was used to.
""We don't get to see buildings that are this old in the US,"" he said.

Francis Puddester travelled to Jersey from St John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.

The World Health Organisation has declared a polio outbreak in Papua New Guinea and called for an ""immediate"" vaccination campaign.
Samples of the highly infectious virus were found in two healthy children during a routine screening in Lae, a coastal city in the country's north east.
Less than half of the country's population are immunised against the potentially deadly disease, which is close to being wiped out but has recently resurfaced in some parts of the world.
""We have to do something about it and we have to do it immediately,"" said Sevil Huseynova, WHO's representative in Papua New Guinea, warning that the disease could spread beyond the country.
""We have to make maximum effort to get 100% [vaccination] coverage,"" Dr Huseynova said at a media conference on Thursday. 
""Polio knows no borders."" 
The disease is caused by the poliovirus, which spreads through contact with an infected person's faeces or droplets when they cough and sneeze. 
It mostly affects children under five years old. 
There is no cure for polio, although the majority of people with the infection - including the two recent cases in Papua New Guinea - have no symptoms. Those who do may get a flu-like illness. 
A small number of people infected with polio - between one in a thousand and one in a hundred - develop more serious problems that can lead to paralysis. This is also when the disease becomes life-threatening, particularly when paralysis affects muscles used for breathing.
Papua New Guinea was said to be polio-free since 2000, until an outbreak in 2018, which was contained within the same year. 
The latest cases were found to be carrying a virus strain genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia. Papua New Guinea shares a border with Indonesia's easternmost Papua province. 
Health Minister Elias Kapavore has vowed to achieve 100% polio immunisation in the country by the end of this year. 
""There is no excuse... Polio is a serious disease,"" he said. 
The ongoing campaign will target children aged 10 and below and is expected to reach around 3.5 million people. 
""The battle on polio starts today,"" the department wrote in a Facebook post yesterday.
The WHO, UN's children agency Unicef and Australia's government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its rollout of vaccines. 
Unicef's Papua New Guinea representative Veera Mendonca pointed out the disparity in vaccination coverage across the country - with coverage as low as 8% in some districts.  
""That is not acceptable,"" she said, adding that Unicef is working with churches and community leaders to encourage vaccination and to dispel any misinformation.
Polio has staged a comeback elsewhere in Asia in recent years. Pakistan saw 74 cases of the disease last year, while Afghanistan recorded 24 cases.
The WHO has also warned of an outbreak in war-torn Gaza after traces of the virus were found in wastewater."

La Poderosa, which owns the mine where the murders took place, previously said 39 people with links to the company have been killed by criminal gangs in Pataz in total.
This most recent attack prompted Peru's President Dina Boluarte to impose a night-time curfew in Pataz and to suspend mining activities for a month. Extra police and soldiers were also sent to the region."

Australia's most-decorated living soldier Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost an appeal against a landmark defamation judgement which found he committed war crimes.
A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging the Victoria Cross recipient had murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Mr Roberts-Smith had argued the judge made legal errors.
The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces.
A panel of three Federal Court judges on Friday unanimously upheld the original judgement, though Mr Roberts-Smith has said he will appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia ""immediately"".
""I continue to maintain my innocence and deny these egregious spiteful allegations,"" he said in a statement.
Mr Roberts-Smith, who left the defence force in 2013,  has not been charged over any of the claims in a criminal court, where there is a higher burden of proof.
The former special forces corporal sued three Australian newspapers over a series of articles alleging serious misconduct while he was deployed in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012 as part of a US-led military coalition.
At the time the articles were published in 2018, Mr Roberts-Smith was considered a national hero, having been awarded Australia's highest military honour for single-handedly overpowering Taliban fighters attacking his Special Air Service (SAS) platoon.
The 46-year-old argued the alleged killings occurred legally during combat or did not happen at all, claiming the papers ruined his life with their reports.
His defamation case - which some have dubbed ""the trial of the century"" in Australia - lasted over 120 days and is now rumoured to have cost up to A$35m ($22.5m; Â£16.9m).
In June 2023 Federal Court Justice Antony Besanko threw out the case against The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Canberra Times, ruling it was ""substantially true"" that Mr Roberts-Smith had murdered unarmed Afghan prisoners and civilians and bullied fellow soldiers.
He also found that Mr Roberts-Smith lied to cover up his misconduct and threatened witnesses.
Additional allegations that he had punched his lover, threatened a peer, and committed two other murders were not proven to the ""balance of probabilities"" standard required in civil cases.
The ""heart"" of the appeal case was that Justice Besanko didn't given enough weight to Mr Roberts-Smith's presumption of innocence, his barrister Bret Walker, SC said.
There is a legal principle requiring judges to proceed carefully when dealing with civil cases that involve serious allegations and in making findings which carry grave consequences.
Mr Walker argued that meant the evidence presented by the newspapers fell short of the standard required.
Months after the appeal case had closed, Mr Roberts-Smith's legal team earlier this year sought to reopen it, alleging misconduct by one of the reporters at the centre of the case.
They argued there was a miscarriage of justice because Nick McKenzie, one of the journalists who wrote the articles at the centre of the case, allegedly unlawfully obtained details about Mr Roberts-Smith's legal strategy.
The legal team pointed to a leaked phone call between Mr McKenzie and a witness - which The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Canberra Times said may have been recorded illegally.
But on Friday, the trio of judges rejected that argument too.
They said ""the evidence was sufficiently cogent to support the findings that the appellant murdered four Afghan men"".
""To the extent that we have discerned error in the reasons of the primary judge, the errors were inconsequential,"" they added.
They also ordered Mr Roberts-Smith to pay the newspapers' legal costs.
In a statement, Mr McKenzie called the ruling an ""emphatic win"".
He thanked the SAS soldiers who ""fought for the Australian public to learn the truth"", and paid tribute to the Afghan ""victims of [Mr] Roberts-Smith"".
""It should not be left to journalists and brave soldiers to stand up to a war criminal,"" he said. ""Australian authorities must hold Ben Roberts-Smith accountable before our criminal justice system."""

The top US diplomat Marco Rubio has said the US is ""troubled"" by the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
His comments came as at least 114 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, health officials said.
Asked by the BBC if the Trump administration remained fully behind the nature of Israel's military action given the scale of the recent Israeli attacks and its bombing of hospitals, he once again called on Hamas to surrender and release hostages and said there could be no peace so long as the group exists.
""That said, we're not immune or in any way insensitive to the suffering of the people of Gaza, and I know that there's opportunities here to provide aid for them,"" he said.
Gaza has been under a complete Israeli blockade of all food and other humanitarian supplies for 10 weeks. Israeli forces have been intensifying their bombardment of what they say are Hamas fighters and infrastructure ahead of a planned expansion of their ground offensive in Gaza.
Rubio's comments - made after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Turkey - appeared to be a reference to a controversial Israeli-American proposal to use private providers to set up aid collection points in Gaza. That plan has been rejected by the UN as unethical and unworkable.
They come as Donald Trump is visiting the region and indirect negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Hamas and Israel continue.
Hamas meanwhile accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of ""undermin[ing] mediation efforts by deliberate military escalation"".
An Israeli government spokesman said Israel wanted negotiations on hostage releases to succeed, but that they would take place while Hamas was under ""military pressure"".
The US is Israel's main arms supplier and the language used by Rubio is unusual. Previously he has responded to questions about Palestinian civilian casualties only by calling on Hamas to surrender. It also comes amid recent reports of a rift between Trump and Netanyahu.

Israel issues major evacuation order for Palestinians sheltering in Gaza City

In southern Gaza the streets of Khan Younis were filled with funeral processions and grieving families on Thursday morning, following what residents said were the deadliest set of air strikes in the city since Israel resumed its offensive almost two months ago.
Some 56 people, including women and children, were killed when homes and tents sheltering displaced families were bombed overnight in the city, the local Nasser hospital said. 
The Israeli military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in southern Gaza.
One man told BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme that Nasser hospital's mortuary was ""filled beyond capacity"", and that several bodies had to be placed in the corridor before they could be buried.
Doctors were forced to treat wounded people, including those with burns, amputations and internal bleeding, on stretchers, benches and on the floor due to a lack of beds, he said.
""Among those killed today were 36 children... Entire families have been wiped from the civil registry,"" he added. ""Tragically, this level of destruction has become part of daily life.""
One video shared by a local activist showed medics laying dozens of bodies on the ground at a local cemetery. An imam stood nearby leading prayers for hundreds of mourners gathered behind him in orderly rows.
Safaa al-Bayouk, a 42-year-old mother of six, said her sons Muath, who was six weeks old, and Moataz, who was one year and four months, were killed in one of the strikes.
""I gave them dinner and they went to sleep. It was a normal day... [then] the world turned upside down,"" she told Reuters news agency.
Reem al-Zanaty, 13, said her uncle's family, including her 12-year-old cousin Menna, were killed when their two homes were bombed.
""We didn't feel or hear anything until we woke up with rubble on us,"" she said. ""The Civil Defence did not come. I will tell you honestly we pulled ourselves [out]. My father helped us.""
Medics said local journalist Hassan Samour, who worked for Hamas-run al-Aqsa Radio, was killed along with 11 members of his family when their home in the eastern Bani Suheila neighbourhood was struck.
Reem al-Zanaty said she woke up covered in rubble after an overnight strike on her home and had to be rescued by her father
In northern Gaza, the Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of four people following Israeli strikes in the northern town of Beit Lahia and two others in the central town of Deir al-Balah.
Later, spokesman Mahmoud Basal reported that an Israeli strike on a home in Jabalia town had killed all five members of the Shihab family.
Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that 15 people were killed, including 11 children, when the al-Tawbah health clinic and prayer hall in the al-Fakhouri area of Jabalia refugee camp was bombed.
A graphic video posted online purportedly from the scene showed two bodies covered in debris on a street next to a badly damaged building.
""An indescribable crime, in all meanings of the word. They were safe in a medical clinic, civilians, children, women, men, something a person can't fathom, for them to release a military missile on a medical clinic, on people and passers-by,"" resident Yehya Abu Jalhoum told Reuters.
Amir Selha, a 43-year-old resident of northern Gaza, told AFP news agency: ""Tank shells are striking around the clock, and the area is packed with people and tents.""
He also said Israeli military drones had dropped leaflets over his neighbourhood warning residents to move south.
The military said it had struck 130 ""terror targets"" throughout Gaza over the past two days, including cells of fighters, rocket launchers and infrastructure sites.
On Wednesday, Israeli strikes killed at least 80 people across the territory, including 59 in Jabalia town and refugee camp, according to hospitals and the Civil Defence.
The military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in the north on Tuesday night. It had warned residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas to evacuate on Tuesday after rockets were launched into Israel.
Israeli evacuation orders issued on Wednesday afternoon also caused panic among residents of a crowded area of Gaza City, in the north.
The Israeli military said a hospital, a university and several schools sheltering displaced people in the Rimal neighbourhood had become ""terrorist strongholds"" and that it would soon attack them with ""intense force"".
Israeli aircraft carried out strikes on the northern Jabalia area on Thursday afternoon
Separately, a US-backed organisation said it would start work in Gaza within two weeks as part of a new and heavily criticised US-Israeli aid distribution plan.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it had asked Israel to let the UN and others resume deliveries until it was set up, and also to allow it to set up aid distribution sites in the north as well as the south.
Israel's UN envoy, Danny Danon, said he was ""not familiar with those requests"", but he confirmed that the ""major operation"" would start very soon.
UN spokesperson Farhan Haq meanwhile reiterated that it would not participate in the plan, saying it ""does not accord with out basic principles, including those of impartiality, neutrality [and] independence"".
Israel has not allowed any aid or other supplies into Gaza for 10 weeks, and an assessment by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) has warned that half a million people face starvation.
Israel imposed the blockade on 2 March and resumed its offensive against Hamas two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining 58 hostages, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of food.
Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 53,010 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,876 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Undergraduate Logan Rozos told the crowd on Wednesday that he condemned the ""atrocities currently happening in Palestine"", drawing cheers and some boos. 
An NYU spokesperson accused Mr Rozos of lying about what he had planned to say in the address in order to ""express his personal and one-sided political views"".
Pro-Palestinian advocacy on college campuses has become heavily politicised in the US, as the Trump administration cracks down on what it has called antisemitism at elite institutions, stirring a fraught debate about free speech.  
NYU said it ""strongly denounces"" and was ""deeply sorry"" for Mr Rozos' remarks, adding: ""This moment was stolen by someone who abused a privilege that was conferred upon him.""
The college spokesman, John Beckman, said Mr Rozos' diploma would be withheld while NYU pursued disciplinary action against him. 
After being introduced on stage, the undergraduate said he had been ""freaking out about this speech"", but that he felt compelled to speak out. 
""The genocide currently occurring is supported politically and military by the United States, is paid for by our tax dollars and has been live-streamed to our phones,"" he said. 
""I condemn this genocide and complicity in this genocide,"" Mr Rozos added in remarks that lasted about two-and-a-half minutes. 
He did not specifically mention Israel, which emphatically denies accusations of genocide in Gaza, or Jewish people.
A since-deleted profile of Mr Rozos on NYU's website indicated he studied cultural criticism and political economy at a small liberal arts school within the campus. 
In another online profile, Mr Rozos is described as an ""actor, artist, and gay Black trans man"". 
NYU is one of 10 universities being investigated by Trump's antisemitism taskforce for incidents on campus since the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023. 
NYU was not, however, among 60 universities that were sent letters by the Department of Education warning of ""enforcement action"" if it did not protect Jewish students.
The US president's son, Barron, is a student at NYU, enrolled at its Stern School of Business.
Arguably the university under the most pressure from the administration is America's oldest, Harvard.
Trump has cut more than $2.6bn (Â£2bn) in funding, a decision that the university argues will hamper critical disease research. 
Harvard has filed a lawsuit claiming the action is unlawful. It has also rejected a list of demands that the Trump administration said was designed to curb alleged discrimination.
Separately, several foreign students who took part in pro-Palestinian activism on US campuses have been detained in recent months.
The Trump administration alleges they have expressed support for Hamas, which the US, EU and UK designates as a terrorist group, and called for their deportation. 
Lawyers for the students say they are exercising their right to free speech, accusing the government of ""open repression of student activism and political speech""."

""I don't think we're going to have a breakthrough here until President Trump and President Putin interact directly on this topic,"" he said after a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in southern Turkey.
Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed Ukraine would send a delegation for the talks in Istanbul, but criticised the ""low-level"" delegation being sent by Moscow. 
Its head, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, insisted the Kremlin team had ""all the necessary competencies"".
Earlier in the day, Trump - who is visiting the Middle East - also suggested that significant progress in peace talks was unlikely until he and Putin met in person.
Asked by the BBC on board Air Force One if he was disappointed by the level of the Russian delegation, he said: ""Look, nothing's going to happen until Putin and I get together"".
""He wasn't going if I wasn't there and I don't believe anything's going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together,"" he added. ""But we're going to have to get it solved because too many people are dying.""
Trump said he would attend talks in Turkey on Friday if it was ""appropriate"" but later said he would probably return to Washington.
Delegations from Turkey, the US, Ukraine and Russia had been due to meet in Istanbul on Thursday for the first face-to-face Ukraine-Russia talks since 2022. As of Thursday evening, no time for them to take place had been set. Some reports suggest they may now happen on Friday.
Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks on 15 May in Istanbul in response to a call by European leaders and Ukraine for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.
Zelensky then challenged Putin to meet him in person, but on Thursday the Kremlin said that the Russian president was not among officials due to travel.
Following a bilateral meeting with Erdogan in Ankara, Zelensky accused Moscow of ""disrespect"" towards Trump and Erdogan because of the Russian delegation's lack of seniority and reiterated his challenge to the Russian leader to meet him personally.
""No time of the meeting, no agenda, no high-level of delegation - this is personal disrespect to Erdogan, to Trump,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Medinsky told reporters in Istanbul that Russia saw the talks as a ""continuation"" of failed negotiations in 2022 that took place shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour.
""The task of direct negotiations with the Ukrainian side is to sooner or later reach the establishment of long-term peace by eliminating the basic root causes of the conflict,"" Medinsky said.
The Ukrainian delegation will be headed by its Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, according to a decree from Zelensky issued on Thursday. It will also include its deputy heads of intelligence, military general staff and foreign ministry.
Medinsky, who led previous rounds of failed negotiations with Ukraine in 2022, will lead the Russian delegation, a statement from the Kremlin said. Russia's deputy defence minister, deputy foreign minister and military intelligence head will also be there.
The head of Moscow's delegation, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, insisted the Kremlin team had ""all the necessary competencies""
The Istanbul talks mark the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since the unsuccessful effort in 2022.
Russia has indicated it wants to pick up where they left off.
The terms under discussion included demands for Ukraine to become a neutral country, cut the size of its military and abandon Nato membership ambitions - conditions that Ukraine has repeatedly rejected as tantamount to capitulation.
Fighting in Ukraine rages on, with Russia saying its forces had captured two more villages in the eastern Dontesk region on Thursday.
Moscow now controls approximately 20% of Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it illegally annexed in 2014.
UK Defence Minister John Healey called on Ukraine's allies to ""put pressure on Putin"". Speaking after a meeting with German counterpart Boris Pistorius in Berlin on Thursday, Healey urged further sanctions on Russia ""to bring him to the negotiating table""."

When a 23-year-old Mexican influencer was shot dead while live streaming on TikTok, rumours began to swirl. Was it a cartel hit? Or another tragic example of violence against women?
On Tuesday, Valeria MÃ¡rquez was shot dead at Blossom The Beauty Lounge, a beauty salon owned by the victim in Zapopan, a town in the central-eastern state of Jalisco.
The state prosecutor's office said it was investigating the crime as a femicide, meaning that it believes the crime was motivated by the fact the victim was a woman.
The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said an investigation was under way: ""We're working to catch those responsible and find out why this happened.""
But the fact that the crime took place in Jalisco, the state where the feared Cartel Jalisco Nueva GeneraciÃ³n (CJNG) emerged, led to speculation by some that the cartel may somehow be involved.
Friends and family of MÃ¡rquez gather after her funeral mass
Ms MÃ¡rquez was a Mexican model who began to make a name for herself in 2021 after winning the Miss Rostro (Miss Face) beauty pageant, according to Mexican media reports.
Shortly thereafter, she began creating content on social media. She would share make-up tips and personal care routines, talk about fashion and show off her travels.
Photos of her on private jets and yachts can be seen on her Instagram account, which had more than 223,000 followers at the time of her death.
Ms MÃ¡rquez also had another 100,000 followers on TikTok.
Although it is unclear exactly what happened, during her final livestream, Ms MÃ¡rquez said she was waiting for a courier she knew to deliver a gift.
She added that she was a bit worried, because her friend could not see the courier's face when he arrived.
""Why didn't he just drop it off (the gift)? Were they going to pick me up (kidnap me) or what?"" she wondered aloud to her followers.
While holding a pink stuffed animal, Ms MÃ¡rquez looked away from the camera and immediately grabbed her chest and belly before collapsing into her chair.
Another woman then took the phone and ended the livestream.
Police arrived at the scene around 18:30 local time (12:30 GMT) and confirmed Ms MÃ¡rquez's death, according to the state prosecutor.
Authorities say that at least two men on motorcycles arrived at the salon and one of them asked the victim if she was Valeria. When she replied ""yes"", he pulled out a gun and shot her at least twice before fleeing.
Investigators say they are checking CCTV footage and tracking Ms MÃ¡rquez's social media accounts for clues as to who the attackers might be.
Mexican beauty influencer shot dead during TikTok livestream
A few days before MÃ¡rquez was killed, a candidate for mayor was also killed
But the salon's location in the wealthy Zapopan area of Guadalajara has raised questions about the motive for the crime. While the presence of private security and the tidyness of its streets give the impression that Zapopan is a safe area, in reality it is one of the most violent municipalities in Jalisco. In fact, shootings regularly occur in the area's luxurious shopping centres.
More than half of the real estate and commercial development in the area is connected to the laundering of drug trafficking money, according to the US Department of Justice.
Jalisco ranks sixth among Mexico's 32 states, including Mexico City, in terms of homicides, with 906 murders registered since the beginning of President Claudia Sheinbaum's term in October 2024, according to data consulting firm TResearch.
It is also one of the Mexican states most affected by the cartels. It was here, 50 kilometres from Zapopan, that a cartel training centre was found in March, and it is here that 15,000 people have disappeared since 2018.
The same day that Ms MÃ¡rquez was killed, a former congressman named Luis Armando CÃ³rdoba DÃ­az was murdered just two kilometres away, according to the newspaper Reforma.
According to the state of Jalisco, as many as 90% of crimes are never reported or investigated. The state attorney's office has also long been accused of having links to cartels, which it denies.
The prosecutor's office said that so far they had no reason to suspect that Ms MÃ¡rquez's murder was ordered or carried out by any of the organised criminal groups operating in the area.
Instead, the office suggested the murderer may have been motivated to kill her because of her gender.  
Mexican media outlets had previously published messages in which Ms MÃ¡rquez blamed her ex-partner if anything happened to her.
Mayor of Zapopan Juan JosÃ© Frangie said his office had no record of Ms MÃ¡rquez requesting help from the authorities due to threats against her, adding ""a femicide is the worst thing"", according to news agency AFP.
""In response to claims pointing to alleged perpetrators of the femicide in Zapopan, we clarify that there are no direct accusations against any individual in the investigation file,"" the Jalisco prosecutor's office said in a statement.
""All statements and clues, including videos and social media posts, are being analysed. The investigation is being conducted under the femicide protocol, with a gender perspective, without revictimisation and in accordance with the principles of legality, impartiality and respect for human rights,"" it added.
Gender-based violence is a serious problem in Mexico, a country that ranks fourth in Latin America and the Caribbean for rates of femicide, behind Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia.
According to the latest data from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), there were 1.3 deaths per every 100,000 women in Mexico in 2023, Reuters reported.
Less than 48 hours before Ms MÃ¡rquez's murder, Yesenia Lara GutiÃ©rrez, a mayoral candidate for Morena (the ruling party) in the city of Texistepec, Veracruz, was killed while participating in a political motorcade. Like the influencer's case, the politician's murder was recorded by cameras because the event was being live-streamed on Facebook."

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed it had launched a formal inquiry into the allegations, saying the probe was in the ""early stages"". 
The investigation comes after a lawsuit was filed last week by four anonymous housekeepers against the 85-year-old singer-songwriter, accusing him sexual battery, false imprisonment, negligence and gender violence.
Mr Robinson has denied the allegations. His lawyer has said those behind the accusations are after the musician's money, and he welcomed the police investigation ""because exposure to the truth is a powerful thing"". 
""We feel confident that a determination will be made that Mr Robinson did nothing wrong, and that this is a desperate attempt to prejudice public opinion and make even more of a media circus than the Plaintiffs were previously able to create,"" the attorney, Christopher Frost, said in a statement to the BBC. 
He argued the police investigation was only opened because the plaintiffs filed a formal report with their allegations and said the claims were ""manufactured"" and designed to ""tarnish the good names"" of the musician and his wife, who is also named in the lawsuit and accused of contributing to a hostile work environment. 
The sheriff's department told the BBC in a statement that its Special Victims Bureau was ""actively investigating criminal allegations involving William Robinson AKA 'Smokey Robinson.' The investigation is in the early stages, and we have no further comment.""
The women filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court on 6 May under the pseudonyms Jane Doe 1, 2, 3 and 4.
In the 27-page legal action, they allege several incidents that they say dated back to 2006, and accuse Mr Robinson of pressuring them into sex.
All four women, who are of Hispanic descent, said they had not come forward until now because they feared losing their livelihoods, familial reprisal or embarrassment. Some were concerned the allegations could affect their immigration status.
They are seeking at least $50m (Â£38m) in damages and a jury trial.
Mr Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one records like Mary Wells' My Guy and The Temptations' My Girl.
He was both a talent scout for the record label and one of its most prominent recording artists in his own right, known for songs like Tracks of My Tears, Shop Around and Tears of a Clown.
He has spots in both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and claims to have credits on more than 4,000 songs.
The women's lawyers held a press conference last week after filing the lawsuit, accusing Mr Robinson of being a ""serial and sick rapist"" who ""must be stopped"".
Mr Robinson's legal team called the event a ""bizarre"" attempt ""to enlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create"".
""We will have more to say in the coming days as we make our legal response, and in time Mr Robinson will respond in his own words,"" Mr Frost said, noting that the musician's legal team plans to ask for the case to be dismissed. 
""We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold."""

Listen to Damian read this article
On a warm morning earlier this month, a group of Metropolitan Police diplomatic protection officers sat in an anteroom off the ornate entrance hall in London's Lancaster House, sipping tea and nibbling chocolate biscuits, while upstairs a core group of European politicians discussed the future of European cooperation.
It was an apt setting: everywhere you look in Lancaster House, there is evidence of the long, entangled histories of the UK and Europe. The double sweep of its grand staircase deliberately echoes the Palace of Versailles. Queen Victoria sat in these rooms listening to Frederic Chopin play the piano in 1848. Tony Blair hosted Russian President Putin here for an energy summit in 2003.
The important issues on the agenda at the Lancaster House meeting, which was hosted by the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, included the latest developments in the war in Ukraine, Europe's response to ensure the continent's security, and â for the first time since Brexit â a summit between the UK and the European Union, which will take place on 19 May.
The British government believes it's a significant moment.
Before Brexit, UK prime ministers regularly visited Brussels for EU meetings
Before Brexit, British prime ministers would travel to Brussels four times a year or more for summits with the heads of the EU's institutions and its 27 member states. The haggling would go on late into the night. After Brexit those large summits stopped.
Now, the Labour government, elected last year on a manifesto that promised ""an improved and ambitious relationship with our European partners"", envisages new and regular interactions with the EU. Monday's marks the first. 
Sir Keir Starmer will host the most senior EU leaders to launch a new ""partnership"".
Pedro Serrano, the EU ambassador to London, has described it as the ""culmination of enhanced contacts at the highest levels since the July 2024 [UK] elections"". But what will it amount to?
Is what's coming a ""surrender summit"" as the Conservatives warn; ""the great British sellout"" undoing bits of Brexit that Reform UK fear; or ""a huge opportunity"" the UK may be about to squander, as Liberal Democrats say? Or could it be an example of how, in Sir Keir Starmer's words, ""serious pragmatism defeats performative politics"" by delivering practical things that will improve people's lives?
In those long, drama-filled nights of 2020, when the then-prime minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, the possibility of a Security and Defence Partnership was discussed. But the UK's main priority was diverging from Brussels. So nothing was agreed â a notable omission, some think.
Now a new UK-EU security pact has been worked on for months, the plan is for it to be the centrepiece of what's agreed.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said despite past tensions, 'we need to move forward with this partnership'
Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, who is overseeing negotiations, was at the early talks at Lancaster House. ""Our relationship has had some difficulties,"" she told me, but ""considering what is going on in the world [â¦] we need to move forward with this partnership.""
Yet some think the UK should not seize this outstretched hand.
""The cornerstone of our defence is Nato,"" Alex Burghart, a Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. ""We know of no reason why Nato is insufficient.""
Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice has his own view. ""There's no value at all,"" he argues. ""We do not want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military structure. Our defence is guaranteed by Nato.""
The government fires back on that point, arguing that a partnership will in no way undermine Nato; rather it will complement it, they say, because it will stretch to areas beyond defence, like the security of our economies, infrastructure, energy supplies, even migration and transnational crime.
Some industry experts also believe that a security pact could boost the UK economy. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms, is among them.
Take, for example, the SAFE (Security Action For Europe) programme that is being set up by the EU, aiming to provide up to â¬150bn (Â£126bn) in loans for new projects. If the UK strikes a security partnership with the EU, then British weapons manufacturers could potentially access some of that cash.
""There is a huge amount of interest from European partners,"" says Mr Craven. ""One of the challenges for defence companies in the last couple of years, since the advent of Ukraine, is being able to scale up their own capacity to meet demand."" He estimates the UK could boost the EU's defence output by a fifth.
The UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine
The Liberal Democrat's Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Calum Miller, similarly believes that a security pact is a huge opportunity for the British defence industry - but, he adds, ""as importantly, it's a new strategic opportunity for the UK to be part of that ongoing conversation about how we arm as a continent"".
Others point out that the UK has already been working with the EU on defence ever since Russia's invasion of Ukraine â at Nato, and most recently via the so-called Coalition of the Willing.
So, in practice, does it make huge amounts of difference to the UK's place in Europe? 
No, argues Jill Rutter, a former senior civil servant who is now a senior fellow at the UK in a Changing Europe think tank. ""Because relations [on defence] have already been improving quite a long way.""
Some of those working on the partnership, however, argue that it will set in train new ways for the UK to engage and cooperate with its neighbours.
More contentious is the UK's desire to sign what's called a 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister leading these negotiations, told the Commons this week that the objective to lower food and drink costs is in the manifesto, so there is a mandate for it.
Inside the food industry, calls for reform have been growing. Julianne Ponan, whose firm Creative Nature makes vegan snack bars, exports to 18 countries but only a small proportion goes to the EU. She says this is because of the paperwork and inspections since Brexit. 
One of her employees had to carry samples in her luggage on a passenger flight to Spain for a meeting to make sure the food wasn't held up at the border, she says. 
""I think this will open up huge opportunities for businesses like mine.""
A 'veterinary' deal to remove some border checks on food and drink has divided 
It would also make a big difference for Northern Ireland. After Brexit, special arrangements were put in place to keep the land border it shares with the Republic of Ireland free of new impediments. But at the same time, new paperwork and inspections were put in place on food, drink, animals and plants being transported from mainland Britain across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland. They're bitterly opposed by Unionist politicians and complicate life for many businesses.
But a veterinary deal may carry political danger. It would require the UK to align some of its rules on food and drink with EU ones, and move in-step with Brussels over time. And those rules are subject to oversight by EU courts.
""I call it the surrender summit,"" says Andrew Griffith, the Conservative Shadow Business and Trade Secretary. Under this deal the UK would lose ""our freedom to set our own rules"", he adds. 
The Conservatives say they ""fought long and hard"" to ""take back control of our laws, our borders, our money"" â and that this should not now be reversed.
Reform UK has not held back in its language: ""We think prepare for the Great British sell out. That's the bottom line, and it will be dressed up as a reset,"" Richard Tice says.
""Why would you want to reset and get closer to a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that.""
But Labour's Thomas-Symonds dismisses these views as a ""rehash of the arguments of the past"".
On the other end of the spectrum is the accusation that Sir Keir is far too cautious. Calum Miller of the Liberal Democrats says he knows of businesses ""gnashing their teeth in frustration that they just can't exploit opportunities to work with and trade with Europe"".
Some have accused Sir Keir Starmer of being too cautious
His party wants the UK to explore a Customs Union with the EU. It would make moving goods easier, but mean we couldn't sign our own trade deals.
David Henig, a former senior trade negotiator, has been talking to both sides ""hoping to help, to sort of navigate them in"".
""The summit is a step forward, not a step change,"" he says, ""A slight deepening of the trade ties, rather than something dramatically new.""
A deal on food and drink checks would deliver very little, he believes, because food and drink is such a limited part of trade. ""If you were, for example, aligning UK and EU rules on industrial products, you'd get a much bigger economic impact"".
Jill Rutter thinks that a veterinary deal would not prove ""economically earth shattering"" â but if it goes well, she argues that it could provide ""early proof of concept"" for further UK-EU cooperation.
After Brexit, many British fishermen were disappointed when Boris Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before, taking significant catches from UK waters. Those arrangements expire next year. The EU wants them extended.
David Davis who, as Brexit minister, led some of the original negotiations for the UK, told me fishing was ""totemic"" for Brussels. London conceded too easily, he thinks. 
""Europeans got what they wanted first, and then we had a haggle from a weak position.""
Many British fishermen were disappointed when Johnson's government agreed to let EU boats continue much as before
So he adds, ""If I was giving advice to the government, I would say, tough it out"" and use fishing as a lever to seek concessions.
But, as the UK found before, Brussels has cards to play. Much of the fish caught by British fishermen is sold to buyers on the Continent and the UK needs access to that market.
Some EU coastal states, like France and Denmark, are prepared to drive a hard bargain, demanding that London concedes on fishing rights in return for things it wants. Early on, even signing the Security Partnership was being linked to agreement on a fishing deal. The haggling will be tough.
And finally, there's an idea that has prompted much interest in recent months: a youth mobility deal, through which under-30s from the UK and EU could live and work in each other's countries.
For a long time the government said there were ""no plans"" for such a deal â but earlier this month they changed course, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying that ""A smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people"". 
It's likely that would mean very limited numbers allowed to enter the UK, and only with a visa, for a limited time.
Under those conditions, ministers hope it would not inflate net migration numbers. It's far from what the EU would like.
The UK already has similar schemes with 13 countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Japan.
""When we are comfortable having those relationships, why are we so averse to having it with our nearest neighbours?"" Calum Miller asks, ""It just doesn't really make sense"".
Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration and people coming here to study or to work are not a particular cause for concern, says one expert
Paula Surridge, a professor of political sociology at Bristol University, argues that public views on immigration are more nuanced than many people think. ""Voters care most about what they perceive as illegal migration â small boat crossings and so on,"" she says, ""People coming here to study or to work, particularly young people, are not a particular cause for concern"" for most.
""There will definitely be a group of voters that are upset [about potential deals], but they were never going to vote Labour.""
Of those who backed Labour in 2024, she adds, about three quarters previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. The political risk to the government of signing pacts with the EU is ""smaller than it appears"", she adds.
Conservative pollster Lord Hayward is more cautious â and is concerned that a deal may pose a ""bear trap"" for the government if it's seen as providing free movement to young Europeans. ""It will provide serious difficulties for them to come to an agreement on something which could easily be portrayed as EU membership 2.0.""
Even before Sir Keir's upcoming summit on Monday, his opponents are raising that spectre.
""All of his muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,"" says Mr Griffith. ""I am worried about our prime minister, with that baggage, with those preconceived ideas, [â¦] trying to negotiate a better deal with the EU.""
Richard Tice says his party could simply undo any deals with the EU. ""If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.""
""All of [the prime minister's] muscle memory has been to get closer to the European political union,"" argues one commentator
But Mr Thomas-Symonds is of the view that Monday will show the government is ""not returning to the Customs Union, Single Market, or Freedom of Movement"", all red lines it has pledged not to cross.
Instead it will be about ""making Brexit work in the interests of the British people"".
Back at Lancaster House, the politicians have moved on, heading to more meetings in Albania and Turkey to grapple with the issues facing the continent. But in a quiet hallway in the house is a painting from the 1850s of the Duke of Wellington inspecting troops in London's Hyde Park. 
In it, he sits on a black stallion, raising his white-feathered hat to salute the cavalry - a tribute to the prime minister and military hero who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.
The upcoming summit won't be as momentous an event in the UK's complicated history with Europe. But a modern British leader about to plunge into the fray of European politics might pause for thought here â perhaps, for just a moment.

To live along the Line of Control (LoC) - the volatile de facto border that separates India and Pakistan - is to exist perpetually on the razor's edge between fragile peace and open conflict.
The recent escalation after the Pahalgam attack brought India and Pakistan to the brink once again. Shells rained down on both sides of the LoC, turning homes to rubble and lives into statistics. At least 16 people were reportedly killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling.
""Families on the LoC are subjected to Indian and Pakistani whims and face the brunt of heated tensions,"" Anam Zakaria, a Pakistani writer based in Canada, told the BBC.
""Each time firing resumes many are thrust into bunkers, livestock and livelihood is lost, infrastructure - homes, hospitals, schools - is damaged. The vulnerability and volatility experienced has grave repercussions for their everyday lived reality,"" Ms Zakaria, author of a book on Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said.
India and Pakistan share a 3,323km (2,064-mile) border, including the 740km-long LoC; and the International Border (IB), spanning roughly 2,400km. The LoC began as the Ceasefire Line in 1949 after the first India-Pakistan war, and was renamed under the 1972 Simla Agreement. 
The LoC cutting through Kashmir - claimed in full and administered in parts by both India and Pakistan - remains one of the most militarised borders in the world. Conflict is never far behind and ceasefires are only as durable as the next provocation. 
Ceasefire violations here can range from ""low-level firing to major land grabbing to surgical strikes"", says Happymon Jacob, a foreign policy expert at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). (A land grab could involve seizing key positions such as hilltops, outposts, or buffer zones by force.)
The LoC, many experts say, is a classic example of a ""border drawn in blood, forged through conflict"". It is also a line, as Ms Zakaria says, ""carved by India and Pakistan, and militarised and weaponised, without taking Kashmiris into account"".

Such wartime borders aren't unique to South Asia. Sumantra Bose, professor of international and comparative politics at Krea University in India and author of Kashmir at the Crossroads: Inside a 21st-Century Conflict, says the  most well-known is the 'Green Line'  - the ceasefire line of 1949 - which is the generally recognised boundary between Israel and the West Bank. 
Not surprisingly, the tentative calm along the LoC that had endured since the 2021 ceasefire agreement between the two nuclear-armed neighbours crumbled easily after the latest hostilities.
""The current escalation on the LoC and International Border (IB) is significant as it follows a four-year period of relative peace on the border,"" Surya Valliappan Krishna of Carnegie India told the BBC.
Violence along the India-Pakistan border is not new - prior to the 2003 ceasefire, India reported 4,134 violations in 2001 and 5,767 in 2002.
The 2003 ceasefire initially held, with negligible violations from 2004 to 2007, but tensions resurfaced in 2008 and escalated sharply by 2013.
Between 2013 and early 2021, the LoC and the IB witnessed sustained high levels of conflict. A renewed ceasefire in February 2021 led to an immediate and sustained drop in violations through to March 2025. 
""During periods of intense cross-border firing we've seen border populations in the many thousands be displaced for months on end,"" says Mr Krishna. Between late September and early December 2016, more than 27,000 people were displaced from border areas due to ceasefire violations and cross-border firing.

It's looking increasingly hairy and uncertain now.
Tensions flared after the Pahalgam attack, with India suspending the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Pakistan responded by threatening to exit the 1972 Simla Agreement, which formalised the LoC - though it hasn't followed through yet.
""This is significant because the Simla Agreement is the basis of the current LoC, which both sides agreed to not alter unilaterally in spite of their political differences,"" says Mr Krishna.
Mr Jacob says for some ""curious reason"", ceasefire violations along the LoC have been absent from discussions and debates about escalation of conflict between the two countries.
""It is itself puzzling how the regular use of high-calibre weapons such as 105mm mortars, 130 and 155mm artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles by two nuclear-capable countries, which has led to civilian and military casualties, has escaped scholarly scrutiny and policy attention,"" Mr Jacob writes in his book, Line On Fire: Ceasefire Violations and India-Pakistan Escalation Dynamics.
Mr Jacob identifies two main triggers for the violations: Pakistan often uses cover fire to facilitate militant infiltration into Indian-administered Kashmir, which has witnessed an armed insurgency against Indian rule for over three decades. Pakistan, in turn, accuses India of unprovoked firing on civilian areas.
He argues that ceasefire violations along the India-Pakistan border are less the product of high-level political strategy and more the result of local military dynamics. 
The hostilities are often initiated by field commanders - sometimes with, but often without, central approval. He also challenges the notion that the Pakistan Army alone drives the violations, pointing instead to a complex mix of local military imperatives and autonomy granted to border forces on both sides.
Some experts believe It's time to revisit an idea shelved nearly two decades ago: turning the LoC into a formal, internationally recognised border. Others insist that possibility was never realistic - and still isn't.

""The idea is completely infeasible, a dead end. For decades, Indian maps have shown the entire territory of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as part of India,"" Sumantra Bose told the BBC.
""For Pakistan, making the LoC part of the International Border would mean settling the Kashmir dispute - which is Pakistan's equivalent of the Holy Grail - on India's preferred terms. Every Pakistani government and leader, civilian or military, over the past seven decades has rejected this.""
In his 2003 book, Kashmir: Roots of Conflict, Paths to Peace, Prof Bose writes: ""A Kashmir settlement necessitates that the LoC be transformed - from an iron curtain of barbed wire, bunkers, trenches and hostile militaries to a linen curtain. Realpolitik dictates that the border will be permanent (albeit probably under a different name), but it must be transcended without being abolished."" 
""I stressed, though, that such a transformation of the LoC must be embedded in a broader Kashmir settlement, as one pillar of a multi-pillared settlement,"" he told the BBC.
Between 2004 and 2007, turning the LoC into a soft border was central to a fledgling India-Pakistan peace process on Kashmir - a process that ultimately fell apart.
Today, the border has reignited, bringing back the cycle of violence and uncertainty for those who live in its shadow.
""You never know what will happen next. No one wants to sleep facing the Line of Control tonight,"" an employee of a hotel in Pakistan-administered Kashmir told BBC Urdu during the recent hostilities.
It was a quiet reminder of how fragile peace is when your window opens to a battlefield."
391,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98p3eple9eo,2025-05-15 22:28:59,"'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in US,","The BBC's Nomia Iqbal asks Charl Kleinhaus about his refugee status in the US and about being called a ""coward""
Last week, 46-year-old Charl Kleinhaus was living on his family farm in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. With its scenic beauty, wildlife and deep canyons, it's known as ""the place where the sun rises"".
His new home - for now - is a budget hotel near an American highway. 
He and dozens of other white South Africans were moved to the US under President Donald Trump's controversial policy to protect them from the discrimination he alleges they are facing - an accusation that South Africa rejects.
Mr Kleinhaus defends the US president, telling the BBC he left his homeland after receiving death threats in WhatsApp messages. 
""I had to leave a five-bedroom house, which I will lose now,"" Mr Kleinhaus tells the BBC, adding that he also left behind his car, his dogs and even his mother. ""I didn't come here for fun,"" he adds. 
The contrast in homes couldn't be more stark. But for Mr Kleinhaus, his situation in Buffalo, New York, is already a better one. ""My children are safe,"" says Mr Kleinhaus, whose wife died in a road accident in 2006.
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.
Trump and his close ally, South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk, have even argued that there has been a ""genocide"" of white farmers in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.
In February, Trump signed an executive order granting refugee status to Afrikaners, such as Mr Kleinhaus, who he said were being persecuted.
Mr Kleinhaus is one of a group of 59 who arrived on Tuesday at Dulles airport, near Washington DC, after Trump's administration fast-tracked their applications.
He admits he was surprised at how quickly he got to the US, and that he is grateful to Trump. ""I felt finally somebody in this world is seeing what's going on,"" he says.
As he and his family arrived with others at the airport they were greeted with red, white and blue balloons. He describes the pomp and ceremony as ""overwhelming"".
Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his refugee offer?
Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?
Afrikaners are a white ethnic minority who ran South Africa during the apartheid era, implementing racist policies of segregation in the country until the regime was officially abolished in 1994.
But more than 30 years on, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands. 
That has led to anger over the slow pace of change. Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that black South Africans have suffered as well as him.
But he says: ""I had nothing to do with apartheid. Nothing, nothing, nothing.""
In January, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation - in certain circumstances, when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"".
The South African government says no land has yet been seized. But Mr Kleinhaus says once there is a government claim on your land - as he says is the case with his - it becomes impossible to function. 
""Your land becomes worthless - the land expropriation has gone too far,"" he says. ""People are scared of that. Other Afrikaners who criticise us live in a bubble.""
Some fellow Afrikaners have described Mr Kleinhaus and the group as opportunists, and that being a victim of crime is not equivalent to the type of persecution that deserves refugee status. 
Mr Kleinhaus acknowledges that the murder rate of farmers is low in South Africa, but says he does not want to be a victim. ""There are people in my area who were shot and killed,"" he says.  
He says he received threats from members of the local community: ""I'd regularly get messages on WhatsApp saying, 'we'll get rid of you, you're on my land'.""
Mr Kleinhaus says he received one message before he left for the US which read: ""We are coming for you, you better be awake.""
He also says his farming machinery was damaged, and that local police failed to act on his reports.
Claims of white genocide 'not real', South African court rules
White South Africans going to US are cowards, Ramaphosa says
Ramaphosa has called the group who travelled to the US ""cowards"", saying they do not want to address the inequities of the apartheid era. 
""As South Africans, we are resilient,"" he said earlier this week. ""We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems.""
What makes the resettlement of the Afrikaners to the US particularly controversial is that other refugees have been banned, including Afghans who earlier this week had their Temporary Protected Status removed. 
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that move was justified because the security and economic situation in Afghanistan had improved - despite criticism from opposition lawmakers and rights groups. 
Mr Kleinhaus says he is sympathetic: ""I mean, I feel sorry for the Afghans that they can't get here. But I know there's a process there. And I know when and if you are approved for the process, they take care of you.""
Does he worry he's being used as a political pawn by Trump? And that another president could potentially reverse this decision in four years' time?
Mr Kleinhaus pauses, and says: ""Yeah, it is scary, but I am a religious person. Just to be in this first group is an act of God, I believe, because there was a 0.0 something percent chance that you were selected for the first call.""
Mr Kleinhaus has come under scrutiny for antisemitic posts on social media, which have since been deleted.
Discussing one of these, he says he copied and pasted someone else's thoughts, and  that he was being administered morphine as part of medical treatment at the time - though he admits this was not an excuse. 
The 2023 post was made in a moment of anger, he adds, after he saw a video - not verified by the BBC - which purported to show some Jews spitting at Christians in Israel.
Mr Kleinhaus insists the comments were specific to one moment, and not a wider comment about Jewish people. ""Even now, if I see any person going against my religion, I will speak up against it,"" he said.
The US government is facing questions about the vetting process for those being resettled. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was not involved in the screening process for the Afrikaners as it normally would be for refugees heading to the US.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has previously stated it is screening immigrants' social media activity for antisemitism, and using it as a reason for denying applicants.  
The Trump administration has been citing allegations of antisemitism as its officials have in recent months arrested and tried to deport pro-Palestinian activists.
In a statement to the BBC, a senior DHS official said: ""The Department of Homeland Security vets all refugee applicants. Any claims of misconduct are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate action will be taken as necessary. DHS does not comment on individual application status.""
Since returning to office, Trump has launched a crackdown to reduce immigration more broadly. So, is Mr Kleinhaus concerned about any backlash to his group being offered entry to the US?
""People must not think we are just taking advantage of this,"" he says. ""We come here to make a contribution to the country. 
""I'm not worried it'll fall apart because I believe this is God's plan for me. 
""My life is in his hands. And if if he didn't want me to come, I wouldn't be here."""
392,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2yer83120o,2025-05-15 09:00:23,"US Supreme Court divided over judges' power in citizenship case,","US President Donald Trump took his bid to end birthright citizenship to the US Supreme Court on Thursday, in a case that could help further his agenda on immigration and other issues.
The case asks whether lower court judges should be able to block presidential orders for the entire country - as they have done in this case. The justices did not appear to reach a consensus as they considered both sides.
The US solicitor general argued that lower courts overstepped their authority, saying this power should be curtailed.
Meanwhile, the New Jersey solicitor general - arguing on behalf of a group of states - said siding with Trump would create a patchwork system of citizenship.
This would create ""chaos on the ground"", argued the lawyer, Jeremy Feigenbaum.
It is not clear when the court will issue its decision. If it agrees with Trump, then he could continue his wide-ranging use of executive orders to make good on campaign promises without having to wait for congressional approval - with limited checks by the courts. 
Justices across the ideological spectrum seemed to grapple with two issues during Thursday's two-hour hearing. 
There was questioning of lower courts' power to block a presidential order nationwide. And the justices also considered the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself - which critics argue violates the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.
US Solicitor General D John Sauer, arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, said lower judges did not have the right to put time-consuming legal obstacles in front of the Trump Administration's agenda.
He argued the current system ""required judges to make rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions"".
Sauer proposed class-action lawsuits - which allow large numbers of plaintiffs to sue together - as one potential alternative. However, justices and Sauer's opponents noted that this process was time-consuming and did not provide relief in emergency circumstances.
The justices grilled Sauer for over an hour, with liberal Justice Elena Kagan noting that the administration had lost on the birthright citizenship issue in every lower court. ""Why would you ever take this case to us?"" she asked.
Another liberal justice, Sonia Sotomayor, made the comparison with gun ownership, saying if any future administration wished to remove people's guns, the courts would be powerless to stop them.
Justice Samuel Alito, one of the court's most prominent conservatives, appeared critical of the lower court's power to issue nationwide injunctions.
""Sometimes they're wrong,"" he said, adding that some lower court judges were ""vulnerable to an occupational disease, which is the disease of thinking that I am right, and I can do whatever I want.""
Representatives including Democrat Nancy Pelosi attended protests outside the court
Feigenbaum, arguing on behalf of states alleging harm from the executive order, said siding with the Trump administration on this matter would be impractical and unconstitutional.
Eliminating the option for nationwide injunctions could create a patchwork citizenship system, he argued, where an individual could have status in one state, but lose it when crossing into another.
Feigenbaum said this standard would have a harmful impact on distribution of government benefits like Medicaid, immigration enforcement, and maintaining accurate statistics.
""Since the 14th Amendment, our country has never allowed American citizenship to vary based on the state in which someone resides,"" Feigenbaum said.
As the justices lobbed questions at the lawyers, a large group of protesters gathered outside to voice opposition to Trump's immigration policies.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House of Representatives, joined the demonstrators outside and read from the US Constitution.
""This is about birthright, it's about citizenship, it's about due process,"" she said.

Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?
It is unusual for the Supreme Court to hold a hearing in May, and there is no indication of when it may rule. Trump appointed three of the nine justices on the conservative-majority court in his first term.
Many legal experts say the president does not have the power to end birthright citizenship because it is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution. So, even if Trump wins the current case, he may still have to fight off other legal challenges.
Specifically, the 14th Amendment stipulates that ""all persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens"". 
In the executive order, Trump argued that the phrase ""jurisdiction thereof"" meant that automatic citizenship did not apply to the children of undocumented immigrants, or people in the country temporarily. 
Federal justices in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington, however, issued nationwide - or universal -  injunctions that blocked the order from being enforced. 
The injunctions, in turn, prompted the Trump administration to argue that the lower courts exceeded their powers.
The case being heard in the Supreme Court stems from three separate lawsuits, both from immigration advocates and 22 US states.
The Trump administration has asked the court to rule that the injunctions can only apply to those immigrants named in the case or to the plaintiff states - which would allow the government to at least partly carry out Trump's order even as legal battles continue.
Nearly 40 different court injunctions have been filed since the beginning of the second Trump administration, according to the justice department. 
In a separate case, two lower courts blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a military transgender ban, although the Supreme Court eventually intervened and allowed the policy to be enforced. 
An end - even a partial one - of birthright citizenship could impact tens of thousands of children in the US, with one of the lawsuits arguing that it would ""impose second-class status"" on a generation of people who were born, and have only lived, in the US. 
Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that a potential end of birthright citizenship could force some of these children to become undocumented or even ""stateless"". 
""There's no guarantee that the countries where their parents are from would take them back,"" he said. ""It would not even be clear where the government could deport them to."""
393,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89p7ew45e5o,2025-05-15 19:39:11,"Seventeen arrest warrants issued over Bangkok skyscraper collapse,","A court in Thailand has issued 17 arrest warrants for people connected to the building of a skyscraper that collapsed during an earthquake in March.
The 30-storey tower, being built to house the State Audit Office, was felled when Bangkok felt tremors of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck neighbouring Myanmar.
Authorities said they had recovered 89 bodies from the rubble of the tower, while seven remain unaccounted for.
Police investigating the cause of the collapse said the warrants were issued to people involved in the design, construction and building supervision of the tower, local media reported.
Police named only one of the individuals as businessman Premchai Karnasuta, a former president of Italian-Thai Development PLC., one of Thailand's largest construction firms. 
Thai media reported on Thursday that investigators had found structural flaws in a lift shaft in the building. Thai authorities are yet to release their findings into the cause of the building's collapse.
Footage showed high-rise buildings in Bangkok swaying and water falling from rooftop pools onto the streets below resulting from the strong tremors.
Buildings in the Thai capital emerged from the quake largely unscathed except for the State Audit Office - a tower made of blue glass and steel that was situated opposite the Chatuchak market, a popular tourist attraction. 
It had been under construction for three years at a cost of more than two billion Thai baht ($59m; Â£45m) before it was reduced to rubble. 
More than 400 workers were at the site when it collapsed and drones, sniffer dogs, cranes, and excavators were brought in to help with the rescue effort.
The earthquake that hit Myanmar on 28 March caused the deaths of more than 3,000 people and injured more than 4,500, with tremors felt elsewhere, including in Thailand and south-west China."

The Balkan country has provided a rare British success story in the incredibly difficult politics and diplomacy of attempting to cut illegal migration.
In 2022, around 12,500 Albanians crossed the English Channel by small boat, but the number has since shrunk massively.
The last government, and latterly this one, set up campaigns to put people off attempting the journey and far more migrants have been returned. 
Sir Keir Starmer wanted to lean into this inherited success from the Conservatives, and sought to make a virtue of being the first British prime minister to make an official visit to the country. 
But he also wanted to talk up negotiations with a handful of unnamed European countries that might temporarily take failed asylum seekers who have exhausted all avenues to remain in the UK.
Downing Street told reporters the move could stop failed asylum seekers stalling deportation ""using various tactics, whether it's losing their paperwork or using other tactics to frustrate their removal"".
The PM's spokesman added it would ensure they also cannot make their removal harder ""by using tactics such as starting a family"". 
It is an interesting idea, which draws initial parallels with the last government's plan to send some migrants to Rwanda, but is different.
The Conservatives wanted to send people to the African country immediately after their arrival in the UK, to lodge an asylum claim there or another ""safe"" country.
They argued, given the numbers arriving on small boats, a radical policy shift was needed to put people off.
Labour argued it was a vastly expensive waste of money, and scrapped the idea.
Now they are talking up their own, narrower plan.
But the curiosity is they chose to do just that while on a visit to a country that is not interested in hosting what are being called ""return hubs"".
And we were to find that out rather bluntly, when no sooner than Sir Keir Starmer had made the case for the idea, the man stood next to him, his Albanian counterpart Edi Rama, said they wouldn't be doing any more deals than the one they already have with Italy, their neighbour over the Adriatic Sea. 
Downing Street insisted its own deal with Albania was ""never planned as part of the discussions.""
In short, though, they had failed to ensure the most eye-catching idea they were talking about matched the pictures, the backdrop, the stage they were on.
Cue the Conservatives, whose own record on small boat crossings was poor, but who can point to that specific success with Albania, seizing on Sir Keir's awkward juxtaposition and branding it an ""embarrassment"".
It is another episode that serves as a reminder of just how hard it is finding workable, practical, deliverable solutions to a massive and complex issue, which plenty in government acknowledge they simply have to get a grip of.

Prosecutors say Ashley Pardo, 33, was aware of her son's obsession with violence, and ""intentionally and knowingly aided"" his violent goals in exchange for him babysitting his younger siblings.
On Monday, the student showed up to Jeremiah Rhodes Middle School in San Antonio ""wearing a mask, camouflage jacket and tactical pants but left shortly after"", police said. He was later detained off-campus.
The mother was arrested the same day after the boy's grandmother called police to say Ms Pardo had bought the gun for him.
On Saturday, the 13-year-old boy's grandmother walked into his bedroom to find him playing with live ammunition and a hammer, according to a police affidavit.
She also found a homemade explosive made from a firework, on which the boy had written the name of an Australian man who attacked two mosques in New Zealand in 2019.
The grandmother reportedly told police that Ms Pardo had taken him to a military surplus store to purchase gear, including ammunition, a tactical vest and a helmet. 
Police said that the student, who has not been named,  told his grandmother on Monday that he was ""going to be famous"" before leaving for school. 
The boy showed up at school ""wearing a mask, camouflage jacket and tactical pants"", but left shortly after, authorities said. Investigators and school officials did not know where the student was for a period of time, the court document states.
""The student was detained off-campus and charged with terrorism,"" the school said in a note to parents. The note added that he had been investigated for ""some posts the student made online"".
Prosecutors say that in January, school officials discovered a map he had drawn of Jeremiah Rhodes Middle School labelled ""suicide route"". The student then reportedly told officials that he had a ""fascination with past mass shooters, including their manifestos"".
In April, he was suspended for using a school computer to research previous mass shooting attacks. After attending an alternative school, he returned to his middle school on 8 May. 
Officials said Ms Pardo was aware of the threats made by her son.
""The Defendant expressed to the school her support of (her son's) violent expressions and drawings and does not feel concerned for his behaviour,"" the court document says about Ms Pardo.
She was charged with one count of aiding in commission of terrorism, court records show. She was released from custody on Tuesday after posting a $75,000 (Â£56,000) bail, and is due to return to court on 17 July. 
US police have been increasingly moving to hold parents accountable for their childrens' violence. 
Last year, the parents of a Michigan school shooter were convicted of manslaughter for purchasing a gun for their son as his mental health declined. 
In Georgia, the father of a 14-year-old is facing charges of murder, manslaughter and child cruelty -  the most severe charges against a parent over a US school shooting."

The body which runs Nigeria's university-entrance exams has admitted to a ""technical glitch"" which compromised some results of this year's tests, after nearly 80% of students got low grades.
Students have complained about not being able to log in to the computers, questions not showing up and power cuts making it impossible to take the examinations.
The low pass rate has sparked widespread outrage, especially after one candidate took her own life.
Faith Opesusi Timileyin, 19, who was aspiring to study microbiology at university, died after swallowing poison, her family said.
Her father and elder sister told the BBC that she had sat the exam for the second time and got 146 marks out of 400, lower than the 193 she had last year.
""The pain made her take her own life,"" her father, Oluwafemi Opesusi, told BBC Pidgin.
Generally 200 or above out of 400 is enough to get a place in university in the exams run by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).
Only 400,000 of the 1.9 million students achieved that mark, one of the worst performances in recent years.
Following a public outcry, Jamb says that students in some areas will be able to retake their exams.
One student, Favour Eke, told BBC Igbo that 10 of the 165 questions didn't appear on the screen - all she could see was the multiple choice options for the answers.
""We were told to omit the blank questions and continue the exam but it was very hard to concentrate after that,"" she said.
She has also experienced technical problems getting her results, meaning she is very unlikely to get into university this year - the third time she has taken the exams.
She sat the test in the capital, Abuja, which is not one of the centres where students can retake their exams, leaving her completely distraught.
Another student said he had trouble logging in to the computer before someone else's profile mysteriously appeared on the screen, showing different questions and then the machine briefly shut down completely.
""I did not get to answer all the questions when they told us our time was up because a lot of my time was wasted due to those technical difficulties,"" he said.
The exams body has apologised for the ""painful damage"" and ""the trauma that it has subjected affected Nigerians"".
In a press conference, Jamb registrar Ishaq Oloyede broke down in tears as he apologised.
He announced that almost 380,000 candidates in 157 affected centres from a total of 887, would be able to retake their exams starting from Saturday.
The zones that are most affected are Lagos and several states in the south-east.
Jamb blamed a failure of the computer system to upload exam responses by candidates in these areas during the first days of the exams.
It said an ""unusual level of public concerns and loud complaints"" had ""prompted us to do an immediate audit or review"". Ordinarily, this would have happened in June, it said.
The national exam, known as the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), is a computer-based test that is a requirement for those joining universities and other tertiary institutions.
The 2025 test, which was conducted in March, was marred by disruptions due to power outages in some areas.
The head of the exams body earlier this week defended the poor results, saying they reflected the ""true academic abilities"" of the students and were because of a clampdown on cheating.
Many Nigerians on social media have been calling for accountability, with some seeking Oloyede's resignation.
Opposition figure Peter Obi said that while the admission of fault was commendable, the issue raised ""a very concerning issue on glitches and the grave havoc"" in critical institutions.
Rights activist Rinu Oduala said it was ""incompetence. It's educational sabotage. He should be arrested immediately.""

There has been a sharp rise in plots by the Iranian regime to kidnap or assassinate dissidents, journalists and political foes living abroad, according to reports by Western intelligence agencies.
These attempts have escalated dramatically since 2022, with even US President Donald Trump among the alleged targets. In the UK, police are questioning a number of Iranians arrested earlier this month on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack. The BBC understands the alleged target was the Israeli embassy in London.
And court documents from Turkey and the US - seen by BBC Eye Investigations and BBC Persian - contain evidence that Iran has been hiring criminal gangs to carry out killings on foreign soil, allegations the Iranian regime has previously denied. Iranian officials did not respond to a fresh request for a comment.
One name repeatedly surfaced in these documents: Naji Sharifi Zindashti, an Iranian criminal boss, known for international drug smuggling.
His name appeared in a Turkish indictment in connection with the 2017 killing in Istanbul of Saeed Karimian, the head of a Persian TV network that broadcast Western films and programmes to Iran.
Naji Sharifi Zindashti fled to Iran after being controversially released from custody in Turkey
Iranian authorities considered Karimian a threat to Islamic values, and three months before his assassination an Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison.
US and Turkish officials believed his death was related to a mafia feud.
But when in 2019, Massoud Molavi, a defector from Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), was gunned down in Istanbul, it shed light on Zindashti's alleged role in Karimian's assassination.
Molavi had been exposing corruption at the highest levels of Iran's leadership. The Turkish police discovered Zindashti's gardener had been present at the scene of Molavi's assassination, and that his driver had been at Karimian's murder.
The police suspected the gardener and the driver had been sent by Zindashti.
Zindashti was arrested in connection with Karimian's death but was controversially released after just six months, causing a legal scandal in Turkey.  A Higher Court judge ordered his rearrest but by then he had left the country.
He then fled to Iran, raising suspicions that he might have been working for Iranian intelligence all along.
Cengiz Erdinc, a Turkish investigative journalist, claims that when those out of favour with the Iranian regime are killed, Zindashti's men are at the scene. ""It is not the first time, but there has always been a connection between organised crime and the intelligence agencies,"" he says.
Turkish investigative journalist Cengiz Erdinc
Over three decades ago, he was convicted of drug smuggling in Iran and sentenced to death. But rumours suggested his escape from prison, which led him to Turkey, may have been orchestrated by Iranian intelligence.
""If someone sentenced to death in Iran escapes after killing a guard, they're unlikely to make it out alive - unless there's more to the story,"" says someone who knew Zindashti closely. The BBC is withholding their identity for their own safety. 
""The only plausible way for him to return and live freely would be if he had been working for Iran's intelligence services, making his escape appear to be part of a planned cover story for intelligence work with Iran's security agencies and IRGC,"" they told BBC World Service.
Eye Investigations examines evidence of targeted abductions and assassinations by the Iranian regime abroad
People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube, external
In 2020, Zindashti's name appeared again in a Turkish indictment in connection with the kidnapping of Habib Chaab, an Iranian dissident who was lured to Istanbul, abducted, and later paraded on Iranian state TV. 
Chaab was sentenced to death and executed. Zindashti's nephew was arrested in Turkey in connection with Chaab's disappearance. Zindashti has denied having any role.
Then, in 2021, Zindashti was implicated in a plot in the United States. According to Minnesota court documents, communications between Zindashti and a Canadian affiliated with outlawed Hells Angels Motorcycle Club were logged in the indictment. 
Zindashti allegedly offered $370,000 to have two Iranian defectors assassinated in Maryland. The FBI intervened and arrested two men before the attack could be carried out.
Our investigation into court documents also uncovered that the IRGC and its overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, have been working with criminal organisations like the Thieves-in-Law, a notorious international criminal gang from the former Soviet Union, to carry out kidnappings and assassinations.
US and Israeli intelligence sources say Unit 840 of the IRGC's Quds Force's main responsibility is to plan and establish terror infrastructure abroad.
In March, a New York jury convicted two men associated with the Thieves-in-Law for plotting to assassinate Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-American activist. Iranian agents allegedly offered $500,000 for her killing. Just two years earlier, a man with a loaded gun had been arrested near her home in Brooklyn.
Following the 2020 assassination by the US of top IRGC commander General Qasem Soleimani, Iran vowed revenge. Since then, the US says Iran has been plotting to kill former members of the Trump administration involved in Soleimani's death, including former national security adviser John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo, former head of the CIA and secretary of state.
During last year's US presidential election, prosecutors accused Iran of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump, which Iran strongly denied.
In response to these growing threats, the US and UK have imposed sanctions on individuals linked to Iran's intelligence operations, including Zindashti, Iranian diplomats, and members of the IRGC. 
Zindashti denies ever working for the Iranian intelligence service.
In 2024, Ken McCallum, the director of MI5 reported 20 credible threats against individuals in the UK linked to Iran.
In one case in West London, a Chechen man was arrested near Iran International, a Persian-language TV station in London. He was convicted of gathering information for Iranian agents.
Last year, Pouria Zerati, a London-based presenter for Iran International, was attacked with a knife. Soon after, two men were arrested in Romania at the request of UK counter-terrorism police.
Sources in the UK security services told the BBC these men were part of the Thieves-in-Law, allegedly hired by Iranian agents.
Sima Sabet, a presenter for Iran International, was one of the targets, but an attempt to blow up her car failed.
""When they realised they couldn't attach a bomb to my car, the agents told the man to finish the job quietly,"" says Sima, who has seen the police file, says. ""He asked how quietly, and they replied, 'As quiet as a kitchen knife.'""
Sima Sabet, from Iran International, was the target of an assassination plot
After the assassination of four Iranian Kurdish leaders by masked gunmen in a restaurant in Berlin in 1992, German prosecutors blamed the entire Iranian leadership for the killings. The attack was carried out by Iranian agents and members of the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia Hezbollah movement. 
An international arrest warrant was issued for Iran's intelligence minister, and a court declared that the assassination had been ordered with the knowledge of Iran's Supreme Leader and president.
Since then, it seems the Iranian regime has been hiring criminal organisations to carry out kidnappings and killings in an attempt to avoid linking the attacks back to the regime.
But Matt Jukes, the UK's Head of Counter Terrorism Policing, says it is relatively easy for police to infiltrate criminal groups because they are not ideologically aligned with the Iranian regime.
It is what he calls a ""creeping penetration"" by Iran, which the police are trying to disrupt."

Ireland's goods exports to the United States increased by almost 400% in March as manufacturers raced to get products into the country ahead of President Donald Trump's tariffs.
Sales to the US were worth just over â¬25bn, compared to â¬5bn during March 2024.
It made March a record month for overall goods exports from Ireland with sales worth â¬37bn, almost double the â¬19bn achieved in March 2024.
The surge was lead by pharmaceuticals with sales of â¬23.6bn, up by 243% on the same month last year.
In April, Trump imposed a minimum tariff of 10% on almost all countries, while proposing extra ""reciprocal"" duties for some trading partners, including 20% on the EU.
He later suspended the reciprocal measures, giving partners 90 days to negotiate.
The US is Ireland's biggest export market and pharmaceuticals are the most important sector.
The country is a major manufacturing hub for US companies like Pfizer and Eli Lilly.
Jane Burmanje, statistician at Ireland's Central Statistics Office said: ""More than two thirds (68.2%) of export goods went to the USA (â¬25.4 billion). 
""This means, for every â¬1 worth of goods Ireland exported in March 2025, almost 70 cent went to the US.""
Last week, the Irish government revised down its economic growth forecasts due to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump's tariff policies.
It expects Ireland's domestic economy to expand by 2.5% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 2.9%.
In the event of a tariff war between the EU and US, it said growth this year would be forecast at 2%, falling to 1.75% next year.
That does not include the potential impact of additional tariffs on pharma products which were not part of the analysis.
Ireland's Foreign Minister, Simon Harris, travelled to Brussels on Thursday to meet the European Trade Commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ.
Å efÄoviÄ is leading the EU's tariff negotiations with the US.
Speaking ahead of the meeting Harris said: ""Ireland's consistent position remains that we need to get into a substantive, calm, measured and comprehensive dialogue with the United States.
""At the same time, we understand the need for the EU to undertake further internal preparations in case negotiations are unsuccessful. This is a sensible and measured approach."""

The Gambian government has announced an investigation into the sale of assets seized from former President Yahya Jammeh, following widespread public concern. 
Some of the assets, including livestock and luxury vehicles, were sold off while a panel was still investigating the wealth Jammeh amassed during his 22-year rule.
A newspaper investigation exposed alleged irregularities and an apparent lack of transparency in the sale of the assets, sparking protests organised by young people. 
In a televised address on Wednesday night, President Adama Barrow pledged ""full transparency"" in the probe, saying assets recovered ""belong to the people"".
Jammeh, who seized power in a 1994 coup, is accused of orchestrating the huge theft of government funds, as well as extensive human rights abuses, including killing and jailing his critics.
The former leader, who in 2017 fled into exile in Equatorial Guinea after losing elections, has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing.
How ex-Gambia President Yahya Jammeh's US mansion was seized
The witch hunts which traumatised The Gambia
In 2017, President Barrow set up a commission to investigate alleged corruption and financial misconduct by Jammeh during his two-decade-long rule. 
The panel, popularly known as the Janneh commission, concluded its findings in 2019 and recommended the forfeiture of assets linked to Jammeh and his associates.
The investigation found that Jammeh had allegedly stolen at least $360m (Â£270m) and spent lavishly on expensive vehicles, aircraft and real estate. 
He is yet comment on the accusations but his supporters in Gambia have dismissed the findings against him as a political witchhunt.
Jammeh's livestock - including cows, sheep and goats, - farm tractors, vehicles, and other valuables were among the assets earmarked for seizure by the state. 
In 2019, President Barrow authorised a ministerial taskforce to oversee the reclaiming of the assets, with regular updates to the cabinet.
But an investigative report published by the local Republic newspaper, external earlier this month accused senior government officials of selling the assets to themselves, friends and family at below market value.
The report went viral on social media, triggering protests in the capital, Banjul, where dozens of people, including journalists were arrested but later released. 
Following the public pressure, the government published a detailed list of the assets already sold, which included some of Jammeh's luxury cars, livestock, boats, construction equipment, household goods, parcels of land and heavy farm machinery. 
The long list showed the buyers, prices and sale dates. 
However, some of Jammeh's luxury cars like his customised Rolls Royce and Bentley were not in the list. 
It is not clear if the vehicles were sold or shipped out to him as the government had allowed him to take some items to Equatorial Guinea. 
The list sparked further outrage over how many valuable items had seemingly been sold at suspiciously low prices.
No explanation was given by the government about the prices but the justice ministry in a statement said the sale had gone through a ""legally grounded process"".
""At all times, the government acted within the confines of the law and in the public interest,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
In his address on Wednesday, Barrow said he had convened a cabinet meeting the previous day to discuss details of the sales, some of which he was learning about ""for the first time"". 
He said the country's parliament and the National Audit Office were both conducting parallel inquiries into the matter.
""Their findings will be made public, and my government will enforce their recommendations to address the shortcomings discovered and hold accountable any individual or entity found culpable,"" the president said.
He urged Gambians to remain calm, warning that his government ""will not tolerate negligence, or any wrongdoing linked to safeguarding our nation's resources"".
But activists and opposition parties have dismissed the president's assurance, saying parliament cannot be trusted with the investigation.
Yayah Sanyang, an opposition MP, has called for an independent probe, saying parliament was ""full of ruling party loyalists"".
The Edward Francis Small Center for Rights and Justice, a rights group, has demanded that the president take responsibility and freeze the sale of all seized assets.
In 2022, the US seized a luxurious mansion in Maryland, which was said to have been purchased by Jammeh through proceeds of corruption.
In its investigation, the US Justice Department said Jammeh had acquired at least 281 properties during his time in office and operated more than 100 private bank accounts.

US President Donald Trump's claim that India has offered to drop all tariffs on goods imported from his country has been swiftly disputed by Delhi.
In a statement to local news agencies India's foreign minister S Jaishankar countered the claim saying talks are still going on and ""nothing is decided till everything is"". 
The statement is in stark contrast to comments by Trump to reporters earlier in the day, when he declared Delhi had ""offered us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariff"".
India and the US are currently in talks to negotiate a trade agreement.
Jaishankar said on Thursday that any trade deal has to be mutually beneficial and  work for both countries. 
""That would be our expectation from the trade deal. Until that is done, any judgment on it would be premature,"" he told news agencies.
Trump made the comments when he was speaking at an event with business leaders in Doha where he announced a series of deals between the US and Qatar, including for Boeing jets.
The US president made the comments while speaking about Apple's plans to make iPhones in India, saying he had told CEO Tim Cook that he didn't want him to build in India because it was ""one of the highest tariff nations in the world"". 
 ""They [India] have offered us a deal where basically they have agreed to charge us literally no tariffs. I said 'Tim, we are treating you really good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years. We are not interested in you building in India. India can take care of themselves'."" 
In an earnings call earlier this month, Apple had said it was shifting production of most iPhones from China to India while Vietnam would be a major production hub for items such as iPads and Apple watches.
President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods in April. Delhi is rushing to negotiate a trade deal during Trump's 90-day pause on higher tariffs, which ends on 9 July. 
Just this week, the US and China agreed to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries - US tariffs on Chinese imports will fall to 30% from 145%, while Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall to 10% from125%.
The US was until recently India's biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade amounting to $190bn (Â£143bn).
Delhi has already lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products, but the US has a $45bn trade deficit with India, which Trump wants to reduce.
""As Trump always blamed India's high tariffs for the trade deficit, India could offer to make 90% of US exports tariff-free from day one, using a ""zero-for-zero"" approach - cutting tariffs on all goods except autos and agriculture. But the deal must ensure strict reciprocity, with both sides eliminating tariffs equally,"" says Ajay Srivastava, a Delhi-based trade expert.
Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double trade to $500bn, but Delhi is unlikely to offer concessions in sectors such as agriculture where there are deeper political sensitivities involved.
India has recently shown more openness to doing trade deals after years of scepticism.
Last week, it inked a trade pact with the UK that will substantially slash duties in many protected sectors like whisky and automobiles.
India also signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) last year - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations.
EU and India are also pushing to get a free trade agreement done this year.

Putin failed but, more than three years on, a fifth of Ukrainian territory is in Russian hands.
Russia and Ukraine are due to hold their first direct talks since the initial weeks of the war in March 2022, but as Putin himself is not taking part there seems little immediate hope of an end to the war.
Ukrainians sought shelter in underground shelters as Russian forces attacked on 24 February 2022
Launching the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two, Putin gave a fiery speech on TV declaring his goal was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine.
Russia has repeatedly painted modern Ukraine as a Nazi state, in a crass distortion of history.
Putin had already seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula eight years earlier, after a revolution that ousted Ukraine's pro-Russian president and replaced him with a more pro-Western government.
Putin then triggered a lower-level war in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, with pro-Russian proxy forces occupying territory and setting up rebel states supported by Moscow.
But the 2022 invasion was on a different scale.
Putin had just recognised the rebel states as independent. Then, as the invasion began, he said the people there - many of whom are Russian speakers - needed protection from the Kyiv ""regime"".
A day later, Putin called on Ukraine's military to ""take power into your own hands"" and target the ""gangs of drug addicts and neo-Nazis"" running the government.
He then added another objective - to ensure Ukraine stayed neutral. He accused the Western defensive alliance, Nato, of trying to gain a foothold in Ukraine to bring its troops closer to Russia's borders.
The Russian leader has long questioned Ukraine's right to exist, claiming that ""modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia"" after the communist revolution in 1917.
In a long-winded 2021 essay he even suggested ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century.  Last year he told US TV talk show host Tucker Carlson that Ukraine was an ""artificial state"".
Those comments have led many to believe that the goal of the invasion was in effect to erase the state of Ukraine. 
Russia's state-run Ria news agency explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - seemingly tying the idea of erasing Ukraine to the stated goal of the invasion. 
Ukrainian culture and identity have in fact existed for centuries independently of Russia.
Fact-checking Putin's 'nonsense' history
Zelensky - from comedian to wartime leader
Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in Ukraine in 2019
Putin has long sought to get rid of Ukraine's elected pro-Western president, and Zelensky was apparently a target from the very start of the war. 
Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound soon after the invasion, according to Zelensky's adviser, and Ukraine's elected leader said they wanted him dead.
""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two.
""They want to destroy Ukraine politically, external by destroying the head of state.""
Zelensky said later that Putin had initially tried to replace him with the wealthy head of a pro-Russian party, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was accused of treason in Ukraine and is now in Russia.
Even now, Putin continues to reject direct peace talks with Zelensky and his officials call him a ""loser"" and a ""clown"". He has spoken of the Ukrainian leader's ""illegitimacy"" - a false narrative repeated by President Trump.
As evidence Putin cites the postponement of Ukraine's March 2024 presidential election, although it is because of Russia's war that Ukraine is under martial law and elections are barred under the constitution.
Putin's own re-election in 2024 is highly questionable, as Russia's opposition leaders are either in exile or dead.
Putin has for years complained about Nato's eastward expansion as a security threat, and sees any possibility of Ukraine joining the alliance as a major red line.
Before Russia's 2022 invasion he demanded that Nato remove multinational deployments from the Central and Eastern European states that joined the Western alliance after 1997.
But it was Russia that launched military action in Eastern Europe, when it invaded Georgia in 2008 and then Crimea in 2014.
After the Crimea invasion, Nato established a continuous presence on its eastern flank - closest to Russia.
Nato has always stressed the whole purpose of the alliance is to defend territories ""with no aggressive intentions"". Sweden and Finland have joined Nato in the past two years precisely because of the perceived Russian threat.
It is part of Ukraine's constitution to join the European Union and Nato, but there was no real prospect of this when the full-scale war began.
Zelensky said as much two weeks into the invasion: ""Nato is not prepared to accept Ukraine.""
He has since said he would consider resigning in exchange for Nato membership, but Trump says Kyiv should ""forget about"" joining the Western alliance.
Putin has accused Nato of participating in the war, because its member states have increasingly sent Ukraine military hardware, including tanks and fighter jets, air defence systems, missile systems, artillery and drones.
Nato has provided security assistance and training to Ukraine, but it insists that does not make it a party to the war.
Putin's grievance against Nato dates back to 1990, when he claims the West promised not to expand ""an inch to the East"".
However that was before the Soviet Union collapsed and it was based on a limited commitment made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Gorbachev said ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time.

The most likely route is through direct talks, so the planned encounter in Istanbul has to be seen as a step in the right direction, given that it is their first meeting since the initial weeks of the war in March 2022.
But the chances of a breakthrough are slim. 
Although Zelensky made himself available for direct talks with Putin, the Russian leader stayed in Moscow and sent a low-level delegation with the aim of ""restarting"" the 2022 negotiations.
The two sides have to find a way of bridging their differences and so far have been unable to agree even on a ceasefire. 
Russia has declared two short, limited and unilateral truces, while Zelensky, his European allies and the US want a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire ""to create space"" for talks on a peace deal.
Russia wants direct talks to address the ""root causes of the conflict"", a phrase that harks back to Putin's ""maximalist"" demands at the start of the war in March 2022.
These included Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations. 
Russia also wants international recognition of its territorial gains in Ukraine reflected in any future deal, including annexation of Crimea and four eastern regions. Putin wants Zelensky and his government replaced by a ""transitional administration"".
None of these demands are realistic. Kyiv will never recognise its sovereign territory as part of Russia, even if it might accept it has been lost temporarily. It will also look for Western security guarantees to ensure Russia never invades its territory again.
Two other sticking points are control of Europe's biggest nuclear plant, the Zaporizhzhia power station currently in Russian hands, as well as Ukrainian access via the Dnipro river to the Black Sea.
Before his return to the White House and since, President Donald Trump has suggested Ukraine's president was responsible for the war with Russia.
In reality, the war began in 2014, when Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Zelensky had not even entered politics by then. Putin then ordered Russia's full-scale invasion eight years later, after months of meticulous co-ordination and denials of any such plan.
But Trump's messaging has not been altogether consistent, so it is difficult to know whether he truly believes Zelensky was to blame.
""[Zelensky] should never have let the war start, that war's a loser,"" he said in October 2024. 
He repeated that theory a day after a Russian missile killed 35 people in Sumy in April 2025: ""When you start a war, you got to know you can win.""
Trump has been accused of adopting Russian narratives on the war, and Zelensky has said he ""lives in this disinformation space"". 
However, the US president has also recognised Putin's overall responsibility.
""Biden could have stopped it and Zelensky could have stopped it, and Putin should have never started it. Everybody is to blame,"" he said. 
Asked to clarify his comments days later, he told reporters days later that he was not happy with Zelensky: ""I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job.""
Vladimir Putin has made repeated false allegations of genocide and Nazi taunts against Ukraine 
At the start of the 2022 invasion, Putin vowed to protect people in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine from eight years of Ukrainian ""bullying and genocide, during the war in the east.
More than 14,000 people died on both sides of the front line between 2014-2022, but Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide in the occupied regions never added up, and no international body has spoken of genocide. Germany's chancellor called the allegation ""ridiculous"".
The Russian taunts of Nazis in charge in Kyiv are also not correct.
Modern Ukraine has no far-right parties in parliament - they failed to get enough votes in the 2019 elections. On top of that, Zelensky is Jewish and many of his relatives were murdered by the Nazis in World War Two.
Putin condemns him as a ""disgrace to the Jewish people"", but the US Holocaust Memorial Museum rejects his claims outright, saying he ""misrepresented and misappropriated Holocaust history"".
Putin himself was accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court in 2024, although that has been rejected by the Kremlin.
Russia's attempt to stop Ukraine leaving its sphere of influence goes back years, and its initial invasion began in 2014 when pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after months of mass demonstrations.
Yanukovych had abandoned an EU deal under Putin's pressure, prompting protests that ended when snipers shot dead dozens of demonstrators. Yanukovych soon fled to Russia.
Putin quickly seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and Russian proxies took up arms against the government, occupying parts of the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Two attempts to stop the war came to nothing.
They were known as the Minsk agreements and were brokered by France, Germany and Russia itself. They reduced the scale of violence, but Zelensky has called them a trap that created a frozen conflict on Russia's terms.
Both sides accused each other of violations, and the Kremlin said ultimately the failed accords were a precursor to Moscow's full-scale invasion.
The Ukrainian leader has warned the Trump administration not to trust Putin: ""He broke the ceasefire, he killed our people.""

Tracking the war in maps
After more than three years of offensives and counter-offensives, Russian and Ukrainian forces are in a war of attrition on an active front line of more than 1,000km (629 miles).
Neither side has any realistic prospect of winning this war, although Zelensky has warned that Russia is preparing a fresh offensive in the north-east.
Russia annexed four regions in eastern and southern Ukraine after sham referendums in 2022, and yet it can really only claim to have full control of one of them, Luhansk.
Ukrainian forces were able to liberate large areas of the north and parts of the south in 2022, but more recent counter-offensives have not had the same success. 
They remain active in a very small part of Russia's Kursk region after launching an offensive in August 2024, but have lost control of all major settlements there. Ukrainian troops have also lost ground in the east.
Much of Russia's firepower has been turned towards the Donetsk region, as towns and villages are destroyed in a slow and grinding advance.
The war is taking its toll on Russia's economy, with high interest rates and inflation and defence spending this year of at least 33% of the federal budget.
Ukraine has lost a big part of its economic wealth to Russian occupation and destruction in its industrial east. Growth has been hit by attacks on its energy infrastructure.
Although inflation and interest rates are high, Ukraine has secured Western aid to cover its budget deficit.
How much has the US given Ukraine?
Tens of thousands of people have died since Putin sent in the troops in 2022.
Ukraine's president has spoken of 46,000 Ukrainian military deaths, but open source site ualosses.org suggests the number is close to 74,000.
More than 12,900 civilians have lost their lives in Ukraine, according to the UN, which says the true toll is likely far higher.
Russia rarely admits to military losses, but BBC analysis estimates that Russian deaths could range from 164,223 to 237,211.
The war has forced 6.9 million Ukrainians to seek refuge abroad, and a further 3.8 million to flee their homes inside Ukraine.
At the start, Putin did not even call it war but a ""special military operation"". Eventually in 2024 he accepted it was a war, but claimed it had been instigated by Kyiv or its ""Western handlers"".

How Russia took record losses in Ukraine in 2024
Putin appears to believe that Ukraine should remain in Russia's sphere of influence because of the historical links between the two countries.
From 1922 to 1991 Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and many Ukrainians speak Russian, especially in the east, and including Volodymyr Zelensky who is a native speaker.
Many Russians view Crimea as their own. It was annexed by Catherine the Great in 1783 and handed to Ukraine by Soviet leader Khrushchev in 1954. Ten years earlier, his predecessor Stalin had deported Crimea's Tatar population, so the majority population was ethnic Russian.
Since 1991 Ukraine has been an independent state. It abandoned its nuclear weapons in 1994 in return for guaranteed security from Russia, the UK and US which Moscow failed to respect.
Since the war, many Ukrainians have turned their back on Russian, and Zelensky himself avoids using the language in public."

The mother of an Irish backpacker who was raped and murdered in India has said she hopes an inquest into her death will ""finally lead to getting a death certificate"".
Danielle McLaughlin, from County Donegal, was found dead in a field in the state of Goa in March 2017.
A post-mortem examination at the time found brain damage and strangulation as the cause of death.
After a trial lasting eight years, Vikat Bhagat was found guilty of raping and murdering the 28 year old and received a life sentence at the District and Sessions Court in South Goa, India, in February and is now appealing the sentence.
Ms McLaughlin's mother, Andrea Brannigan, told BBC News NI ""all I ever wanted was an inquest locally so hopefully this will finally lead to getting a death certificate"".
Ms Brannigan also said, in a statement issued on behalf of her solicitor, that she was ""grateful to the attorney general"" that the inquest into her daughter's death will happen.
Her mother said she was told the inquest, which she has been calling on for years, will happen in Donegal ""on the grounds that it would be advisable, and in the interests of justice"".
Ms Brannigan said her solicitor had begun the process of providing the legal documentation to the coroner to assist in his investigation.
""I understand and appreciate that the circumstances of Danielle's case, and the fact that she was killed when abroad makes her case exceptional,"" she added.
""It is very heartening that the relevant authorities here in Ireland showed their compassion and care in agreeing to and supporting the requirement for an inquest to be held in Donegal, Danielle's home, after the horrific events that ended her beautiful life thousands of miles away.""
BBC News NI has contacted the Office of the Attorney General in Dublin for comment.
Family solicitor Des Doherty told BBC News NI an inquest was requested so a death certificate could be issued to the family.
""The family welcomes this judicial investigation in the form of an inquest in Donegal even though Danielle's death happened abroad as this is allowed in certain circumstances under Irish law,"" Mr Doherty added.
Rape victims cannot usually be named under Indian law. Their identities are often hidden in a bid to protect them from being shunned in society.
In this case, Danielle McLaughlin's family have spoken to the media to raise awareness of her case.
Ms McLaughlin had turned 28 the month before her death and had been home in Buncrana for the celebrations.
She had only been in India for two weeks when she was murdered.
The Liverpool John Moores University student had been staying in a beach hut with an Australian friend.
The pair had been celebrating Holi, a Hindu festival, in a nearby village. She left the village at night and her body was found the next day by a local farmer in an isolated spot.
Her case was brought to court on more than 250 occasions with several lengthy delays."

Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, was arrested during a protest in the US Senate over military aid to Israel and humanitarian conditions in Gaza.
Protesters disrupted the hearing on Wednesday while Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was testifying.
Mr Cohen was charged with a misdemeanour offence, while another six demonstrators were also arrested and face a number of more serious charges, US Capitol Police told BBC News.
A video shared on social media showed Mr Cohen being escorted from the building by police with his hands tied behind his back.
""Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs, and pays for it by kicking kids off Medicaid in the US,"" he said in a video after someone asked why he was ""getting arrested"".
A police spokesperson said that Mr Cohen was charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding - a misdemeanour offence often used in civil disobedience cases in the US capital.
Six other demonstrators were also arrested at the hearing and face charges including assaulting a police officer and/or resisting arrest.
Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social and political issues since it was founded in 1978 by Mr Cohen and Jerry Greenfield.
It has often backed campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.
Ben & Jerry's was bought by the multinational consumers goods giant Unilever in 2000.
The merger agreement between the two companies created an independent board tasked with protecting Ben & Jerry's values and mission.
But Unilever and Ben & Jerry's have been at loggerheads for a while. Their relationship soured in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it was halting sales in the West Bank.
The two companies are currently locked in a legal battle.
In response to a request for comment, a spokesperson for Unilever told BBC News: ""Ben Cohen takes stances as an activist citizen on issues he finds personally important.
""These actions are on his own as an individual and not on behalf of Ben & Jerry's or Unilever.""
In March, Ben & Jerry's filed a legal case accusing Unilever of sacking chief executive David Stever over disagreements over the brand's political campaigns.
At the time a Unilever spokesperson said it was ""disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public"".
The dispute escalated over the last year as Ben & Jerry's advocated for a ceasefire in Gaza."

Thirteen years after civil war forced her to leave, she's back in her native city, Homs in Syria, blinking in the sunshine as she steps off a bus crammed with returning women and children, part of a long convoy of coaches and trucks.
In a central square, they're greeted ecstatically by musicians and dancers in embroidered silk shirts.
More than 100 displaced families spent more than eight hours on the road to return to Homs from the north 
Buses bringing familes back to Homs were greeted by musicians and dancers
Fatima is one of the seven million Syrians who were displaced within their country by the conflict between the government of former President Bashar al-Assad and rebel forces. It began in 2011 and finally ended with a rebel victory in December 2024. A further six million people fled abroad in those years. In total, more than half the population was forced to move.
Bringing them back is perhaps the biggest challenge Syria now faces - because many no longer have a home to return to. But now, following President Donald Trump's decision to lift US sanctions on Syria, there's suddenly new hope that the shattered country can be rebuilt.
Fatima Hazzouri has returned to Homs after 13 years
""I'm overjoyed to be back,"" Fatima says. She shrieks in delight. The 124 families returning in the convoy have come from the north of Syria, where millions of displaced people live in tents and makeshift shelters. They've been on the road for eight exhausting hours - but it won't be an easy homecoming.
Homs, Syria's third largest city, saw some of the fiercest fighting of the war. Whole districts are still in ruins. In 2012, two rockets fired by government forces slammed into Fatima's house, largely destroying it.
Fatima jostles to get free food and clothing provided by the private Dubai-based charity Waqf al-Farah, which organised the convoy. Then she heads for the flat her family is renting until they can repair their old home. Like the other men in the convoy, her son-in-law Abdulrazaq has gone ahead, riding on top of the family's possessions piled high on a truck.
When Fatima arrives, mattresses, carpets, pots and pans are already being hauled through an upstairs window.
At Fatima's family's house only two rooms are habitable. She says building a new roof and tiling the floors will cost thousands of dollars
In the north, Fatima got occasional work picking grapes or olives. Abdulrazaq was a teacher. But he doesn't know whether he'll get work in Homs to help pay the rent for the flat.
""I don't know what our future will be,"" he says. ""We'll wait for the new government to decide.""
""The biggest problem we have is lack of jobs,"" says Khalifa al-Hakmi, who helped organise the convoy. ""People have nothing to do when they come back.""
Providing work is just part of the huge task faced by Syria's new rulers, the former Islamist rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as they try to rebuild the country.
Three million homes were destroyed. Essential services are lacking in many places. Homs, like most parts of Syria, gets only a few hours of electricity a day.
So far neither the government nor international agencies have put forward any comprehensive plan for resettling refugees. But the end of the crippling sanctions originally imposed on Syria by the US under the Assad regime means the country can again become part of the international banking system â and the economy can start to revive.
Carpenter Yasir al-Nagdali has replaced the windows and ceiling in the house he shares with his mother and pet bird
For now, though, returnees still have to fend for themselves. Yasir al-Nagdali and his mother Siham returned to Homs three years ago. Their house was a shell. But now they've replaced the windows and the ceiling and Yasir - a trained carpenter - has made their flat homely again.
There's even a canary in a cage. Keeping birds is Yasir's hobby. He can't forget how they escaped at the height of the battle for Homs. They crawled on their hands and knees as regime soldiers raked their street with machine-gun fire.
But Siham also remembers happier times in the house â such as when she got married at the age of 14. In those days, she says, there were belly-dancers at weddings â and she wore 12 different dresses, singing a song each time she changed.
 
 
For others in Homs, there's no happy return. Artist Samira Madwar sees no prospect of repairing the flat she grew up in. It was shelled, then burned, and looted by government forces.
Samira now lives on the outskirts of the city. She bursts into tears when she sees the state of her beloved old home. Amid the rubble and broken plaster littering the floor, she finds old family photographs â and the remains of a book she wrote,  that falls apart when she picks up.
""In my brain, there is a hole,"" she says. ""My paintings, my books â everything - they took it, and left us without a memory about our life.""
Despite everything, Samira stayed in Syria throughout the war. But many of her friends left the country. One was Ammar Azzouz. He trained as an architect in Homs and now researches at the University of Oxford in the UK. He's overwhelmed with emotions after coming back to his city for the first time since 2011.
""I was aching for this day when I can walk the streets, touch the stones, meet the people, look at their faces, struggling to understand the scale of loss and grief,"" he says.
But like many other Syrians who've successfully started new lives abroad, he's thinking of dividing his time between his native and adopted countries, rather than returning permanently.
""Many people are describing it as the honeymoon period,"" Ammar says, talking about the first months after the fall of Assad. 
""There's a new energy and excitement and hope and optimism. At the same time, the reality is harsh. But I think building bridges between those who are outside and inside would be fascinating, because they bring in new skills, opportunities, networks and knowledge that we need so much.""
For some returning to Homs there is no prospect of repairing their homes 
Rebuilding Syria will require all those things - and huge financial input. The United Nations estimates that 90 percent of Syrians now live below the poverty line â that's less than $2.15 USD a day.
After the family's belongings have been unloaded at their new, temporary home, Fatima goes back to visit her old house. Only two rooms are habitable, and two of her children are already living there. Just building a roof and tiling the floor would cost about $6-7,000 USD, she says. She can't imagine where such money would come from. 
But today, after 13 years away, she just wants to celebrate."

Israel is preparing a series of sites in Gaza that could be used as distribution centres for humanitarian aid in a controversial new plan, satellite images show.
The Israeli government suspended food and medicine deliveries into Gaza in March. 
Ministers said the move, which has been condemned by UN, European and Middle Eastern leaders, was intended to put pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages. Israel also accused Hamas of stealing aid â an allegation the group has denied.
The UN has said the blockade has caused severe shortages of food, medicines and fuel, and an assessment on Monday warned that Gaza's population of around 2.1 million people was at ""critical risk"" of famine.
The US confirmed last week that it was preparing a new system for providing aid from a series of hubs inside Gaza, which would be run by private companies and protected by security contractors and Israeli forces.
Images analysed by BBC Verify show that land has already been cleared, with new roads and staging areas constructed at a number of locations in southern and central Gaza in recent weeks.
Israel has not publicly said where the hubs will be, but humanitarian sources - briefed previously by Israeli officials - told BBC Verify that at least four centres will be built in the southern section of Gaza and one further north near the Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land controlled by the military that effectively divides the territory.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - an organisation set up to support the plan - initially said food, water and hygiene kits would be supplied to 1.2 million people, less than 60% of the population.  
On Wednesday it announced it would start operations before the end of May, and appeared to call for Israel to allow aid through normal channels until its distribution centres were fully operational. It also called for aid hubs to be built in northern Gaza, something not envisaged under the original plan and which had led to criticism that people would be forced to move south.
UN agencies have insisted they will not co-operate with the plan - which is in line with one previously approved by Israel's government - saying it contradicted fundamental humanitarian principles. 
A spokesperson for the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) accused Israel of seeking to use ""food and fuel as leverage, as part of a military strategy"".
""All aid would be channelled through a handful of militarised hubs,"" Olga Cherevko told BBC Verify. 
""That kind of arrangement would cut off vast areas of Gaza â particularly the most vulnerable, who can't move easily, or are otherwise marginalised â from any help at all.""
Meanwhile, Bushra Khalidi of Oxfam described the new plan as a ""farce"".
""No logistical solution is going to address Israel's strategy of forcible displacement and using starvation as a weapon of war. Lift the siege, open the crossings and let us do our job.""
It is understood that the proposed new system has not yet had final sign-off from the Israeli government.
BBC Verify used satellite imagery to identify four potential sites based on the limited available information about their locations.
The sites are similar in size, shape and design to existing open-air distribution sites inside Gaza, such as at Erez, Erez West and Kisufim. The largest site we've looked at is bigger - more comparable to the area inside Gaza at Kerem Shalom crossing.
Our analysis of the imagery shows significant development at one of the sites in south-west Gaza, close to the ruins of a village that is now an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) base.
Satellite photos since early April show the construction of a road there and a large staging area, surrounded by berms - large defensive barriers made of piled sand or earth - about 650m (2,130ft) from the border with Egypt.
A high-resolution image captured on 8 May shows bulldozers and excavators working on a section of land spanning about 20 acres (8 hectares). IDF armoured vehicles are at a fortified building nearby.
A photo taken on site, geolocated by BBC Verify, also shows lighting being installed on the perimeter.
Further imagery from 11 and 12 May shows this, along with three other sites, continuing to expand. One site is about half a kilometre from a collection of eight UN warehouses, and 280m from another large warehouse.
Stu Ray - a senior imagery analyst with McKenzie Intelligence - agreed the sites were likely to be secure distribution centres. He noted that some of the facilities are in ""close proximity to IDF Forward Operating Bases which ties in with the IDF wishing to have some control over the sites"".
Analysts with another intelligence firm, Maiar, said the facilities appeared to be designed with separate entrances for trucks to move in and out, and with other gaps in the berms that would be suitable for pedestrian entrances.
The IDF did not comment on the potential aid centres when approached by BBC Verify, but said that its operations in Gaza were carried out ""in accordance with international law"".  Cogat - the Israeli body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza - did not respond to a request for comment.
Three of the four sites located by BBC Verify are south of the IDF's newly created Morag Corridor.
This is an Israeli military zone that runs across the Gaza Strip and separates the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah.
Since the IDF established a security zone there in early April, a six-mile (10km) road has been built covering two thirds of the width of Gaza, bordered by defensive berms and dotted with IDF outposts.
This new road leads directly to one of the development sites visible in satellite imagery, and a pre-existing road connects it to two more.
This entire area has been subjected to extensive land clearance by the IDF. BBC Verify has geolocated video and images of areas throughout the Morag Corridor, and south of it, filmed by Israeli forces, which show controlled demolitions using explosives and heavy machinery, and extensive destruction of buildings.
Humanitarian sources said Israeli briefings indicated that aid would enter Gaza via Kerem Shalom crossing.
Satellite imagery shows ongoing construction work happening there too over the past few months, with the apparent expansion of its storage areas, and new roads added.
Since Israel stopped new aid supplies in March, the UN has reiterated that it has an obligation under international law to ensure that the basic needs of the population under its control are met.
Israel has insisted that it is complying with international law and that there is no shortage of aid in Gaza.
What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"

Earlier, an adviser to Iran's supreme leader told NBC News that Tehran was willing to make concessions on its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons - though Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful. 
Speaking on Thursday in Qatar, on the second stop of his multi-day Gulf tour, Trump said that a deal was close on Iran's nuclear programme and suggested a military strike on Tehran's sites could be avoided. 
""We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran,"" Trump said after a meeting in Doha with business leaders. 
""I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.
""You probably read today the story about Iran. It's sort of agreed to the terms."" 
The president did not specify which remarks he was referring to, but an adviser to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Ali Shamkhani, said in a US media interview that Tehran was willing to accept far-reaching curbs on its nuclear programme.
Shamkhani told ABC News that Iran would give up stockpiles of highly enriched uranium as part of a deal in which the US lifts sanctions.
The latest talks over Tehran's nuclear programme finished on Sunday, with both sides agreeing to meet again.
US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said they were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as ""difficult but useful"".
Trump pulled out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018.
He previously warned of possible military action against Iran's nuclear facilities if the fresh set of talks, which began in April, did not succeed.
A senior US official said the latest discussions lasted more than three hours, adding: ""Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements.
""We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future."""

Paramilitary fighters appear to have opened a new phase in Sudan's civil war after being driven from the capital, in a move which some experts have described as a ""shock and awe campaign"".
Just weeks after the army celebrated the recapture of Khartoum, its foe the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a series of unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan in the east of the country.
The attacks have led to worsening power blackouts, as well as city residents facing water shortages.
""It's a level of power projection within this region that we haven't seen yet,"" says Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa expert for the International Crisis Group.
""I think it raises the stakes quite a bit,"" he added.
The barrage of attacks on the war-time capital and humanitarian hub signals that the RSF is determined and able to carry on the fight despite significant territorial losses.
And it has showcased the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.
Drones have played an increasing role in the conflict, which has entered its third year. 
The war began as a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF and has drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) helped the army advance earlier this year. And the RSF escalated its own use of drones as it was pushed out of central Sudan, especially Khartoum, back towards its traditional stronghold in the west of the country.
In recent months the paramilitaries had stepped up drone strikes on critical civilian infrastructure in army-controlled areas. That continued on Wednesday night with attacks on three power stations in the city of Omdurman, which lies across the Nile River from Khartoum. The damage has caused widespread electricity outages in the capital region.
But it was the RSF's sustained strikes on Port Sudan, until now seen as a safe haven home to government officials, diplomats and humanitarian organisations, that underlined a shift in strategy to a greater emphasis on remote warfare, and aimed to demonstrate strength.
Some people had fled more dangerous parts of the country to seek safety in Port Sudan, like these women who were pictured sheltering at Abdallah Nagi camp
""The RSF is trying to show that they don't need to reach Port Sudan by land in order to be able to have an impact there,"" says Sudanese political analyst Kholood Khair.
The group is trying to achieve a ""narrative shift"" away from ""the triumphant SAF that took over Khartoum,"" she says.
""It is saying to the Sudanese Armed Forces: 'You can take Khartoum back, but you'll never be able to govern it. You can have Port Sudan, but you won't be able to govern it, because we will cause a security crisis for you so large that it will be ungovernable'... They want to unequivocally show that the war is not over until they say so.""
The paramilitary group has not directly addressed the Port Sudan drone attacks. Rather, it has repeated its assertion that the SAF is supported by Iran and accused the armed forces of targeting civilian infrastructure and state institutions, calling the military strikes on Khartoum and RSF-held areas in the west and south of the country war crimes.
Both sides stand accused of war crimes which they have denied, but the RSF has been singled out over allegations of mass rape and genocide.
The change in its tactics may have been triggered by battlefield necessity, but is possible because of technological advancement.
The RSF had previously used what are known as suicide or loitering drones, small UAVs with explosive payloads that are designed to crash into targets and can carry out coordinated attacks.
It seems to have deployed this method in Port Sudan, with the commander of the Red Sea Military Zone Mahjoub Bushra describing a swarm of 11 Kamikaze drones in the first strike on a military airbase. 
He said the army shot them down, but they turned out to be a tactical distraction to divert attention from a single strategic drone that successfully struck the base.
The make of this drone is not clear. But satellite images reported by Yale researchers and the Reuters news agency have shown advanced UAVs at an airport in South Darfur since the beginning of the year. 
The defence intelligence company Janes has determined them to most likely be sophisticated Chinese manufactured CH-95s, capable of long-range strikes.
Jeremy Binnie, an Africa and Middle East analyst at Jane's, told the BBC that photos of what appear to be the remnants of the smaller kamikaze drones suggest they are probably a different version than the RSF had used before, and might be better at penetrating air defences because of their shape.
Sudan's war is taking a massive humanitarian toll with citizens fleeing their homes being hit in strikes
One regional observer suggested the RSF had been able to breach the SAF's anti-drone technology with signal jammers attached to the drones, but cautioned this was still unproven.
The South Darfur airport in Nyala, the presumptive capital and military base of the Rapid Support Forces, has been repeatedly bombed by the SAF, which destroyed an aircraft there earlier this month. 
Some experts see the RSF's bombardment of Port Sudan at least partly as retaliation.
Inside Khartoum, a city left in ruins
Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening
The escalating drone warfare has again highlighted the role of foreign actors in Sudan's civil conflict.
""This is a war of technology,"" says Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and research organisation. 
""That's why the foreign supporters are so important, because it's not like the RSF is making the weapons themselves. They're being given this stuff.""
The army has accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supplying the paramilitary fighters with the drones, and cut diplomatic ties with Abu Dhabi because of the attacks.
The UAE has strongly rejected the charges. It has long denied reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations that it is providing weaponry to the RSF.
But Mr Lynch says the evidence is overwhelming. 
He was the lead author of a US State Department-funded report late last year that concluded with ""near certainty"" the the UAE was facilitating weapons to the RSF by monitoring imagery and flight patterns of airlines previously implicated in violating a UN arms embargo. 
He told the BBC it would be surprising if the Emiratis were not helping deliver the drones used in the Port Sudan attacks.
He also determined with similar near-certainty that the Iranians were supplying weapons to the SAF, and he helped authenticate documents provided to the Washington Post that detail the sale of drones and warheads to the army by a Turkish defence firm.
Iran has not responded to the allegations. Turkish officials have denied involvement.
The increasing use of drones by both sides may be redefining the war, but it is the ability of the RSF to strike strategic targets hundreds of kilometres from its positions that has rattled the region.
Over a week of daily attacks on Port Sudan, the paramilitaries hit the country's only working international airport, a power station, several fuel depots, and the air base, apparently trying to disrupt the army's supply lines.
The city is also the main entry port for relief supplies and the UN has warned that this ""major escalation"" could further complicate aid operations in the country and lead to large-scale civilian casualties.
""This was such a shock and awe campaign that it has not only stunned SAF, I think it's also stunned Egypt, Saudi Arabia, others who were behind SAF, and remakes the entire war,"" says Mr Boswell, adding that it closing the gap in air power between the RSF and the army.
""The RSF is widely viewed as a non-state actor,"" he says ""and normally, groups like that can muster quite a bit of an insurgent force. But the government with the air force is the one that always has the aerial capacity, and this just turns all those old adages on its head.""
The development has triggered comparisons to the long-range drone warfare between Russia and Ukraine.
""These weapons have more precision, you don't need a manned aircraft any more, and they are much more affordable than operating sophisticated jets,"" says Mr Binnie. 
""This is part of a broader trend in technological proliferation where you can see what used to be really high-end capabilities being used in a civil war in sub-Saharan Africa.""
The Sudanese foreign ministry has warned that the attacks threaten regional security and the safety of navigation in the Red Sea, calling on international actors to take ""effective action against the regional sponsor of the militia,"" a reference to the UAE.
Mr Lynch believes that only an agreement between the UAE and the Sudanese army will end the war.
""This war is always evolving, always changing,"" he says, ""but you'll see it will continue for years and decades unless there is serious diplomatic action to stop it.""

A pregnant Israeli woman has been shot and killed in what Israeli authorities say was a terrorist attack in the north of the occupied West Bank.
Tzeela Gez, 30, was being driven to a hospital by her husband Hananel to give birth when a gunman opened fire on their car near their home in the settlement of Bruchin on Wednesday evening. Mrs Gez was critically wounded while Mr Gez was lightly wounded.
Doctors performed an emergency caesarean section and delivered the baby in a serious but stable condition. But they were unable to save Mrs Gez's life.
The Israeli military said its forces were pursuing the gunman. Troops reportedly surrounded the nearby Palestinian village of Bruqin afterwards.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was ""deeply shocked by the horrific attack in [the northern West Bank] against a pregnant woman and her husband, while they were making their way to the delivery room"".
""This despicable event reflects exactly the difference between us - those who cherish and bring life - and the despicable terrorists whose life's goal is to kill us and cut off lives,"" he added.
Defence minister Israel Katz said he had ordered the Israeli military to ""identify the origin of the attackers and respond with maximum force"".
There was no immediate claim from any Palestinian armed groups, but Hamas praised the attack as a ""heroic"" response to Israel's ""escalating crimes and ongoing aggression against our people in Gaza and the occupied West Bank"".
Hundreds of Palestinians and dozens of Israelis have been killed in a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.
Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war.
The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this."

A juror in the trial of an Australian woman accused of killing three relatives by feeding them poisonous mushrooms has been removed for possible misconduct.
Erin Patterson - who has pleaded not guilty - is on trial for the murder of three people and the attempted murder of another, after they ate lunch at her home in July 2023. 
The male juror was discharged on Thursday after the judge found there was a ""reasonable possibility"" he had discussed the case with family and friends. 
The judge told the court there was no definitive evidence that the man had discussed the trial with outsiders, but reminded the remaining jurors they should only talk about the case ""in the privacy of the jury room"".
Justice Christopher Beale also told the jury that confidential juror discussions were ""vital to the administration of justice"".
Fifteen jurors - three more than usual - were selected for the trial, which began a fortnight ago in Victoria and was expected to last six weeks.
After the court has heard all the evidence, the jury will be reduced to a final 12 people who will deliberate over the verdict.
Prosecutors allege Ms Patterson ""deliberately poisoned"" her guests ""with murderous intent"", after inviting them for lunch ""on the pretence she'd been diagnosed with cancer"".
Ms Patterson's defence team says it was a ""terrible accident"", and that she lied to police and disposed of evidence because she ""panicked"" after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved."

A New Zealand parliamentary committee has proposed that three MÄori MPs be suspended from parliament for their protest haka during a sitting last year.
Opposition MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke began the traditional group dance after being asked if her party supported a controversial bill - which has since been voted down - to redefine the country's founding treaty.  
The haka could have ""initimidated"" other lawmakers, the committee ruled, recommending that she be suspended for a week and Te PÄti MÄori (MÄori Party) co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer be banned for 21 days.
The MÄori Party criticised the recommendations as a ""warning shot to all of us to fall in line"".
""When tangata whenua resist, colonial powers reach for the maximum penalty,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday, using a MÄori phrase that translates to ""people of the land"".
It also said these are among the harshest punishments ever recommended by New Zealand's parliament. 
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who is MÄori, said the trio were ""out-of-control MPs who flout the rules and intimidate others with outrageous hakas"".
Their proposed suspensions will be put to a vote on Tuesday.
The Treaty Principles Bill, which sought to redefine New Zealand's founding treaty with MÄori people, was voted down 112 votes to 11 last month - days after a government committee recommended that it should not proceed.
The bill had already been widely expected to fail, with most major political parties committed to voting it down. 
Members of the right-wing Act Party, which tabled it, were the only MPs to vote for it at the second reading on 10 April. 
Act, a minor party in the ruling centre-right coalition, argued that there is a need to legally define the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi - the 1840 pact between the British Crown and MÄori leaders signed during New Zealand's colonisation - which it said resulted in the country being divided by race. 
Critics, however, say the legislation will divide the country and lead to the unravelling of much-needed support for many MÄori.
The proposed legislation sparked widespread outrage across the country and saw more than 40,000 people taking part in a protest outside parliament during its first reading in November last year.
Before that, thousands participated in a nine-day march against the bill- beginning in the far north and ending in Auckland.
Maipi-Clarke, who started the haka dance, also ripped up a copy of the bill when it was introduced."

There were villages and small towns where the lights were coming on. It was a peaceful landscape where people walked and drove without constantly looking to the sky.  
We were over the suburbs of Amman when Safa'a Salha held up her mobile phone so that I could read a message she'd written.
""Oh my God,"" this Gaza mother wrote, ""Jordan is so beautiful.""
The evacuees had come to the Jordanian border by road. I joined them there for the final part of the journey by helicopter to Amman.
Safa'a spoke very little English, and in any case the noise of the helicopter made it impossible to converse. 
She showed me another message. ""We used to see this [helicopter] every day and it was coming to bomb and kill. But today the feeling is totally different.""
Next to her sat her 16-year-old son Youssef who showed me the scar on his head from his last surgery. He smiled and wanted to speak, not of Gaza but ordinary things. How he was excited by the helicopter, how he liked football. Youssef said he was very happy and gave me a fist bump.
Beside him was nine-year-old Sama Awad, frail and scared-looking, holding the hand of her mother, Isra. Sama has a brain tumour and will have surgery in Amman.
""I hope she can get the best treatment here,"" said Isra, when we were on the ground and the noise of the engines faded.
I asked a question which had been answered for me many times by looking at images, but not face to face by someone who had just left.
What is Gaza like now?
""It is horrible. It is impossible to describe. Horrible on so many levels. But people are just trying to get on with living,"" Isra replied.
Thirty-three children have been evacuated in total to Jordan from Gaza to receive medical treatment
Four sick children were evacuated to Jordan along with twelve parents and guardians. They left Gaza by ambulance on Wednesday morning and travelled through Israel without stopping until they reached the border crossing.
The plan to evacuate children was first unveiled during a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Jordan's King Abdullah in February. 
Jordan's stated aim is to bring 2,000 sick children to the kingdom for treatment. So far only 33 have been evacuated to Jordan, each travelling with a parent or guardian. 
Jordanian sources say Israel has delayed and imposed restrictions and this - along with the resumption of the war - has impeded the evacuation process. Sick Gazans have also been evacuated to other countries via Israel. 
We put the Jordanian concerns to the Israeli government organisation responsible -  Cogat (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories) - who told us that since ""the beginning of the year, and especially in recent weeks, there has been a significant increase in the number of Gazans evacuated through Israel for medical care abroad.""
Cogat said thousands of patients and escorts had gone to countries, including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the US and others. The statement said that ""the ongoing hostilities in the Gaza Strip pose a challenge to the implementation of these evacuation operations."" 
Israel broke the last ceasefire in March launching a wave of attacks on what it said were Hamas positions.
Gaza remains a claustrophobic zone of hunger and death for its residents. Those who get out for medical treatment are the exception. 
According to the UN the population of 2.1 million is facing the risk of famine. The organisation's head of humanitarian affairs, Tom Fletcher, has appealed to the UN Security Council to act to ""prevent genocide"" in Gaza.
These are strong words for a man trained in the sober traditions of the British Foreign Office and who has served as an ambassador and senior government advisor.
The Israeli blockade is preventing essential aid supplies from reaching the population. That along with the continued bombing explain Isra Abu Jame's description of a place horrible beyond words.
The children who arrived in Jordan on Wednesday from Gaza will join a small community of other wounded and sick youngsters in different Amman hospitals.
Since January we have been following the case of Habiba Al-Askari, who came with her mother Rana in the hope doctors might be able to save three gangrene infected limbs - two arms, and a leg.
But the infection - caused by a rare skin condition - had gone too far. Habiba underwent a triple amputation.
Habiba Al-Askari's mother hopes she will return to Gaza one day.
When I met Habiba and Rana again this week, the little girl was using the toes of her remaining foot to scroll, and play children's games on her mum's phone. She blew kisses with the stump of her arm. This was a very different child to the frightened girl I met on the helicopter evacuation five months ago.
""She's a strong person,"" Rana said. Habiba will be fitted with prosthetic limbs. Already she is determined to walk, asking her mother to hold under her armpits while she hops.
Some day, Rana hopes, she will take Habiba back to Gaza. Mother and child are safe and well cared for in Amman, but their entire world, their family and neighbours are back in the ruins. Concerns about Habiba's health make Rana reluctant to contemplate going back soon.
""We have no house. If we want go back where will we go? We would be going back to a tent full of sandâ¦[but] I truly want to return. Gaza is beautiful, despite everything that has happened. To me Gaza will always be the most precious spot on this entire earth.""
They will return. But to war or peace? Nobody knows.

An Australian novelist jailed in China has in a letter to his supporters and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese detailed his ""unbearable suffering"" as he enters his seventh year in detention. 
Chinese-born Yang Hengjun was last year handed a suspended death sentence by a Beijing court on espionage charges, something he denies. 
In his letter, he thanked Albanese, saying he and the Australian government were doing their ""utmost to bring me home for medical care and reunification with my family"". 
Foreign minister Penny Wong said in a statement that she and Albanese were ""deeply moved"" by Dr Yang's letter and wanted to ""see him home in Australia, reunited with his family"". 
Dr Yang, who previously worked for China's Ministry of State Security, blogged about Chinese state affairs, but his writings often avoided direct criticisms of the government.
He was living in New York but travelled to Guangzhou in January 2019 with his wife and her child - both Chinese citizens - on a visa run when he was intercepted at the airport.
His case has mostly unfolded behind closed doors since then and in 2024, he was handed the suspended death sentence, which is typically converted to life imprisonment after two years.
At the time, Albanese described the sentence as an ""outrage"".
But China maintains that Yang's case was ""rigorously handled"" in accordance with the law. It also warned Australian officials not to interfere in the case.
Dr Yang had denied the charges but did not appeal the ruling out of concerns that it would delay medical care, his family said. There have been worries about his declining health, after a large cyst was found on one of his kidneys.
In his latest letter, Dr Yang thanked the country's leaders as well as the Australian Embassy in China for their support during the ""hardest and darkest chapter"" of his life.
""All of this solicitude and solace has helped me to bear what has been untold and unbearable suffering,"" he wrote.
He said that he still loved both China and Australia - the former the ""motherland in which [he] was born, brought up in, and made strong"", and the latter his ""beloved children's motherland"".
""I have a dream. That there is no war, no bullying, no incivility. People of different colours, cultures, and nationalities love each other like sisters and brothers.""
Wong described Yang's letter as ""a message of profound courage, resilience and hope despite extraordinarily difficult circumstances"".
Several people in both countries have been arrested and charged with espionage and foreign interference as ties between both countries have been shaky in recent years.
In 2023, Chinese-Australian businessman Sunny Duong was found guilty of trying to influence a former minister with donations.
The same year, Australian journalist Cheng Lei was released after more than three years of detention in China on accusations of ""illegally supplying state secrets overseas""."

Valeria MÃ¡rquez was killed when a man entered her beauty salon in the city of Guadalajara ""and apparently fired a gun at her"", according to the Jalisco state prosecutor's office.
The motive for the fatal attack has not been identified but the case is being investigated as a femicide - when women and girls are killed because of their gender, the state prosecutor said.
Gender-based violence is highly common in Mexico where the UN reports 10 women or girls are murdered every day by partners or family members.
Moments before her death, Ms MÃ¡rquez was sitting at a table holding a stuffed animal at her beauty salon in the suburb of Zapopan doing a livestream.

The prosecutor's office did not name a suspect.
Fans of Ms MÃ¡rquez, whose social media following totalled nearly 200,000 across TikTok and Instagram, have reacted with horror to her death.

Australian Football League (AFL) player and coach Robert Walls has died aged 74, after using voluntary assisted dying laws.
Walls - a Carlton Football Club legend - won three premierships with the team as a player and one as coach, and later became a media figure and pundit.
He was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a rare and aggressive form of blood cancer, in 2023.
His family told local media he died surrounded by his children, in his apartment which overlooked the home of AFL in Victoria, the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
The state of Victoria introduced voluntary assisted dying laws in 2019, which allow a person in the late stages of advanced disease to end their life using medication, with the approval of two doctors.
In a statement, Walls' family said he died on Thursday morning, local time, ""after 14 years as a league player, 16 years as a coach, 25 years as a commentator and a lifetime as a self-proclaimed 'fan'"".
""Having battled cancer for more than two years, Robert did it his way and chose to end a fight that had seen him spend more than 250 nights in hospital during the past two years,"" the statement continued.
In a post on X, Carlton FC paid tribute to the sporting icon, describing him as ""one of our game's great servants"".
Walls played more than 200 matches for Carlton FC, winning premierships in 1968, 1970 and 1972. 
His coaching career included a 1987 win for Carlton, as well as guiding the Brisbane Lions and Richmond Tigers. He retired in 1997 and became a well-known AFL commentator.

Georgetown University researcher Badar Khan Suri has been freed from a Texas detention centre after he was arrested as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.
A federal judge ordered the release of Mr Suri, who was a postdoctoral fellow at the prestigious Washington DC institution on a student visa.
An Indian national, he was arrested outside his Virginia home on 17 March by immigration agents.
His lawyers say he was targeted ""for speech in support of Palestinian rights and family ties to Gaza"". US authorities accuse him of ""spreading Hamas propaganda"" and having ""connections to a known or suspected terrorist"".
The Justice Department argued the government had a right to detain him until court proceedings finished.
However US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled on Wednesday his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. 
She refuted the government's claims he had ties to Hamas through his wife Mapheze Saleh, a US citizen whose father was a government official in Gaza. 
""There was no evidence submitted to this court regarding statements that he made"" in support of Hamas, the judge said according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.
Mr Suri's father-in-law is a former adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh who was killed in July last year, the Washington Post and New York Times reported.
In her court statement, Ms Saleh said her father lived in the US for nearly 20 years while studying. ""Afterward, he served as political advisor to the Prime Minister of Gaza and as the deputy of foreign affairs in Gaza,"" she said.
Ms Saleh said he left the Gaza government in 2010 and started an institute to encourage peace and conflict resolution in Gaza in 2011.
""Hearing the judge's words brought tears to my eyes,"" Ms Saleh said in a press release from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is involved in Mr Suri's defence. 
 ""I truly wish I could give her a heartfelt hug from me and from my three children, who long every day to see their father again,"" she said.
""Speaking out about what's happening in Palestine is not a crime.""
The Trump administration is still seeking to deport Mr Suri in separate proceedings, the ACLU said.
Several students and academics have been investigated by US immigration officials in recent weeks, accusing them of advocating for ""violence and terrorism"".
Among them was Columbia University graduate and permanent US resident Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested on 8 March after being involved in pro-Palestinian protests on campus. He was accused of having ties to Hamas, which he denies.
Badar Khan Suri's release comes days after Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk was released on bail after a court order.
Ms Ozturk was kept in a Louisiana detention facility after officials arrested her on the street in Massachusetts in March, and accusing her of ""engaging in activities in support of Hamas""."

""Promoting South Africa is something I am passionate about - I have no intention of taking up [US President Donald Trump's] offer because South Africa is my home,"" the proud Afrikaner tells the BBC, days after a small group of his fellow white compatriots left South Africa for their new life as refugees in the US.
The US president, and his South-Africa born ally Elon Musk, says that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a ""genocide"".
This is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited.
Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race.
""For me, South Africa is home. It's a place where my roots and heritage are, where I can contribute to the story of our nation and make a meaningful impact,"" said Mr Janse van Vuuren, who has more than one million followers on social media.
""I'm deeply invested in South Africa's success and I am proud to be part of its journey.""
And while he wished those who have taken up Trump's offer all the best in the US and urged them to ""not look back"", he insisted that none of them were refugees, but rather ""opportunists"".
""They've enjoyed more than their share of South Africa's resources and privileges, and none are fleeing racial persecution,"" he said.
Thirty years after the end of the racist system of apartheid, average living standards among South Africa's white community remain far higher than for the black majority.
Mr Janse van Vuuren said that the debate about the status of Afrikaners in South Africa had only served to make him ""more determined than ever to step up and contribute to South Africa in every way I can"".
Four centuries after the first group of Dutch settlers arrived in what is now South Africa, most Afrikaners regard themselves as fully African â as seen in the name â and no longer identify with their European roots.
But many are unhappy both with the high crime rate and the government's policies aimed at reducing economic inequality in the country â especially a law passed earlier this year that allowed the government to seize land without compensation ""when it is just and equitable and in the public interest"". White South Africans are 7% of the country's population, but own half of its farmland. 
Some Afrikaners are farmers and see the law as being aimed at them. 
Trump said the legislation prompted him to offer to help resettle ""Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination"".
The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics.
But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture.
South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.
The first group of 59 Afrikaner refugees are looking forward to their new lives in the US
On Monday, the first group of 59 Afrikaners granted refugee status arrived at the Dulles airport near Washington DC after choosing to leave their home country.
The arrival of the group drew dismay and outrage across South Africa, as the country's civil society and leadership sought to dispel the claims that the white minority was being persecuted.
""They are leaving because they don't want to embrace the changes that are taking place in our country and our constitution,"" said South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
He later labelled their move a ""cowardly act"" as he addressed farmers at a convention held in the Free State province.
The president's sentiments were echoed by many South Africans, including Mr Janse van Vuuren, who is proud of his Afrikaner origins.
While he was not raised in a farming family, he has relatives and friends in agriculture who have been victims of crime.
He said that while it was undeniable that some farmers faced ""genuine threats and hardships"", it was important to be cautious ""when discussing claims of persecution or discrimination that portray an entire group as victims of targeted violence or systemic oppression"". 
While many white South Africans echo Mr Janse van Vuuren's sentiments, there are also those who see themselves as a persecuted minority.
Among them is Ilse Steenkamp, who along with her family, has applied for the programme but has not received feedback. She did not want us to use her real name.
Ms Steenkamp, 47, and her husband, both Afrikaners, were commercial farmers but said they had lost their land recently after it was invaded by people who ""took over the whole farm"" just as they were about to sell it in order to ""downscale"".
She said they had bought the land two decades ago, after the end of apartheid.
The people who invaded destroyed critical infrastructure, making it impossible to sell, she said. 
Despite efforts to have them removed through the courts, Ms Steenkamp said they were forced to abandon the land as it was repossessed by the bank.
Ms Steenkamp said that while she and her family were familiar with South Africa's high crime levels and often tried to ""not let it get us under"", this latest attack ""was the straw that broke the camel's back"".
Even though her family were eager to embrace Trump's offer when it was first announced, the mother-of-three told the BBC that the decision to leave ""was very difficult because you're... leaving a whole way of life"".
Asked whether it was unfair that Afrikaners were being granted refugee status at a time when the US was cracking down on refugees and asylum seekers from everywhere else in the world, Ms Steenkamp said she ""completely disagreed"". 
She pointed to assaults on farmers, saying there was a ""hatred that seems to go with these attacks"".
""Any farmer that has gone through that [kind of] attack and is now wanting to flee, I think should be treated as a refugee because they are fleeing from a government that will not even admit that these things are happening,"" she said.
Afrikaners make up about half of South Africa's white community
Sam BusÃ , 60, is another white South African who has applied for the refugee programme.
She is the founder of Amerikaners, a platform aimed at providing information to white South Africans interested in the US resettlement offer.
While Ms BusÃ , who is of English, not Afrikaner, descent, and her three sons have submitted their applications, they have not been interviewed yet. 
While it was initially believed that the executive order, vague in its original wording, only applied to white Afrikaners, Ms BusÃ  said it ""clearly is targeting white South Africans"".
On Monday, the US embassy in South Africa released a statement clarifying the criteria for those applying for resettlement, which said applicants need to be:
Of South African nationality
Afrikaner or from a racial minority
Able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future
Responding to the criticism that they were not genuine refugees, Ms BusÃ  said: ""When someone strips away your hope for the future, even though you're not in a warzone... someone ripping away your dreams and hope for the future, that is very dramatic. It's a mental anguish and emotional abuse in a sense.""
PODCAST: Are white Afrikaners really being targeted in South Africa?
What's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?
Is it checkmate for South Africa after Trump threats?
But Dr Piet Croucamp, an associate professor in political studies at South Africa's North West University, disagreed, echoing the view that those taking up this offer were not refugees as ""South Africa does not persecute people"".
Rather, he speculated that it may be those who have been victims of a crime and ""could define their existence as an unsecure one"".
Dr Croucamp, who is an Afrikaner, said that while he did not expect a significant number of white South Africans to follow suit, there would always be ""opportunistic"" people taking advantage of the situation.
""This is a small group of people leaving â the vast majority of Afrikaners are going nowhere and they have expressed themselves. Even the right-wing Afrikanersâ¦ [like] AfriForum and Solidarity have said they are not going anywhere. So even within Afrikaner circles, this is a small group of people,"" he said.
Despite their criticism of the government and its race-based policies, prominent Afrikaner lobby groups AfriForum and the Solidarity Movement have both reiterated their intention to remain in South Africa.
AfriForum said that while the government was to blame for the departure of the group granted refugee status, they would stay and continue their ""efforts to help create a future for Afrikaners here at the southern tip of Africa"".
This is a view with which Mr Janse van Vuuren agreed.
""While some may choose to leave as refugees, the majority of us are here to stay, working together to build a better future for all in South Africa.""

Russia's delegation will instead be headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, according to the Kremlin statement.
Zelensky had previously said he would attend the talks and meet Putin in person if the Russian president agreed, and said he would do everything he could to ensure the face-to-face meeting took place.
US President Donald Trump will also not be attending, according to media reports, despite previously hinting he would if Putin were there.
The talks are scheduled for 10:00 local time (08:00 BST) in Istanbul's Dolmabahce Palace and will be closed to the press, Russian news agency TASS reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.
Zelensky will be in the Turkish capital Ankara on Thursday to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said he would attend direct talks in Istanbul with Russia, but only if Putin also attended.
""I am waiting to see who will come from Russia, and then I will decide which steps Ukraine should take. So far, the signals from them in the media are unconvincing,"" he said in his nightly video address on Wednesday.
Putin and Zelensky have not met in person since December 2019. Russia and Ukraine last held direct negotiations in March 2022 in Istanbul, shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbour.
Fighting has raged in Ukraine since then. Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control over the past year, mostly in the east of Ukraine.
Beginning of the end? Ukraine's front-line soldiers eye Russia talks with hope
On Sunday Putin called for direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkey's largest city ""without pre-conditions"". Zelensky then announced he would go in person and expected the Russian president to travel as well.
Putin's suggestion of direct talks in Istanbul followed Western powers' call for a 30-day ceasefire, after European leaders met in Kyiv on Saturday.
After Trump called for Ukraine to accept the offer on Sunday, Zelensky said he would travel there himself.
""There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in TÃ¼rkiye on Thursday. Personally,"" Zelensky wrote in a social media post.
Earlier on Wednesday, Trump had floated the possibility of joining the meeting himself if Putin did.
The US president, who is currently in Qatar, told reporters he did not know if his Russian counterpart would attend ""if I'm not there"".
""I know he would like me to be there, and that's a possibility. If we could end the war, I'd be thinking about that,"" Trump said.
In a phone call with Putin on Wednesday, Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva reportedly asked his Russian counterpart to attend the talks and congratulated him on proposing them. 
The US is expected to send a high-level delegation to the talks. 
The country's top diplomat, Marco Rubio, arrived in Turkey on Wednesday, where he will meet Nato foreign ministers on Thursday. 
Ahead of that meeting, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he met Rubio on Wednesday evening. Sybiha said he had reaffirmed Ukraine's commitment to US peace efforts, and called on Russia to ""reciprocate Ukraine's constructive steps"". 
Rubio plans to travel onwards to Istanbul on Friday, where the State Department says he will attend talks with European counterparts to discuss the war in Ukraine.
Arriving at his hotel in Antalya on Wednesday, Rubio did not answer when the BBC asked him if Putin would be coming to Turkey.
Since returning to the White House, President Trump has sought to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.
He ended a years-long Western boycott of Russia's leader by speaking to Putin over the phone in February, and his envoy Steve Witkoff has met Vladimir Putin for talks in Moscow.
Trump has previously said Russia and Ukraine were ""very close to a deal"". 
On Sunday, when Putin proposed the direct talks, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: ""A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!"""

In his eagerness to accept a plane from Qatar, Donald Trump has achieved a remarkable feat, uniting many partisans across America's bitter political divide.
The problem for the White House is that unity is happening in opposition to it. 
Predictably, Trump's opponents in the Democratic Party slammed the president after he indicated he would accept a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family.
More noteworthy â and potentially more troubling for the president â is that some of his strongest supporters also have serious reservations about the deal, even as it's yet to be finalised.
Maga influencers have described the move as a ""bribe"", grift, or an example of the high-level corruption that Trump himself has consistently promised to root out.
The Qatari royal family plans to give the luxury Boeing 747-8, estimated to be worth $400m (Â£300m), to the US Department of Defence to be used as part of a fleet of planes dubbed Air Force One â the president's official mode of air travel.
The current fleet includes two 747-200 jets which have been in use since 1990, along with several smaller and somewhat secretive 757s, external.
The White House says that the new plane â which could require years and millions of dollars to refit and upgrade â will be transferred to Trump's presidential library at the end of his term.
The Democratic National Committee flew its own aircraft over Trump's Florida resort on Wednesday, towing a mocking banner reading ""Qatar-a-Lago""
After the news broke on Sunday, the backlash was fierce and immediate.
""I think the technical term is 'skeezy',"" deadpanned conservative Daily Wire commentator Ben Shapiro on his podcast.
""Qatar is not allegedly giving President Trump a $400m jet out of the goodness of their sweet little hearts,"" he said. ""They try to stuff money into pockets in totally bipartisan fashion.""
He and others pointed to allegations that Qatar has funnelled money into terrorist groups â allegations the country has denied â and called Qataris ""the world's largest proponents of terrorism on an international scale.""
Laura Loomer, the conspiracy-spreading social media influencer who agitates for sackings of top White House officials deemed insufficiently loyal, interrupted her steady stream of pro-Trump messaging to criticise the move.
Although she said she still supports the president, she called the plane deal ""a stain"" and posted a cartoon of the Trojan Horse, redrawn as a plane and filled with armed Islamist militants.
Trump found little support for the plan in more mainstream outlets as well.
The New York Post, which usually can be counted on to back much of the populist Maga agenda, ran a blunt editorial: ""Qatar's 'Palace in the Sky' jet is NOT a 'free gift' - and Trump shouldn't accept it as one.""
And Mark Levin, a consistent cheerleader of the president on Fox News and his radio talk show, posted on X accusing Qatar of being a ""terror state"" and wrote: ""Their jet and all the other things they are buying in our country does not provide them with the cover they seek"".
During his first term, Trump himself accused Qatar of funding terror groups.
When contacted by the BBC, the Qatari embassy in Washington pointed to an interview Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani gave CNN about the plane. 
""It is a government-to-government transaction. It has nothing to do with personal relationships - neither on the US side, nor the Qatari side. It's between the two defence ministries,"" he said. 
""Why would we buy influence in the United States?"" he added, arguing Qatar has ""always been a reliable and trusted partner. This is not a one-way relationship.""
Is Trump allowed to accept a $400m luxury plane as a gift?
In response to criticism of the deal, the White House has doubled down. Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the administration was ""committed to full transparency"".
""Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,"" she said.

Although there has been nothing offered in exchange for the plane, many commentators said it would be naÃ¯ve to expect that that Qatari royal family would hand out such a large item with no strings attached.
""They very obviously see that if you reward Donald Trump with gifts, that may pay off down the road,"" Doug Heye, a political strategist and former communications director for the Republican National Committee, told the BBC. ""Flattery gets you somewhere with Donald Trump, and we've seen that time and time again.""
The US Constitution includes a clause preventing officials from accepting ""any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""
But the White House has pointed out that, at least to begin with, the plane is being gifted to the US government.  
Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly investigated the legality of the deal and determined that because there are no explicit conditions attached, it would not amount to a bribe.
Conservatives and others were quick to point out that Bondi was registered as a lobbyist for Qatar prior to joining Trump's cabinet, at some points earning up to $115,0000 (Â£87,000) a month from her work for the Qatari government.
The Trump Organisation also continues to maintain links to Qatar and last month announced a deal to build a luxury golf resort in the country. 
Attorney General Pam Bondi is a former lobbyist
During a news conference at the White House on Tuesday the president berated a reporter who raised questions about the ethics of the transaction.
""What do you say to people who view that luxury jet as a personal gift to you?"" asked ABC reporter Rachel Scott.
""You should be embarrassed asking that question,"" Trump replied, after using his standard ""fake news"" jibe.
""They're giving us a free jet,"" the president said. ""I could say 'No, no, no, don't give us, I want to pay you a billion or 400 million'â¦ or I could say 'thank you very much'.""
On Truth Social, the president later reposted several messages pointing out that the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France, and wrote late Tuesday: ""The Boeing 747 is being given to the United States Air Force/Department of Defense, NOT TO ME!""
""Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,"" he wrote.
However even some within Trump's Republican Party were expressing concern.
""I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety, whether it's improper or not,"" Rand Paul, Republican senator from Kentucky, told Fox News.
""I wonder if our ability to judge [Qatar's] human rights record will be clouded by the fact of this large gift,"" Paul said. 
Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said accepting the gift would pose ""significant espionage and surveillance problems"". 
Trump did find some support within his party. ""Free is good. You know, we don't have a lot of money right now to buy things like that,"" Sen Tommy Tuberville told CNN.
Doug Heye, the Republican strategist, suggested that the deal might not hurt Trump's popularity with his base in the long term.
""Trump has been able for years now to turn scandals that would otherwise be debilitating for other politicians into things that we forget,"" he said. ""He's very skilled at that."""
421,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3v5r1erdpgo,2025-05-14 23:48:46,"Why India could not stop IMF bailout to Pakistan,","Indian paramilitary soldiers stand guard in Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir 
Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1bn (Â£756m) bailout to Pakistan â a move that drew sharp disapproval from India as military hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared, before a US-led ceasefire was unexpectedly declared.
Despite India's protests, the IMF board approved the second instalment of a $7bn loan, saying Islamabad had demonstrated strong programme implementation leading to a continuing economic recovery in Pakistan.
It also said the fund would continue to support Pakistan's efforts in building economic resilience to ""climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters"", providing further access of around $1.4bn in funding in the future. 
In a strongly worded statement, external India raised concerns over the decision, citing two reasons.
Delhi questioned the ""efficacy"" of such bailouts or the lack thereof, given Pakistan's ""poor track record"" in implementing reform measures. But more importantly it flagged the possibility of these funds being used for ""state-sponsored cross-border terrorism"" â a charge Islamabad has repeatedly denied - and said the IMF was exposing itself and its donors to ""reputational risks"" and making a ""mockery of global values"".
The IMF did not respond to the BBC's request for a comment on the Indian stance.
Even Pakistani experts argue that there's some merit to Delhi's first argument. Pakistan has been prone to persiste
ntly seeking the IMF's help â getting bailed out 24 times since 1958 â without undertaking meaningful reforms to improve public governance.
""Going to the IMF is like going to the ICU [intensive care unit]. If a patient goes 24 or 25 times to the ICU then there are structural challenges and concerns that need to be dealt with,"" Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, told the BBC.
As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited
But addressing Delhi's other concerns â that the IMF was ""rewarding continued sponsorship of cross-border terrorism"" thereby sending a ""dangerous message to the global community"" â is far more complex, and perhaps explains why India wasn't able to exert pressure to stall the bailout.
India's decision to try to prevent the next tranche of the bailout to Islamabad was more about optics then, rather than a desire for any tangible outcome, say experts. As per the country's own observations, the fund had limited ability to do something about the loan, and was ""circumscribed by procedural and technical formalities"".
As one of the 25 members of the IMF board, India's influence at the fund is limited. It represents a four-country group including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. Pakistan is part of the Central Asia group, represented by Iran.
Unlike the United Nations' one-country-one-vote system, the voting rights of IMF board members are based on a country's economic size and its contributions â a system which has increasingly faced criticism for favouring richer Western countries over developing economies.
For example, the US has the biggest voting share - at 16.49% - while India holds just 2.6%. Besides, most IMF decisions are made not by a formal vote, but by consensus, where voting against a proposal is not an option. In case a member is strictly not agreeable to a proposal they can abstain & register their dissent, what India did in this case.
""This shows how vested interests of powerful countries can influence decisions,"" an economist who didn't want to speak on the record told the BBC.
Addressing this imbalance was a key proposal in the reforms mooted for the IMF and other multilateral lenders during India's G20 presidency in 2023.
In their report, former Indian bureaucrat NK Singh and former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers recommended breaking the link between IMF voting rights and financial contributions to ensure fairer representation for both the ""Global North"" and the ""Global South"". But there has been no progress so far on implementing these recommendations.
Furthermore, recent changes in the IMF's own rules about funding countries in conflict add more complexity to the issue. A $15.6bn loan by the fund to Ukraine in 2023 was the first of its kind by the IMF to a country at war.
""It bent its own rules to give an enormous lending package to Ukraine - which means it cannot use that excuse to shut down an already-arranged loan to Pakistan,"" Mihir Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) think tank in Delhi told the BBC.
Reforms to the IMF's voting structure were discussed during India's G20 presidency in 2023
If India really wants to address its grievances,  the right forum to present them would be the United Nations FATF (Financial Action Task Force), says Mr Haqqani. 
The FATF looks at issues of combating terror finance and decides whether countries need to be placed on grey or black lists that prevent them from accessing funds from bodies like the IMF or the World Bank.
""Grandstanding at the IMF cannot and did not work,"" said Mr Haqqani. ""If a country is on that [FATF] list it will then face challenges in getting a loan from the IMF â as has happened with Pakistan earlier.""
As things stand though, Pakistan was officially removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list in 2022.
Separately, experts also caution that India's calls to overhaul the IMF's funding processes and veto powers could be a double-edged sword.
Such reforms ""would inevitably give Beijing [rather than Delhi] more power"", said Mr Sharma.
Mr Haqqani agrees. India should be wary of using ""bilateral disputes at multilateral fora"", he said, adding that India has historically been at the receiving end of being vetoed out by China in such places.
He points to instances of Beijing blocking ADB (Asian Development Bank) loans sought by India for the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, citing border disputes between the two countries in the region.

The newly elected Carney told Sky News, external that the UK's invitation earlier this year did not help Canadians, who were facing repeat comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state. 
""To be frank, [Canadians] weren't impressed by that gesture... given the circumstance,"" he said. ""It was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty.""
Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer invited Trump to come to the UK for a visit during a meeting at the White House in February.
Asked whether the invitation was ""appropriate"", Carney said that was a decision for the government of the UK and Buckingham Palace.
""I leave the diplomacy to the UK government,"" he said.
The BBC has contacted Carney's office and No 10 for comment.
When reached by the BBC, Buckingham Palace said the issue was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and did not comment further. 
The criticism from Carney comes as the Canadians prepare to welcome King Charles III and Queen Camilla at the end of this month for a royal visit. 
During the Sky News interview, Carney said his invitation for the King - Canada's head of state -  to attend the opening of Canada's Parliament ""is not coincidental"".  
""It is also a reaffirming moment, will be a reaffirming,"" Carney said, saying issues around Canada's sovereignty ""have been accentuated by the president"".
During his visit, the King will also read the Speech from the Throne  - a function usually carried out by the governor general.
The last time this happened was in October 1977, external when Queen Elizabeth II read the speech for the second time in Canada's history. The first was in 1957.
Since returning to the White House, Trump has made repeated comments undermining Canada's sovereignty, including that the Canadian border is an ""artificially drawn line"".
Meanwhile, Carney has firmly said Canada is ""not for sale, ever"".
Carney - who said he would only meet the US president ""until we get the respect we deserve"" -  sat down with Trump in Washington DC last week to begin negotiations on a new trade and security relationship. 
During the visit, Trump repeated his 51st state comments. 
Pressed on that, Carney told Sky News that Trump has shifted his tone from ""expectation to a desire for that to happen"". 
""He also came from a place where he recognised that was not going to happen."""

Big plumes of smoke are visible on a screen that's providing a live feed from Ukrainian drones hovering over the outskirts of the eastern city of Pokrovsk, one of the most intense front lines in Ukraine.
A few seconds earlier, Ukrainian artillery strikes Russian positions, places where we'd seen Russian soldiers moving about as they try to advance towards a key road going into Pokrovsk.
At least one Russian soldier is injured, possibly dead after the strike.
It's chilling to watch the live footage. It drives home the bloody consequences of the war that Russia started, in which hundreds of thousands have so far been killed, a ""never-ending bloodbath"" as US President Donald Trump calls it.
We are in a rural house converted into a command centre for the 155th mechanised brigade of the Ukrainian army. It's a few miles from front-line artillery positions.
The scale of the devastation that we see on the screens, homes and buildings completely flattened, is far greater than what we saw six months ago.  
It is evidence of the fierce battle that has been fought over the past several months to defend Pokrovsk, a crucial transport hub in the Donetsk region.
This week, there's cautious optimism, even among sceptical soldiers who have witnessed hopes of a ceasefire being dashed over and over again, as diplomatic efforts from the US, Europe, Turkey and others have pushed Russia and Ukraine to direct talks for the first time in three years.
""I think something should happen since Russia was the first one to push for these talks. I mean since 2022, they have refused to go into any contact,"" says an officer who wants to be referred to with his call sign ""Kozak"".
""I want to believe this would be the beginning of the end of the war.
""But now I see, we have been successful in destroying their rear positions and their supply lines. Russia does not have the same strength and power it had at the beginning. So I think that something will happen."" 
Yurii (R) does not believe Russia will stop if Ukraine gives up territory now
Yurii, 37, used to work in a technology company before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. ""They (Russia and Ukraine) have to start talking. Us soldiers, we wish this war would end. But it's important to remember that we cannot stop it because we did not start it,"" he says.
He looks up at the screen and spots Russian soldiers moving again. He and his colleagues calculate the co-ordinates of their positions and pass them on to their artillery unit.
We drive from the command centre to the artillery position, on mud tracks running through a wide expanse of open fields. Clumps of mud fly in the air, our car slips and slides, as we move as fast as possible. The speed is a mitigation against strikes from drones, which have sharply increased fatalities for both Russia and Ukraine since they were deployed in large numbers in 2023.
And war technology keeps evolving. Now there's a new threat â drones equipped with a real fibre optic cable which unrolls as they fly. ""We cannot detect them or neutralise them, so there are probably a lot more drones in the area right now than we know,"" says Yurii.
As we drive into the artillery position hidden under trees and bushes, soldiers are already loading the gun. It's a French made self-propelled artillery gun called the ""Caesar"". Scores have been deployed in Ukraine since the start of the war, and France has been trying to ramp up production.
France has been sending dozens of Caesar self-propelled artillery guns to Ukraine since 2022
""I'm very impressed by its accuracy, and we can use a large range of ammunition. The most important thing is that bringing it into combat is very fast. It is much more effective than the old Soviet equipment I've used,"" says Kozak.
Ukrainian soldiers fire four rounds, each one emitting a deafening sound. From around us, we also hear the sound of incoming shells. The battle rages on.
""As you can hear, there is a wave of assaults from the enemy and we need a lot of ammunition to suppress that. We hope our international partners can give us as much ammunition as possible, because if we have to start choosing priority and non-priority targets then the enemy will be successful,"" says Kozak.
We ask the soldiers how they feel about suggestions that Ukraine will have to make concessions, that it might have to give up land to secure peace.
""It's painful to hear that. Even I want to go home to my family. My daughter is eight and I miss her so much. But we need to be strong. I don't believe that if we give up some territory, they will stop. In a couple of years, they will return and start over,"" says Yurii.
""A person who has not come here, who hasn't felt the consequences of Russian aggression, those armchair commentators say you can give up land and everything will be over. They will never understand how many brothers and friends we have lost. We shouldn't give up a single metre of our land,"" says Kozak.
The impact of three years of war can be seen everywhere across Ukraine
The cost Ukraine has paid to defend its land is visible everywhere, most acutely in the photos of smiling, young soldiers posted by the side of highways, on memorial walls in central city squares, and on rows and rows of freshly dug graves in the country.
Yana Melnikova lovingly buys her son's favourite treats - a cup of steaming hot chocolate and a chocolate roll.
Then she drives out to a cemetery in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, and places them neatly by 22-year-old Vladislav's grave. She and her daughter, 13-year-old Nicole, wipe the grave with wet tissues. Before long, they break down inconsolably into each other's arms.
Vladislav was a drone operator with the Ukrainian military. He was killed in combat in a Russian strike on 21 February this year.
For Yana, news of direct talks resuming bring no hope.
""It seems to me that this war is eternal. Of course, I hope they will find a solution. Because people are dying here and there (in Russia). But Putin is greedy. His hunger for our land is insatiable,"" says Yana.
Yana, whose son was killed earlier this year, says she cannot live in land taken over by Russia
Parts of the Zaporizhzhia region are currently occupied by Russia, the front line less than 40 miles from the city. But Russia has on more than one occasion demanded control of the full regions of Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, Donetsk and Kherson as part of any peace deal.
""No way. I want to live in Ukraine, not Russia. We have seen what they do under occupation, what they did in places like Bucha â their cruelty and torture,"" says Yana. ""Can you imagine, they've not even spared this graveyard,"" she adds, pointing to a big crater nearby where a bomb exploded some months ago.
Tears rolling down her eyes, she adds: ""I hope my child did not die for nothing. That there will still be a victory and all of Ukraine will become free.""

At least 80 people have been killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza, hospitals and first responders say.
The Indonesian hospital said 22 children and 15 women were among 50 people who died when several homes in the northern Jabalia area were hit overnight. Nearby al-Awda hospital said it had received the bodies of another nine people, seven of them children.
The Israeli military said it struck Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters in the north. It had warned residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas to evacuate on Tuesday after rockets were launched into Israel.
It came as the UN's humanitarian chief urged members of the UN Security Council to take action to ""prevent genocide"" in Gaza.
Speaking at a meeting in New York on Tuesday, Tom Fletcher accused Israel of ""deliberately and unashamedly imposing inhumane conditions on civilians"".
He also called on Israel to lift its 10-week blockade on Gaza and criticised the Israeli-US plan to take over the distribution of humanitarian aid by using private companies, saying it was a ""fig leaf for further violence and displacement"" of Palestinians.
Israel's envoy to the UN, Danny Danon, said the accusations were ""baseless and outrageous"".
He insisted the existing system for aid was ""broken"" because it was being used to help Hamas's war effort - an allegation both the UN and the armed group have denied.
Residents of Jabalia town and its refugee camp reported hearing multiple explosions overnight, and videos shared by activists showed flames lighting up the sky.
One video shared online showed at least 14 bodies wrapped in blankets and white shrouds on the floor of the Indonesian hospital.
Hadi Moqbel, 42, said several members of his family were killed.
""They fired two rockets, they told us the house of Moqbel [had been hit],"" he told Reuters news agency as he clambered over the destroyed building.
""We came running, we saw body parts on the ground, children killed, [a] woman killed and a baby killed... He was two months old.""
The director of al-Awda hospital said in an audio message that it was struggling to deal with the 52 injured people brought there for treatment after the strikes because of the shortages of medical supplies and fuel for its electricity generators, with the latter forcing the closure of several departments.
The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported that 80 people had been killed in Israeli strikes across the territory since dawn, including 59 in the north.
The Israeli military said in a statement that it ""struck Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists"" in northern Gaza overnight. It added that ""numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians"".
On Tuesday night, the military had issued what it described as a ""final warning"" to residents of Jabalia and neighbouring areas. It ordered them to evacuate immediately to Gaza City, saying Israeli forces would ""attack with great force any area from which rockets are launched"".
The military said three rockets launched from Gaza crossed into Israeli territory, triggering sirens in Israeli border communities and the town of Sderot. Two of the rockets were intercepted by the Israeli air force and the third fell in an open area, it added.
PIJ - an armed group that like its ally Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - said it launched the rockets in response to what it called ""Zionist massacres"".
On Wednesday afternoon, the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders for six parts of the northern Rimal neighbourhood of Gaza City, warning that there would be strikes ""due to Hamas's exploitation of civilian areas for terrorist activities"".
An infographic identified the affected areas as al-Shifa hospital, the Islamic University, and the al-Shati, Carmel, Mustafa Hafez and al-Furqan school complexes, and alleged that they contained Hamas command centres, structures and meeting points.
The areas are packed with tents housing thousands of displaced people.
Al-Shifa is also one of only 22 partially functional hospitals in Gaza. It was largely destroyed in a two-week raid by Israeli forces last year but has since reopened its emergency department.
Casualties from the strikes on Jabalia were brought to nearby Indonesian hospital
Israel cut off all deliveries of aid and other supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.
The UN says 20% of the 2.1 million population has been displaced again, and that 70% of Gaza is now either within Israeli military ""no-go"" zones or under evacuation orders.
Severe shortages of food and fuel have forced all UN-supported bakeries and more than 60% of the 180 community kitchens providing hot meals to shut down.
A UN-backed assessment released on Monday warned that the entire population was facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people facing starvation.
The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid because thousands of lorry loads entered during the ceasefire.
Palestinians are hoping Hamas's decision on Monday to release the last living Israeli-American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander, could pave the way for a possible new ceasefire deal with Israel and the end of the blockade.
Hamas said it freed Mr Alexander as a goodwill gesture to US President Donald Trump, who is visiting the Middle East this week.
On Wednesday morning, Trump told a summit of Gulf leaders in Riyadh that he was hopeful that more of the 58 hostages still being held by Hamas in Gaza would be freed.
""All hostages must be released as a stepping stone to peace,"" he said. ""I think that's going to be happening.""
At the same time, his special envoys Steve Witkoff and Adam Boehler participated in a new round of indirect talks in Doha along with officials from regional mediators Qatar and Egypt.
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also said he had a ""lengthy"" discussion with Witkoff by telephone ""on the issue of the hostages"".
More than 65 former hostages meanwhile signed a letter urging the Israeli government to seize a ""genuine opportunity to return to the negotiating table"" and secure the release of all the hostages. ""Please do not walk away until a comprehensive deal is signed,"" they said.
Israeli 'bunker buster' bombs used in Gaza hospital strike, experts say
Netanyahu has said Israel is planning to expand its military offensive in Gaza and that nothing will stop the war.
He told injured reservist soldiers on Monday that Israeli forces would go into the territory in the coming days ""with full force to complete the operation"" to destroy Hamas.
""There will be no situation where we stop the war. A temporary ceasefire might happen, but we are going all the way,"" he added.
Hamas has refused to release the remaining hostages unless Israel agrees to a permanent ceasefire and withdraws from Gaza.
On Tuesday, a massive Israeli air strike on the European hospital's compound in Khan Younis killed at least 28 people, according to local officials.
The Israeli military described it as ""a precise strike on Hamas terrorists who were operating in a command-and-control centre"" underneath the hospital.
Israeli media reports said the target was Mohammed Sinwar, who is believed to have become the top Hamas leader in Gaza after his brother Yahya was killed by Israeli forces last October.
Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,928 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,799 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

A judge in the US state of Wisconsin has been charged for allegedly helping a Mexican man evade immigration officials through a back door during an arrest attempt.
Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested in April. Now a federal grand jury has approved the two charges against her, which could see the judge face a prison term.
It marks a further escalation of Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on immigration, and has provoked an outcry from Democrats, who accuse the Trump administration of attacking the judicial system.
Judge Dugan's defence lawyers argue that she is shielded from prosecution by a legal immunity that protects judges carrying out official acts. 
In a motion to dismiss the case filed on Wednesday, the judge's legal team noted that she ""is no ordinary criminal defendant"".
On 18 April, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national facing three misdemeanour battery counts, appeared in the Milwaukee court for a scheduled hearing.
Six officers from the FBI, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and the Drug Enforcement Agency were at the court to arrest him. 
According to an FBI affidavit, the Judge Dugan became ""visibly angry commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers"" when she learned of their presence.
After an argument in the hallway over the type of arrest warrant that had been issued, Judge Dugan told the officers to report to the chief judge, and while they were there, the affidavit says, she ushered Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer to a side door meant for jury members.
But they were seen by two agents.
Flores-Ruiz, who authorities say had previously been deported from the US in 2013, managed to exit the courthouse but was arrested just minutes later after a short foot chase.
Judge Dugan's defence lawyers argued on Wednesday that even if she had taken the actions outlined by prosecutors, ""these plainly were judicial acts for which she has absolute immunity from criminal persecution.""
""Judges are empowered to maintain control over their courtrooms specifically and the courthouse generally.""
Her motion cites Trump's landmark Supreme Court case, in which the justices ruled that presidents are immune from criminal prosecutions related to their official acts. She cites the case to argue that ""subjective motivations are irrelevant to immunity"".
At the time of her arrest, FBI director Kash Patel accused the judge of ""intentionally misdirecting"" immigration agents away from Flores-Ruiz, thus creating an ""increased danger to the public"".
The presence of immigration officials at US courthouses has sparked fierce debate, largely along partisan lines.
Republicans have generally welcomed the move, saying that no one should be above the law. 
Democrats, on the other hand, condemned the decision to arrest the judge, with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, calling it the Trump administrationâs âattempt to undermine our judiciary at every level.â
Wisconsin's supreme court suspended Judge Dugan from the bench in late April, saying the move was necessary to preserve public confidence in the judiciary.
She has been charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest, and faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted on both charges.
Judge Dugan was released on her own recognisance, pending a hearing on Thursday when she is expected to enter a plea.
The day before her arrest, a former judge in New Mexico was taken into custody accused of harbouring an alleged Venezuelan gang member in his home.
Under the US judicial system, a federal grand jury usually comprises 16 to 23 members of the public. It is set up by a prosecutor to determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue a prosecution, and in this case, it decided that the charges should go ahead."

Donald Trump has said his administration is now exploring the possibility of normalising relations with Syria - his comments coming shortly after he met Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose forces ended the decades-long dictatorship of the Assad family.
The extraordinary encounter, unthinkable just months ago, was short but significant.
""I think he has got the potential,"" Trump remarked after his meeting in Riyadh, 37 minutes long, with the former Syrian fighter formerly linked to al-Qaeda.  
The $10m US bounty on his head was only lifted in December.
Video footage of their conversation in a lavish Saudi royal palace showed some initial awkwardness as they spoke through a translator. 
A beaming Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, sat next to them. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan joined them by telephone.
Trump acknowledged it was these two leaders who had convinced him to also lift the US's punishing Syria sanctions. 
His sudden announcement on Tuesday night at a major US-Saudi investment forum in Riyadh won him a standing ovation. It was a volte-face after his many previous posts on social media that the US had ""no interest in Syria"".
""Tough guy, very strong past,"" is how Trump later described Sharaa to journalists travelling with his high-powered American delegation on his first official four-day tour.
It was a very Trump gloss about Sharaa's old links to al-Qaeda. His Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), was al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria until he severed ties in 2016. HTS is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US and UK.
Since assuming power in December, Sharaa has been wearing Western business suits and trying to present himself as a president for all Syrians.
""It's a new light at the end of this tunnel,"" exclaimed Hind Kabawat, minister of social affairs and labour, in the interim government. 
She told the BBC's Newshour programme they had been calling for sanctions relief ever since their ""Liberation Day"".
The US decision sparked celebrations across a county where 90% of Syrians are said to be living in poverty, after more than a decade of civil war and profound suffering.
Removing restrictions which cut Syria off from the international financial system will enable greater engagement by aid agencies and encourage foreign investment and trade.

""We are the North Korea of the Middle East,"" a hotel receptionist in Damascus told me last December when I asked for another electronic hotel key. 
He tearfully lamented that ""we don't have enough cards, we have shortages of everything"".
It may also help convince some of the millions of Syrians living in exile to think more seriously about returning home. And it could help a fledgling government to pay salaries, begin to rebuild, and address the growing discontent over the privations of daily life.
But dismantling the vast web of sanctions now strangling Syria will take time. 
""Some sanctions can be removed immediately using presidential waivers,"" commented Dina Esfandiary of Bloomberg Economics.
""But lifting the multi-layered sanctions won't be easy and will require real commitment by the Trump administration.""
I remember travelling to Tehran in the wake of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the Obama administration's commitment to ease sanctions there. 
At the news conference with the visiting EU's high representative for foreign policy, Iranian journalists kept asking, with palpable anguish, why it was still impossible for them even to open a bank account.
Syria's new friends, including regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, now positioning themselves to shape the new Syria, will need to ensure Trump and his team stay interested.
But he's made it clear he expects something in return if there is to be a full normalisation of relations. The first item on his list is ""join the Abraham Accords"".
The US president regards this process of normalisation with Israel, which several Arab states including the United Arab Emirates has joined, as one of his foreign policy achievements in his  first term.
Sharaa, praised by his friends as pragmatic, has already signalled that he understands the importance of building a working relationship with his neighbour, even though Israel continues to bomb what it calls ""terrorist targets"" â air bases, military installations and weapons depots â insisting they could ""fall into the wrong hands"".
Last month, the Syrian leader reportedly told a visiting US congressman, Cory Mills, that Syria was prepared to normalise ties with Israel and join the Abraham Accords under ""the right conditions"".
Israeli media have reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had urged President Trump not to lift sanctions. He remains suspicious of Sharaa and his HTS forces, as well other groups which include foreign fighters in their ranks.
Removing foreign fighters is another of Washington's demands; it's one of the very many challenges now facing Syria's leader.
President Trump hailed this moment as ""a chance at greatness"". Millions of Syrians just welcome a greater chance that their lives will finally start changing for the better."

A hotline supposed to connect the Pentagon with local air traffic controllers in Washington DC has been ""inoperable"" since 2022, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) official has testified. 
At a Senate hearing on Wednesday, FAA officials said they only learned of the problem this month after controllers at Ronald Reagan national airport had to wave off two flights attempting to land because of a nearby US Army helicopter.
That incident came just a week after a nearby army aviation unit said it would resume training flights. 
Those flights were paused following a January crash between a military helicopter and passenger plane at the airport  that left 67 dead. 
Deputy air traffic control head Franklin McIntosh told senators that the hotline was operated by the defence department and that his agency had been unaware of any problems. 
It is believed to have been functioning properly before March 2022. 
""We're insisting that line be fixed before we resume any operations out of the Pentagon,"" Mr McIntosh added.  
Additionally, he said that, after the aborted landing incident, officials mulled mandating that military flights in the area needed to be cleared by the FAA before taking off. 
Before that could take place, the commander of the 12th Aviation Battalion - which ferries senior Pentagon officials around Washington DC - announced on 5 May that the unit was again pausing flights. 
The 29 January midair crash starkly highlighted concerns about coordination in the congested skies near Washington. 
All 64 people aboard the American Airlines-operated plane died, as well as three crew members of Blackhawk Helicopter which had taken off from Fort Belvoir in Virginia on a training mission. 
In the more recent incidents earlier this month, two aircraft from Delta and Republic Airways were told by air traffic controllers to perform ""go-arounds"" because of an approaching Army helicopter, similar to the one that had been involved in the crash. 
The FAA, along with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the recent near-misses. 
The NTSB had previously faulted the FAA for failing to take action despite 85 close calls near Reagan airport in the three-years before the January crash. 
Between 2011 and 2024, planes received alerts to take evasive actions at a rate of about one per week, NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said in March. 
The FAA is also carrying out a review of helicopter traffic at high-risk airports around the country, including Harry Reid Airport in Las Vegas."

Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion more than three years ago. Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control over the past year, mostly in the east of Ukraine.
Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine.
In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, enveloping and overwhelming villages and towns.
It is trying to capture the rest of the region, known as the Donbas, according to US-based analysts at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), but the front line has barely moved for two years.
Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time - with at least 45,000 Russian troops killed in the past year alone. 
Ukrainian military intelligence says about 620,000 Russian soldiers are operating in Ukraine and Kursk. Kyiv believes thousands of troops have entered Ukraine since the start of the year.
Fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops intensified in recent weeks, with  assaults on the front line up by about 30%, according to Ukrainian military chiefs, who believed they were part of a spring offensive by Russia.
Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?
Until now Russian forces have been advancing slowly north and west of Donetsk, towards the city of Pokrovsk, and have recently been closing a Ukrainian pocket along the front line south west of Toretsk, according to experts at the ISW.
The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months, but analysts say innovative tactics by Ukrainian forces, combining the use of drones and ground forces, have inflicted significant losses of troops and equipment and slowed the offensive.
It has taken a year for Russia's troops to advance about 40km (25 miles). Ukraine was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, in February 2024 after months of fighting.
In addition to its operation on the eastern front, Russia began what the ISW describes as its ""subordinate main effort"" when it crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, in May 2024. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled.
The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress which was resolved in April 2024.
Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and, even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery.
Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia had already seized the southern peninsula of Crimea in February 2014 before annexing it soon afterwards.
US President Donald Trump has said it is unlikely Ukraine will return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said ""some of that land will come back"".
In an interview with the Guardian, published on 11 February,, external Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Ukraine in Russia's western Kursk region in recent months as part of a peace deal.
Ukraine seized control of part of the region in a surprise attack launched across the border by Ukrainian troops in August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region.
After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages but Russia has since reclaimed much of that territory.
Fighting is continuing in the region more than a week after Moscow said it had pushed Ukrainian troops out. Ukraine says its forces are still active there and have continued drone, air and artillery strikes in the area - particularly around the village of Tetkino.
The US, Ukraine's strongest military ally, has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiation since Trump took office at the start of the year. 
However, Zelensky and Trump have repeatedly clashed and tensions have been high since a heated confrontation at the White House in February during which Trump accused Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"" and chided him for not starting peace talks with Russia earlier.
By contrast, the US president has made efforts to improve relations with Moscow, although he did say he was ""very angry"" with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at the end of March after ceasefire talks between US and Russian officials stalled.
On 30 April the US and Ukraine signed a long-discussed deal to share profits from the future sale of Ukraine's mineral and energy reserves.
The deal aims to provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine's defence and reconstruction - as well as to address Washington's concerns over the amount of aid it has already contributed.
It will also see the establishment of an investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from the war.
After the deal was signed US Vice-President JD Vance said the war was ""not going to end any time soon"" and that the question facing the US administration now was how it could help Russia and Ukraine ""find middle ground"" to end the conflict.
Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022.
Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv.
Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol.
But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition.
Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance.
By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson.
Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months - military experts estimate between 165,000 and 235,000 Russian service personnel have been killed since the invasion.
Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be an under-estimate.

Mali's military junta has dissolved all political parties in the country amid a growing crackdown on dissent since the army seized power.
""All meetings of members of political parties and organisations of a political character are dissolved across the national territory,"" according to a presidential decree read out on state TV on Tuesday.
It was signed by military leader Assimi GoÃ¯ta, who seized power after coups in 2020 and 2021 and is due to stay in power for at least another five years despite pledges to hold elections. 
The move is expected to spark fresh resistance by political parties who have been demanding the country returns to democratic rule.
Since last year,  the military authorities have intensified a crackdown on political activity. 
Last week, following a rare pro-democracy protest, two opposition leaders were abducted by armed men saying they were police officers. The authorities have not commented on the reported arrests.
A national conference organised by the regime - but boycotted by leading opposition parties - last month recommended naming Gen GoÃ¯ta as president until 2030. 
The move sparked condemnation from opposition figures and human rights groups. The junta originally committed to holding elections in February 2022.
The presidential decree warned Malians not to ignore the dissolution of political parties but did not outline any penalties.
It said that anyone working in a political or administrative role could ""continue their duties without party affiliation"". 
The order follows the suspension of all political activity - another recommendation from the national conference - which sparked uproar among the opposition. 
A coalition of a hundred parties had planned a protest against the transitional authorities last week but postponed it following the suspension of political activities.
Opposition leaders have condemned the dissolution of political parties.
""No matter how hard they try to make you invisible, your value doesn't depend on their recognition,"" Nouhoum Togo, president of the Union for the Safeguarding of the Republic (USR) party, posted on social media. 
Moussa Mara, a former prime minister and opposition figure, described the junta's restrictions as dealing ""a severe blow to the reconciliation efforts initiated last year"".
Analyst Ulf Laessing said the country's military leaders were trying to ""break with old elites who had been in charge since independence and were seen as very close to former colonial power France"".
Since taking power, the junta leader has formed an alliance with coup leaders in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, pivoting the region towards Russia after drastically reducing ties with former colonial power France.
Gen GoÃ¯ta has also withdrawn Mali from the regional grouping Ecowas over its demands to restore democratic rule. Burkina Faso and Niger have also left the grouping.

A man who caused the deaths of two teenage girls whilst driving at nearly twice the speed limit has been sentenced to seven years in prison.
Kiea McCann, 17, and her best friend, 16-year-old Dlava Mohammed, died when the car they were travelling in struck a tree at Legnakelly, near Clones, on 31 July 2023.
Anthony McGinn, 61, with an address at Drumloo, Newbliss, County Monaghan, previously admitted dangerous driving causing the deaths of the teenagers.
Speaking after the sentencing, Kiea's mum, Teresa, said: ""Seven years, that's the justice here. Two beautiful girls. This is what we got today.
""There is no justice for this. My child's life is gone and never coming back.""
The girls were on their way to a school ball at the Westenra Arms Hotel in Monaghan town when the crash happened.
Senior Investigating Officer Ann-Marie Lardner said An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) ""not only supports"" the families of the two teenage girls, but ""stands united in grief"" following the death of Garda Kevin Flatley from a collision on Sunday.
""They had their entire lives and bright futures in front of them, they were killed in a devastating road traffic collision and never came home,"" Insp Lardner said.
""They are just three of the 418 people killed on our roads since the start of 2023.
""An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and all our road safety partners continue to repeat... speeding kills.""
Kiea McCann's mother held up a picture of her daughter as they left court
McGinn was a friend of Ms McCann's family and had offered to drive the girls to the event.
He also pleaded guilty to causing serious bodily harm to Ms Mohammed's sister, Avin, who was one of two other teenagers in the car at the time of the collision.
In handing down the sentence, the judge noted that McGinn had been driving at 151km per hour (94mph) and had ignored the pleas of two passengers in the car to slow down.
He said that as a friend of the McCann family, he had been entrusted to drive the young people and by driving as he had, he had ""shown an extraordinary breach of that trust"".
He said McGinn's intention had been ""to drive at a grossly excessive speed"".
The judge added that he had shown a ""reckless disregard for the potential loss of life and serious injury"".
Anthony McGinn arriving at court on Wednesday
During a hearing last week, the court heard McGinn had been driving nearly double the 80 km per hour (50mph) speed limit in the moments leading up to the crash.
During proceedings, the court also heard that Ms McCann's father, Franky, had arrived at the scene of the crash and carried out CPR on both Kiea and Dlava. 
They were later both pronounced dead at the scene. 
The court was told that OisÃ­n Clerkin, who was a front seat passenger in the car, had asked Mr McGinn to slow down.
Ms Mohammed's family had moved to Ireland in 2018, having fled from Syria. 
In a victim impact statement, her father said they had moved to build their dreams; however, ""Dlava's dreams are now buried with her"".
Ms McCann was one of 11 children. 
Addressing McGinn in court last week, Franky McCann said: ""Because of the decision you made, you took our daughter from our lives and our hearts."""

Derek Wang says his American customers were wowed by his air fryer models - which are controlled via smartphones and can also bake, roast and grill.
But then on 2 April, Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs hit all Chinese goods entering the US, eventually reaching 145%  - and his clients asked him to pause production. 
""I tried to keep smiling through my anxiety for the sake of my 40 workers,"" he told the BBC. 
On Wednesday, as a deal to ease the trade war came into effect, Mr Wang said his US buyers were back on the phone.
Both countries still face some tariffs. There is at least a 30% tax on all Chinese goods entering the US and Beijing has kept a 10% levy on American goods coming into the country, down from 125%.
But this surprise agreement after a weekend of negotiations in Switzerland has given factories and businesses some breathing room.
""At this time, our US client is willing to pay for the tariffs. Of course, we had to bargain with them as they asked us to lower some of our costs,"" he said.

Derek Wang spent almost half a million dollars setting up his company 
Mr Wang, who studied engineering in Delaware in the US, spent three years helping develop the air fryer model. It cost him $500,000 to set up his company and he said the tariffs came as a shock.
""It felt like my parents were getting a divorce. China and US are the most important economic and cultural powers in the world. Their sudden separation would lead to a world that we cannot imagine. Tariffs as high as 145% would mean we have to say goodbye to one another.
But he adds, ""there's a saying in Chinese: good fortune comes out of bad"".
Mr Wang believes his ""good fortune"" is that this trade war has accelerated his plan to diversify away from doing business with America.
This is one of the reasons why Beijing believes it has the upper hand in its negotiations with Washington. China has choices and officials have been actively encouraging the country's firms to do more business in places like Africa, South America and South East Asia.
Many other Chinese businesses have also told the BBC that they are looking to diversify away from the US to reduce their reliance on the market - suggesting in the long-term there could be more of a separation between the US and China, rather than a divorce.
Tariffs meant that some factory orders were paused...
Donald Trump has suggested that he may speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping by the end of this week. The world's two largest economies will now enter talks after agreeing to a ceasefire in their economic war for 90 days.
Beijing has framed this deal as a win - not just for China but for all countries facing US tariffs.
But it has come at a cost.
A short walk through Shunde district - known as the ""capital of home appliances"" - presents a sobering assessment of a struggling manufacturing sector.
Factory workers use the cooler evenings in Foshan to let off a little steam. They spill out into every corner of the local park.
During the day they pack, mould and assemble nearly everything that you would find in your kitchen - from gas stoves and washing machines to kettles and fridges.
At night, after leaving work, one group line dances in one corner of the small park, while a heated basketball match takes place in another part.
Posters lining the walls of the streets tout ""stable work and easy"" jobs involving packing and screwing products for 30 days in a home appliance factory for 16 yuan an hour, to assembling air conditioning units for 20 yuan an hour.
But agents told us that several factories had stopped hiring, especially those linked to the US - some had even shut down parts of their production line.
... leaving workers struggling to find jobs
The BBC was told that several of these workers will sleep in the park to save money. Many of them travel to Foshan from their home towns, which can be hundreds of kilometres away.
Several nearby hostels offer rooms for 20 yuan a night, which can be at least an hour's pay. Many will want to pocket whatever they earn to send it back to their families.
This is the picture of China that President Trump's team have tried to present â one of sluggish growth, rising unemployment and a chronic housing crisis.
""We're not looking to hurt China,"" Mr Trump said after the trade agreement was announced, while adding that China was ""being hurt very badly"".
""They were closing up factories. They were having a lot of unrest, and they were very happy to be able to do something with us.""
This may be overstating Beijing's economic woes. This country is still leading the world when it comes to the production of electric vehicles and solar panels, and it is making significant headway in artificial intelligence technology.
Officials in China have also continued to stress this country can take the pain of an economic war. But it is being keenly felt by some on the frontline and that may be part of why Beijing has started talking to the US.
Chinese business owners say their confidence in the US has been shaken
This latest ""ceasefire"" has prompted a rush of orders between the two countries as businesses wonder if it can last.
He Ke, or HK to his American clients, has called his workers back from their home towns to restart his sofa business, Gongyuan Furniture.
It ground to a halt even before Mr Trump's tariffs hit 145%.
""We had a day off straightaway,"" said Mr He. ""Once the tariffs hit 50%, we had already come to a standstill. When they hit 145%, we certainly could not do business. It was just not possible.""
His production line with around 200 workers once took up all four floors of the building.
Since the Covid pandemic, he has only needed one floor and around 40 staff. But he still has the odd high-profile client â he claims Elon Musk sits on one of his sofas.


At a sofa company, production was halted and workers sent home when Trump's tariffs kicked in
Some workers have already returned and are lifting a soft chair onto a compressor machine to get it ready to box and ship.
Sewing machines hum in the background as workers stitch fabric into the right shape to cover memory foam cushions.
Mr He says he has seen many changes in Foshan since he started making sofas in 2013.
""We feel that the global economy is not good. The domestic economy has also been hit and this affects the life of people here. In the past, when we went out to spend money, we spent a lot of money. We did not think about whether the price was high or cheap. We will buy it as long as we like it. Now, when we want to buy a relatively expensive things, we have to think twice, because the money is not easy to earn.""
Like Mr Wang and his air fryers, Mr He also says he is looking at diversifying his sales away from the US, but he has hope that the world's two biggest economies can come to an agreement in the next 90 days.
""I am just a small businessman. But I do understand that the game between these two countries is temporary. I think if they want to survive with each other for a long time, they will definitely sit down and talk things over."""

Members of Peru's Congress had called for the no-confidence vote after the recent  kidnap and killing of 13 mine workers, which shocked the country.
AdrianzÃ©n's resignation is another blow to the embattled president, Dina Boluarte, who has seen her approval ratings plummet as crime rates in the country have soared.
The resignation of the prime minister - the third to serve under Boluarte - forces the president to replace her entire cabinet, adding to Peru's political upheaval.
Under Peru's constitution, all ministers have to step down if the prime minister quits.
While the president can rename the same people to the posts they resigned from, she can only do so once a new prime minister is in place.
The collapse of the cabinet comes at an already rocky time in Peruvian politics.
Shortly before Prime Minister AdrianzÃ©n announced his resignation, Boluarte had reshuffled her existing cabinet, announcing new ministers of finance, interior, and transport.
All three will now have to step down, just hours after being sworn in by the president.
The already low approval rating of President Boluarte - who was sworn in when the previous president, Pedro Castillo, was impeached - have fallen further as Peruvians grow increasingly impatient at what they say is her failure to tackle crime.
In recent months, hundreds of people have taken to the streets in protest at the growing problem of extortion, as gangs increasingly demand payments even from the smallest businesses, including transport workers.
Dressed in white, they demanded ""an immediate answer to combat extortion and targeted killings"".

President Cyril Ramaphosa has called a group of 59 white South Africans who have moved to the US to resettle ""cowards"", saying ""they'll be back soon"".
The group of Afrikaners arrived in the US on Monday after President Donald Trump granted them refugee status, saying they faced racial discrimination.
But Ramaphosa said those who wanted to leave were not happy with efforts to address the inequities of the apartheid past, terming their relocation a ""sad moment for them"". 
""As South Africans, we are resilient. We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems. When you run away you are a coward, and that's a real cowardly act,"" he added. 
Trump and his close ally, South Africa-born Elon Musk, have said there was a ""genocide"" of white farmers in South Africa - a claim that has been widely discredited.
The US has also accused the South African government of seizing land from white farmers without paying compensation.
More than 30 years after the end of decades of rule by South Africa's white minority, black farmers own only a small fraction of the country's best farmland, with the majority still in white hands, leading to anger over the slow pace of change.
In January President Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"".
But the government says no land has yet been seized under the act.
Racially charged row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink
What's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?
Trump has offered to resettle the white Afrikaners, descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, saying they were fleeing a ""terrible situation"" in South Africa.
Speaking on Monday at an agricultural exhibition in the Free State province, Ramaphosa said the Afrikaners were moving to the US because they were not ""favourably disposed"" to efforts aimed at addressing the country's challenges.  
""If you look at all national groups in our country, black and white, they've stayed in this country because it's our country and we must not run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems,"" Ramaphosa said.
""I can bet you that they will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa,"" he added. 
His ""coward"" remark angered some social media users, who condemned it as an insult to aggrieved white South Africans.
The group of Afrikaners were welcomed by top US officials who claimed they had been ""living under a shadow of violence and terror"" in South Africa. 
""Welcome to the land of the free,"" Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said as he received the South Africans who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday. 
Some held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls.
Earlier on Monday, President Ramaphosa told an Africa CEO forum in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, that he had recently told Trump during a phone call the US assessment of the situation was ""not true"".
""We're the only country on the continent where the colonisers came to stay and we have never driven them out of our country,"" he added, dismissing claims Afrikaners were being persecuted. 
Ramaphosa said dozens of white South Africans who arrived in the US on Monday ""don't fit the bill"" for refugees. 
According to the US embassy in South Africa, external, to be considered eligible for the refugee resettlement scheme, someone must be:
Of South African nationality
Afrikaner or from a racial minority
Able to cite an incident of past persecution or fear of persecution in the future.
The South African leader said he was due to meet his US counterpart soon regarding the issue.

437,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj86wqe0dlo,2025-05-14 08:49:49,"Human rights groups warn of 'surge' in migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia,","Human rights groups are warning of a ""surge"" of deaths of migrant construction workers in Saudi Arabia, as it prepares to host the World Cup in 2034.
Labourers are already dying from preventable workplace accidents in the country, according to Human Rights Watch and FairSquare which have both published reports today.
Many such deaths are wrongly classified as having occurred due to natural causes and the families of workers are not compensated, the reports say.
Both groups have called on the Saudi Authorities to ensure basic safety protections for the country's huge migrant work-force.
""The 2034 Saudi World Cup will be the largest and most expensive ever, but it could also have the highest cost in human lives, as millions of migrant workers build infrastructure, including 11 new stadiums, a rail and transit network, and 185,000 hotel rooms,"" Minky Worden, director of Global Initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said.
The warnings come a day after the President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, visited the country along with Donald Trump - attending a US-Saudi investment forum.
FIFA â football's global governing body - says it has a ""steadfast commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in the context of its operations.""
But Human Rights Watch has accused FIFA of failing to learn lessons from migrant worker deaths in the lead-up to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.
Data on migrant deaths is hard to come by in a country where human rights groups have very limited access and labour unions are banned.
But Human Rights Watch interviewed the families of 31 workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal who fell from heights, were crushed or decapitated by heavy machinery or were electrocuted.
Heat is another major concern, as Saudi Arabia ramps up construction work in preparation for hosting the 2034 tournament.
In March, a Pakistani foreman, Muhammad Arshad, was reported to have fallen from a construction site at a stadium being built in the eastern city of Al Khobar â the first death related to the World Cup.
Last year, the Saudi government said that there had been ""tangible achievements"" in occupational health and safety, with rates of deaths and injuries decreasing.
FIFA also praised ""significant steps"" taken by Saudi Arabia to reform its labour laws since 2018.
But the global construction worker's union, BWI, said there had been an ""alarming rise"" in accidents that could have been prevented.
""These are the result of systematic negligence, corruption and inadequate oversight and accountability,"" said BWI General Secretary, Ambet Yuson.
And Saudi medical authorities rarely conduct autopsies to establish the exact cause of migrant workers' deaths, according to FairSquare, external.
""Hundreds of thousands of young men, many of whom have young families, are being pitched into a labour system that poses a serious risk to their lives, a medical system that doesn't have the capacity to determine the cause of their deaths, and a political system that doesn't appear to either protect them or find out how they died, let alone compensate the families shattered by Saudi Arabia's negligence,"" FairSquare co-director James Lynch said.
He described FIFA's human rights policies as a ""sham.""
""While FIFA praises Saudi Arabia to the rafters and highly-paid western law firms generate vast profits for curating Saudi's reputation, children in places like Nepal grow up without their fathers and never even learn how they died, he said.""
The Saudi government says there have been improvements to its occupational health and safety, but rights groups are sceptical of the changes
FIFA told Human Rights Watch that it plans to establish a workers' welfare system dedicated to mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms for World Cup-related construction and service delivery in Saudi Arabia.
In a letter it said: ""We are convinced that the measures implemented to ensure construction companies respect the rights of their workers on FIFA World Cup sites can set a new standard for worker protection in the country and contribute to the wider labour reform process, helping to enhance protections for workers on World Cup sites and beyond.""
But Human Rights Watch, external said no further details were provided on how the welfare system would work.
""Saudi authorities, FIFA, and other employers should ensure that all migrant worker deaths, regardless of perceived cause, time, and place are properly investigated and that families of deceased workers are treated with dignity and receive fair and timely compensation,"" the group said.
The BBC has approached the Saudi authorities for comment."

Three bears have been rescued from the backyard of a residential home in Yerevan, Armenia, with the help of a Sussex-based charity.
The Syrian brown bears - Aram, Nairi and their daughter, Lola - were limited to ""filthy cages"" and denied ""basic care"", the Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets (FPWC) found during an investigation.
International Animal Rescue (IAR), based in Uckfield, told BBC South East that their joint rescue with FPWC on 20 March took over 12 hours.
The rescuers from IAR said the ""stench"" and ""filth"" was ""horrific"" and followed ""years of unimaginable cruelty"".
IAR say that during the rescue, the family of bears were sedated separately and moved from their ""filthy"" cages in crates by a crane
""The sheer cruelty of locking these animals up in tiny cages and feeding them cola, it was absolutely horrific,"" said Alan Knight, president of IAR.
Rescuers say the male bear (Aram) was held captive for 12 years and repeatedly bred with a female bear (Nairi) taken from the wild.
Their daughter, Lola, was discovered with them, while previous cubs had been taken and sold, according to IAR.
Mr Knight said: ""These were some of the worst conditions I have ever seen.""
IAR described the rescue as their ""most difficult one to date"".
Aram, the male bear, has broken teeth and infected gums, according to IAR
The rescue team say they were initially refused entry to the property by the bears' owner, despite having a legal order.
After a drawn out standoff, rescuers say they finally gained access at night-fall and worked to sedate and transport the bears ""under heavy rain and darkness"" using torches.
IAR told BBC South East that the three bears are now under supervised quarantine and receiving urgent veterinary care at FPWC's wildlife rescue centre in Urtsadzor, Armenia.
An appeal has been launched by IAR to fund their ongoing care and to help complete a new sanctuary where the bears can live.

Svitlana says her daughter loved her school in Poland.
""Even when we moved to another area, she didn't want to change schools,"" says the 31-year-old Ukrainian mother. ""She liked it so much. There was no bullying.""
Now she says the atmosphere at the school â and in Poland overall â has changed.
""Two weeks ago, she came home and said ""One boy said to me today, 'Go back to Ukraine'."" Svitlana was astonished.
She is one of dozens of Ukrainians living in Poland who have told the BBC that anti-Ukrainian sentiment has risen considerably in recent months.
Many described experiencing abuse on public transport, bullying in schools and xenophobic material online.
A polarising presidential election campaign has added to the tension, with the first round of voting taking place on Sunday.
Svitlana says her daughter has been bullied at school for being Ukrainian
The day after Svitlana's daughter was told to go back to Ukraine, the abuse became even worse.
""Girls from the class above started complaining about her speaking Ukrainian. Then they pretended to fall to the ground shouting 'Missile! Get down!' and laughing,"" Svitlana says. ""She came home crying.""
A Russian missile had slammed into Svitlana's hometown in Ukraine days before, killing scores of civilians, including children. Her daughter was traumatised.
Svitlana â not her real name  did not want to be identified as she fears reprisals. She showed us screenshots of messages with school staff where she complains about her daughter's treatment.
She said she had noticed attitudes changing towards Ukrainians in other places, too: ""At work, many people have been saying Ukrainians come here and behave badly. And my Ukrainian friends say they want to go home because Polish people don't accept us. It's frightening to live here now.""
According to government statistics, at least 2.5 million Ukrainians live in Poland, comprising almost 7% of the total population of Poland.
When the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, there was an outpouring of compassion from Poles. ""It was amazing. Every day people were calling, asking, 'How can we help?'"" says activist Natalia Panchenko, head of the Warsaw-based 'Stand with Ukraine' Foundation.
Natalia Panchenko's organisation has seen a rise in anti-Ukrainian abuse online - and in real life
""Some of them organised humanitarian convoys or brought refugees here. They gave their houses, food, everything they have â and their hearts, too.""
Three years later, Natalia says she believes the majority of Poles still support Ukraine. But some don't â and her organisation has noticed an upsurge of anti-Ukrainian online abuse that began several months ago.
""Then it started to come to real life,"" she says. ""Recently, we have more and more of these kinds of situationsâ¦ xenophobic [abuse] of people working in shops or hotels just because they speak with a Ukrainian accent.""
Natalia says that many Ukrainian refugees are traumatised. ""These groups of women and children are in Poland because of the war, very often their relatives are on the front line, in captivity or dead... and this is the group of people being targeted.""
Research suggests that Poland's public opinion of Ukrainians is indeed worsening. According to a March 2025 poll by the respected CBOS Centre, just 50% of Poles are in favour of accepting Ukrainian refugees, a fall of seven percentage points in four months. Two years ago, the figure was 81%.
Around a million Ukrainians are officially registered as having arrived after the start of the full-scale invasion. Poland spends 4.2% of its GDP on Ukrainian refugees.
Presidential front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski is playing down his pro-Ukrainian credentials in the campaign
Ukraine has become a hot-button political issue in Poland's crucial presidential election campaign.
Far-right populist Slawomir Mentzen, currently polling third, is virulently anti-Ukrainian and supports an ""agreement"" with Russia's Vladimir Putin. 
In second place is conservative Karol Nawrocki, who opposes EU and Nato membership for Ukraine and financial assistance for refugees, but supports the war effort. 
The most pro-Ukraine candidate is front-runner Rafal Trzaskowski from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's coalition, although even he has promised a reduction in social welfare for Ukrainians.
Trzaskowski has refrained from espousing his pro-Ukrainian credentials in order to attract the centrist vote in the elections, says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski. 
""He's responding to the change in public attitudes. The initial enthusiasm for supporting war victims is disappearing, negative sentiments are taking over and it's not an entirely comfortable issue for him.""
Another far-right candidate, Grzegorz Braun, is under investigation by police for tearing down a Ukrainian flag from a city hall building during an election rally in April. Braun, who is polling at just 3%, regularly fulminates against what he calls the ""Ukrainisation of Poland"".
Last week, the Polish government warned of an ""unprecedented attempt"" by Russia to interfere in the Polish elections by spreading ""false information among Polish citizens online"". Moscow denies all allegations of election interference.
Michal Marek, who runs an NGO that monitors disinformation and propaganda in Poland, offers some examples of the anti-Ukraine material being circulated on social media.
""The main narratives are that Ukrainians are stealing money from the Polish budget, that Ukrainians do not respect us, that they want to rob and kill us and are responsible for the war,"" he says. 
""This information starts in Russian-speaking Telegram channels, and, after that, we see the same photos and the same text just translated by Google Translate. And they are pushing [the material] into the Polish infosphere.""
Mr Marek links such disinformation directly with the increase in anti-Ukraine sentiment in Poland, and says an increasing number of Poles are becoming influenced by propaganda. 
""But we will only see the effect after the election - what percentage of Poles want to vote for openly pro-Russian candidates."""

Nearly five months on, authorities are still studying what may have caused the plane to crash-land at Muan International Airport and then burst into flames.
The police had already opened a criminal investigation before this latest complaint, and barred Jeju Air CEO Kim E-bae from leaving the country, but no one has been indicted over the incident. 
One of the relatives, Kim Da-hye, denounced the ""lack of progress"" in investigations. 
""We are filled with deep anger and despair. Having taken this extraordinary measure of filing a criminal complaint, we will not give up and will continue to pursue the truth,"" Mr Kim said in a statement to the media.
Among the 15 people named in the complaint were government officials, airline officials and airport staff responsible for construction, supervision, facility management and bird control. 
The complaint filed on Tuesday raises questions around the circumstances of the crash, including whether air traffic control responded appropriately and whether the reinforcement of a mound at the end of the runway violated regulations.
The aircraft, a Boeing 737-800, took off from the Thai capital of Bangkok on the morning of 29 December, and was flying to Muan in South Korea.
Five minutes after the pilots made contact with Muan International Airport, they reported striking a bird and declared a mayday signal. 
The pilots then tried to land from the opposite direction, during which the aircraft belly-landed without its landing gear deployed. It later overran the runway, slammed into a concrete structure and exploded.
Earlier this year, investigators said they found bird feathers in both engines of the jet, but did not conclude the extent to which the bird strike was a contributing factor. 
Since the incident, some bereaved families have also been targeted by a torrent of conspiracies and malicious jokes online.
These included suggestions that families were ""thrilled"" to receive compensation from authorities, or that they were ""fake victims"". As of March this year, eight people have been apprehended for making such derogatory and defamatory online posts.

Trump has agreed to ""say hello"" to Syria's interim president on Wednesday in Saudi Arabia as part of his tour of the Middle East, the White House said.
The announcement of the lifting of sanctions was met with elation in the Syrian capital of Damascus, where cheering, dancing and celebratory gunfire were heard. 
The sanctions had previously blocked any foreign financing, including aid, from reaching Syria and were originally intended to put pressure on the dictatorship of now-ousted President Bashar al-Assad.
Trump said the policy change would give Syria ""a chance at greatness"", telling an investment forum in Saudi Arabia's Riyadh, ""it's their time to shine.""
Syria's Foreign Minister AsaadÂ al-Shaibani celebrated the decision as a ""pivotal turning point for the country"" in an interview with the country's state news agency, Sana. 
The country looks forward to a future of ""stability, self-sufficiency and genuine reconstruction after years of a destructive war"", he added.
Ninety percent of Syria's population were left under the poverty line at the end of Assad's regime and its new government has been pushing for an end to sanctions since Assad was overthrown in December.
Al-Sharaa told the BBC in an interview late last year that Syria was not a threat to the world and called for sanctions to be lifted. 
He also called for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist group who overthrew Assad, to be de-listed as a terrorist organisation. It is designated as one by the UN, US, EU and UK, among many others, as it started as a splinter group of al-Qaeda, which it broke away from in 2016.
Al-Sharaa repeated these calls at a joint press conference with France's President Emmanuel Macron last week, saying ""these sanctions were imposed on the previous regime because of the crimes it committed, and this regime is gone.""
The Syrian leader has promised to protect ethnic minorities since his Sunni Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad's regime in December after 13 years of devastating civil war.
However, the mass killings of hundreds of civilians from Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region in March, during clashes between the new security forces and Assad loyalists, has hardened fears among minority communities.
There have also been deadly clashes between Islamist armed factions, security forces and fighters from the Druze religious minority.

The US's announcement is a major boost for al-Sharaa, and also marks a significant foreign policy shift for the US, which previously said it would not lift sanctions on Syria until issues such as minority rights progressed in the country.
Trump said his announcement followed a request from Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. 
""Oh, what I do for the Crown Prince,"" the US leader said, adding, ""I like him too much.""
The pair met on Tuesday on Trump's first stop of his tour of the Middle East, where they jointly announced a $142bn (Â£107bn) arms deal.
Former US ambassador to Syria Robert Ford, who served under former President Barack Obama, applauded the Trump administration's move to lift sanctions.
""I visited Syria three months ago and the country is simply devastated after the 13-year civil war. It needs to rebuild, it needs reconstruction, it needs foreign financing to do that,"" he told the BBC.
""So removing the sanctions, that will enable international capital flows to go into Syria from Gulf states, from other Arab states and from different aid agencies is absolutely vital.""
The tour of the Arab Gulf states will also see Trump visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates."

A Los Angeles judge has reduced the sentence of Erik and Lyle Menendez, making them eligible for parole more than 30 years after they killed their parents in a Beverly Hills mansion.
Judge Michael Jesic resentenced the brothers on Tuesday, after hearing evidence from relatives and prison staff about their attempts to make amends while behind bars.
The district attorney had argued that they were not rehabilitated, but now the state parole board will consider the possibility of the brothers' release as early as next month.
The brothers have long argued that they killed Kitty and Jose Menendez out of self-defence after years of sexual abuse, in a high-profile case that prompted a Netflix show which renewed interest in the story.
After hearing that they had been resentenced to 50 years to life with the possibility of parole, the brothers delivered an emotional statement to the court. 
They went through grim details of the brutal killings and their decision to reload their shotguns and keep shooting their parents at point-blank range in the living room of their home. The siblings were aged 18 and 21 at the time.
""I had to stop being selfish and immature to really understand what my parents went though in those last moments,"" Erik Menendez, 54, told the court.
He described the ""shock, confusion and betrayal"" they must have felt seeing their sons holding guns and opening fire.
When might the Menendez brothers be released?

Both apologised for their actions and talked about their hopes of working with sex abuse victims and helping those incarcerated if they were given a second chance outside prison. 
The voice of Lyle Menendez, 57, cracked as he talked about the impact of his ""unfathomable"" actions on their relatives.
""I lied to you and forced you into a spotlight of public humiliation,"" he said to his family.
Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the decision to resentence the pair was ""monumental"" and carried ""significant implications for the families involved"".
Much of the hearing centred on what the brothers have been doing in prison for the last 30 years. 
Family members and those who worked with them in prison detailed the educational courses they completed and programmes they created to improve the lives of inmates, including a hospice initiative for the elderly and sick.
Judge Jesic called the brothers' work while in prison ""remarkable"", but noted that their 1996 sentences to life without parole were justified at the time.
He said that under the guidelines, they were eligible for resentencing, issuing his new sentence of 50 years to life. The brothers have been held in custody since 1990.
As the judge continued reading, the brothers smiled and waved to their attorneys and family members who crowded into the courtroom. Family members embraced with smiles. 
""Today is a great day,"" defence lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters outside court. He said they were ""one huge step closer to bringing the boys home"". 
Anamaria Baralt, the brothers' cousin who testified inside court earlier in the day, said their family was elated. 
""It is a difficult process,"" she said of the parole hearing that awaits the brothers, but noted they will ""eagerly step through those doors if it means we can have them home"".
Inside court earlier, relatives pleaded with the judge to allow the siblings' release.
Ms Baralt, who said she has been close with them since they were children, told the judge they deserved a ""second chance at life"".
""It's been a nightmare,"" she said. ""I am desperate for this process to be over.""
Ms Baralt told the court she speaks with the brothers frequently and testified that they had taken ""ownership of their actions"". 
Prosecutors claim retaliation by new LA DA over Menendez brothers support
What is the controversy around Netflix's Menendez drama?
She said Lyle Menendez had acknowledged to her he had asked a witness to lie when testifying at their previous trial.
But she added: ""They are very different men from the boys they were.""
The judge also heard from a retired Florida judge - who said he has never testified on behalf of any criminal defendant - and Anerae ""X-Raided"" Brown, a rapper who was in prison with both brothers and credits their help for his release.
The district attorney's office, which fiercely opposes the brothers being released, questioned each witness about Erik and Lyle Menendez's ""litany of lies"" they have clung to since the murders.
Menendez brothers, Erik, left, and Lyle on the steps of their Beverly Hills home in November 1989
Prosecutors said they lied to law enforcement immediately after the crimes, lied to family members about their guilt and gave false evidence at their trials.
Prosecutors have said the brothers have continued to ""make excuses"" for their conduct instead of taking full responsibility. 
""There's no doubt they've done all these positive things in prison,"" Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian said in his closing argument. 
But, he added, when reversing a jury's unanimous verdict in such a brutal murder case, it's important to ""make certain they are truly rehabilitated"".
The case was thrust back into the spotlight after a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, as well as the release of docudrama, The Menendez Brothers.
It introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released. The previous district attorney, George GascÃ³n, backed their resentencing bid, allowing the effort to go before a judge. 
The next step for the brothers will be the California parole board. 
The board has already been vetting the siblings after a request by Governor Gavin Newsom. The governor is separately weighing a request from the brothers for clemency, which could take the form of a reduced sentence or a pardon - if approved.
A risk assessment has been completed on the brothers as part of their request for clemency. The district attorney said it indicated a ""moderate risk of violence"". However, the full report has not been released. 
Newsom asked the parole board to conduct a risk assessment, which has already been drafted, that examines whether they pose a risk to the general public if released. 
The state's parole board is set to conduct a separate hearing on 13 June for the brothers.
It's unclear what could come at the hearing, or if there might be multiple hearings vetting their potential release."

Former world champion cyclist Rohan Dennis has been given a two-year suspended sentence over a car incident in Australia which killed his wife, fellow Olympian Melissa Hoskins.
Dennis pleaded guilty to one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm, after Hoskins was struck by the car he was driving during a fight outside the couple's Adelaide home in 2023.
A judge said Dennis had disregarded his wife's safety, but was not criminally responsible for her death.
Hoskins' parents spoke outside the court after sentencing, saying they were ""glad"" the case was over and they hoped the family could ""move on"".
The court had previously heard that Dennis and Hoskins were arguing about kitchen renovations shortly before the incident occurred, and Hoskins had held on to the car her husband was driving as he tried to leave.
While sentencing Dennis, Judge Ian Press said calling the incident tragic ""really does not do justice to the grief, the anguish and the turmoil those events have brought into the lives of those who knew and loved your wife"".
He said he understood that Dennis had tried to ""de-escalate the argument"" by driving off, but said it did not excuse his actions.
""It was your obligation to stop the vehicle when driving that vehicle became dangerous to her physical wellbeing,"" he said, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
""That you did not stop because you wanted to leave, is a very poor reason for not doing so.""
Hoskins was taken to hospital after being struck but later died of her injuries.
Dennis was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care and pleaded not guilty, but he later admitted to a single, lesser charge.
Dennis' lawyer had argued that he had no intention of harming his wife and either did not know or was ""reckless to the fact"" that Hoskins was holding onto the car.
She  told an earlier hearing that despite his ""stoic"" front, Dennis felt a ""deep, deep grief"".
On Wednesday, Judge Press emphasised that Dennis was not criminally responsible for causing Hoskins' death, and accepted he was remorseful.
""I accept you have a sense of responsibility for all that occurred. I accept you have anguished over what could have been different if you had acted in some other way,"" Judge Press said.
In victim impact statements read to the court last month, Hoskins' mother said that while she accepted Dennis wouldn't have intentionally hurt her daughter, his temper was his ""downfall"" and ""needs to be addressed"".
Speaking outside court, Peter and Amanda Hoskins said they missed their daughter ""terribly"".
""She was someone really special,"" Mr Hoskins said.
Hoskins competed for Australia at two Olympics
He said the family was yet to receive an apology from Dennis, but expected it ""will come with time"".
""It's now time for us to move on, which would be Melissa's expectations of us,"" Mr Hoskins said, adding it was important for the couple to have a ""well-mannered relationship"" with Dennis going forward.
""There are two young children caught up in this tragedy... Clearly, we want to continue to be an integral part of [the] children's lives and their future.""
Hoskins was a world champion cyclist in the Australian team pursuit in 2015, and a two-time Olympian. Her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world.
She and Dennis married in 2018.
Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a cycling career in which he won a silver medal team pursuit at the London 2012 Olympics and a road time trial bronze at Tokyo 2020. He also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022."

While the Alien Enemies Act was enacted to prevent foreign espionage, the Trump administration has invoked it as the legal basis for the deportation of hundreds of alleged gang members.
In March, the US deported 261 alleged Venezuelan gang members to a notorious jail in El Salvador. Of those,137 were removed under the act, the White House said.
Trump has alleged that the migrants were members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang ""conducting irregular warfare"" against the US. However some civil rights groups say the Trump's use of the act is illegal and discriminates against immigrants based on their ancestry.
White House denies defying judge's order over deportations 
What is Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang targeted by Trump?
The Alien Enemies Act grants the president of the United States sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of foreign enemies.
It was passed in 1798 when the US believed it would enter a war with France.
The act states that ""whenever there shall be a declared war [...] or any invasion or predatory incursion shall be perpetrated, attempted, or threatened"" against the US, all ""subjects of the hostile nation or government"" could be ""apprehended, restrained, secured and removed, as alien enemies"".
The act has only been previously used three times - all during times of conflict involving the US.
It was last invoked in World War Two, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.
People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.
Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.
Judges in New York, Colorado and Texas have ruled against Trump's use of the law to deport Venezuelans.
The Supreme Court ruled on 7 April that Trump could use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members, but deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal.
That prompted civil rights groups to file lawsuits seeking to protect Venezuelans who may be targeted by the act. Several lower courts imposed temporary orders blocking deportations.
Weeks later, the Supreme Court was again asked to intervene to stop deportations under the act. On 19 April, it ordered the Trump administration to pause the deportation of a group of Venezuelans detained in north Texas after their lawyers argued they had not been told about their right to contest the decision in court.
On 1 May, Trump-appointed federal judge Fernando Rodriguez ruled that the US president cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. This was the first time a federal judge had ruled the use of the act was ""unlawful"".
But on 13 May, a federal judge in Pennsylvania, Stephanie Haines, said Trump could use the Alien Enemies Act to remove accused gang members from the state. She also ruled they must be given at least 21 days notice and an opportunity to challenge their deportations. 
At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to ""eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil"".
In his proclamation on 15 March, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an ""invasion"" against the US. He declared its members ""liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies"".
Trump has repeatedly attacked judges who have issued rulings critical of his use of the act.
In March, federal judge James Boasberg attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had ""no lawful basis"", and that the removals had already taken place.
This led to a back-and-forth between the judge, located in Washington DC, and the government. Boasberg dismissed the government's response to his order as ""woefully insufficient"", and warned of consequences if the Trump administration had violated his ruling. 
Donald Trump hit back on social media, saying Boasberg should be impeached and calling him a  ""grandstander"".
One of the president's top aides, Stephen Miller, recently said the administration was ""actively looking at"" suspending habeas corpus.
The legal principle - which literally means ""you should have the body"" - allows for a person to be brought before a judge so the legality of their detention can be decided by a judge.
Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.
Speaking to BBC News, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: ""There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.""
Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, said the administration was ""pushing the bounds of executive authority, especially on immigration issues"".
""When the executive branch wilfully disregards clear and specific court orders, as the administration did with the [Venezuelan] deportation flights, the checks-and-balances system established by the U.S. Constitution is at risk, and our constitutional democracy is threatened,"" she said.
Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.
""The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings"", she added.
Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it ""unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration"" and ""evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps""."

An inmate who allegedly knifed hip-hop artist Tory Lanez inside a US prison is a convicted killer, say prison officials.
The Canadian rapper was rushed to hospital after being stabbed 14 times on Monday morning at a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi.
The prisoner suspected of the attack, Santino Casio, 41, is serving a life sentence for murder, officials told the BBC. They said he has been placed in ""restricted housing"" pending an investigation into the attack on Lanez, 32.
The rapper, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for shooting fellow musician Megan Thee Stallion in 2020.
Casio arrived at the Tehachapi institution from Los Angeles County jail in February 2004.
""He was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for second-degree murder, first degree attempted murder, personal use of a dangerous or deadly weapon, and inflict [sic] great bodily injury,"" said a statement from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).
Casio has added to his criminal record during his incarceration, the statement added.
In January 2008, he was sentenced to six years for assaulting a fellow prisoner with a deadly weapon.
In 2018, he was sentenced to another two years for possessing a deadly weapon.
Santino Casio has previously been convicted for committing offenses in prison
Casio's alleged attack left Tory Lanez with wounds across his body, causing both of his lungs to collapse, according to a post on the rapper's Instagram account.
He was stabbed in the back, torso, head and face, and had to temporarily be placed on a breathing apparatus, the Instagram post added.
""Despite being in pain, he is talking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through,"" the post said.
Lanez was sentenced in 2023 for three felony gun-related charges, including assault with a semi-automatic firearm.
He shot Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, as they were leaving a pool party at reality star Kylie Jenner's Hollywood mansion.
Lanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction. He has teased the release of a new album from prison titled Peterson."

According to the book, Original Sin, Biden's condition during his 2024 presidential run was said to be so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair. 
A spokesperson for Biden, 82, said ""evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity"" and maintained the Democrat had been ""a very effective president"". 
The book, by CNN's Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, is due to be released on 20 May. 
Biden abruptly ended his re-election campaign last July shortly after his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, a Republican.
Party insiders blamed him for exiting the race too late, leaving his replacement, Vice-President Kamala Harris, 107 days to challenge Trump, who swept to victory.
Ahead of the book's release, Biden last week gave his first interview since leaving the White House to the BBC, saying: ""I don't think it would have mattered"" if he had left the race sooner. 
Biden: Withdrawing from 2024 race earlier ""wouldn't have mattered""
While the book largely cites anonymous sources in interviews with more than 200 people, one of the few to be quoted on the record is David Plouffe, who worked on Vice-President Harris's campaign.
""We got so screwed by Biden as a party,"" the book quotes Plouffe as saying.
The authors write: ""Biden's physical deterioration - most apparent in his halting walk - had become so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.
""Given Biden's age, [his physician Kevin O'Connor] also privately said that if he had another bad fall, a wheelchair might be necessary for what could be a difficult recovery,"" the book adds.
Biden's physical condition had declined so much, the authors said, that aides had sought to ensure he walked shorter distances, used handrails when mounting stairs, and wore trainers more often. 
At the time, Biden aides repeatedly told reporters his altered gait was due to a foot fracture in November 2020 and his subsequent refusal to consistently wear his prescribed surgical boot. 
In a statement to Axios, an anonymous Biden aide said: ""Yes, there were physical changes as he got older, but evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity.""
The spokesperson added: ""We are still waiting for someone, anyone, to point out where Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable to do his job because of mental decline. 
""In fact, the evidence points to the opposite - he was a very effective president.""
Tapper and Thompson's book also says that Biden did not recognise George Clooney at a star-studded California campaign fundraiser last June  hosted by the Hollywood star. 
""Thank you for being here,"" Biden told Clooney at the event, apparently unaware he was speaking to the Academy Award winner. 
""You know George,"" an aide reportedly told Biden, as he was struggled to work out Clooney's identity. 
Not long after the incident, Clooney wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times calling on Biden to quit the race. The actor was one of the first major donors to publicly withdraw his support. 
The book also alleges that Biden forgot the names of veteran aides, including trusted loyalist Mike Donilon, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and White House communications director Kate Bedingfield."

A duck has been caught speeding on traffic cameras in the town of Koeniz in central Switzerland.
Local police said the mallard - a wild duck - was snapped on radar images on 13 April clocking in at 52km/h (32 mph) in a 30km zone.
Adding to the mystery, authorities said the duck was likely a repeat offender and shared an image of a similar looking duck travelling in the same spot, at the same speed and on the same date in 2018.
There has been speculation about whether the ""notorious racer"" duck incident was a belated April Fool's joke, but the police inspectorate said it is impossible to manipulate images on the radar system.

Speaking in Riyadh, the US president also pledged to lift all sanctions against Syria, saying it was now time for the country to move forward with ""a chance at greatness"". 
Day one of the tour saw the US and Saudi Arabia announce a $142bn (Â£107bn) arms deal, as well as other investments that the country's crown prince said could eventually be worth $1tn.
Trump also made Saudi Arabia the first foreign stop during his first term, in 2017. The rest of his trip will include stops in Qatar and the UAE.
US President Donald Trump and Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman photographed with other officials in Riyadh
Trump's arrival in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday was met with a grand reception, including a lavish lavender-coloured carpet rolled out to greet him. He had even chosen a purple tie to match it.
Riyadh swapped red carpets for lavender in 2021, saying that it was a symbol of the kingdom's desert wildflowers and generosity.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met Trump on the tarmac and provided an honour guard of Arabian horses to accompany his presidential limo. 
In his remarks at an investment forum, Trump lauded the US-Saudi relationship as ""more powerful than ever before"". 
""From the moment we started we've seen wealth that has poured - and is pouring - into America,"" he said. 
Trump is trying to woo foreign investors to the US to boost the American economy, a key focus of his administration in the nearly four months of his second term.
""I like him too much,"" Trump said of Saudi Arabia's crown prince and de-facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. ""That's why we give so much.""
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is one of a few corporate leaders that joined Donald Trump on his trip to Riyadh
The pomp and ceremony was a step up from the muted welcome for former US President Joe Biden, who travelled to the oil-rich kingdom in 2022 to seek their help in lowering petrol prices, fist-bumping the crown prince.
That visit came two years after he declared Saudi Arabia a ""pariah"" state following the 2018 murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump flew to the Gulf to strike financial deals and argued in his speech that it is through this kind of commerce and economic development that the Middle East would transcend violence and division. 
Underscoring his commitment to deal-making, Trump was joined by a number of business leaders including billionaire ally Elon Musk, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.
The high-profile executives are meeting a Saudi Arabia eager to diversify its oil-rich economy by increasing its artificial intelligence capabilities. 
Mr Huang announced during the visit that Nvidia will sell more than 18,000 of its latest AI chips to Saudi company Humain.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accompanied Donald Trump and other business leaders during the president's trip to Riyadh
During his address, Trump said it was his ""dream"" to have Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords, a deal brokered in his first administration that saw relations between Israel and some Gulf countries normalised for the first time.
But his good friend, Mohammed bin Salman, has made it clear that will not happen until there is a permanent end to the war in Gaza and a clear path to Palestinian statehood. 
There is a limit to what this friendship can deliver. 
Trump only briefly addressed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. 
He told those in attendance that people in Gaza deserved a ""better future"", which had been held back by Hamas choosing ""to kidnap, torture and target"" for ""political ends"" - a reference to the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. 
Trump also announced he was lifting sanctions on Syria to improve the country's new government, a move he suggested was requested by Mohammed bin Salman.
""Oh, what I do for the crown prince,"" the US leader said. 
American sanctions on Syria had been in place for over a decade, meant to apply pressure and economic pain against the dictatorship of former President Bashar al-Assad, who was ousted in December.
Syria has since elected a new transitional president, creating an opening for renewed US diplomacy efforts. 
The surprise announcement to lift the sanctions represents a sea change for Syria, described by its foreign minister Asaad Shibani as a ""new start"" in the country's reconstruction path.
Robert Ford, who served as US ambassador to Syria under President Barack Obama, applauded the Trump administration's move to lift sanctions. 
""I visited Syria three months ago and the country is simply devastated after the 13-year civil war. It needs to rebuild, it needs reconstruction, it needs foreign financing to do that,"" he told the BBC.
""So removing the sanctions, that will enable international capital flows to go into Syria from Gulf states, from other Arab states and from different aid agencies is absolutely vital.""
Trump was expected to meet Syria's transitional president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, on Wednesday in Saudi Arabia. 
From Riyadh, Trump will head to both Qatar and the UAE, which has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next decade."

The ex-guerrilla who governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015 was known as the world's ""poorest president"" because of his modest lifestyle.
Current President YamandÃº Orsi announced his predecessor's death on X, writing: ""ThankÂ youÂ forÂ everythingÂ youÂ gaveÂ usÂ andÂ forÂ yourÂ deepÂ loveÂ forÂ yourÂ people.""
The politician's cause of death is not known but he had been suffering from oesophageal cancer.
Because of the simple way he lived as president, his criticism of consumerism and the social reforms he promoted - which, among other things, meant Uruguay became the first country to legalise the recreational use of marijuana - Mujica became a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond.
His global popularity is unusual for a president of Uruguay, a country with just 3.4 million inhabitants where his legacy has also generated some controversy.
In fact, even though many tended to see Mujica as someone outside the political class, that was not the case.
He said his passion for politics, as well as for books and working the land, was passed on to him by his mother, who raised him in a middle-class home in Montevideo, the capital city.
As a young man, Mujica was a member of the National Party, one of Uruguay's traditional political forces, which later became the centre-right opposition to his government.
In the 1960s, he helped set up the Tupamaros National Liberation Movement (MLN-T), a leftist urban guerrilla group that carried out assaults, kidnappings and executions, although he always maintained that he did not commit any murder.
Influenced by the Cuban revolution and international socialism, the MLN-T launched a campaign of clandestine resistance against the Uruguayan government, which at the time was constitutional and democratic, although the left accused it of being increasingly authoritarian.
During this period, Mujica was captured four times. On one of those occasions, in 1970, he was shot six times and nearly died.
Mujica will be remembered for the simple lifestyle he adopted in and out of politics
He escaped from prison twice, on one occasion through a tunnel with 105 other MLN-T prisoners, in one of the largest escapes in Uruguayan prison history.
When the Uruguayan military staged a coup in 1973, they included him in a group of ""nine hostages"" who they threatened to kill if the guerrillas continued their attacks.
During the more than 14 years he spent in prison during the 1970s and 1980s, he was tortured and spent most of that time in harsh conditions and isolation, until he was freed in 1985 when Uruguay returned to democracy.
He used to say that during his time in prison, he experienced madness first hand, suffering from delusions and even talking to ants.
The day he was freed was his happiest memory, he says: ""Becoming president was insignificant compared to that.""
Mujica (left) on the day he was freed in Montevideo in March 1985
A few years after his release, he served as a lawmaker, both in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate, the country's lower and upper houses respectively.
In 2005, he became minister in the first government of the Frente Amplio, the Uruguayan leftist coalition, before becoming Uruguay's president in 2010.
He was 74 years old at the time, and, to the rest of the world, still unknown.
His election marked an important moment for the Latin American left, which was already strong on the continent at that time. Mujica became leader alongside other left-wing presidents such as Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva in Brazil and Hugo ChÃ¡vez in Venezuela.
However, Mujica governed in his own way, demonstrating pragmatism and audacity on several occasions, political commentators say.
Listen to an interview with Mujica on BBC Witness History
During his administration, amid a fairly favourable international context, the Uruguayan economy grew at an average annual rate of 5.4%, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low.
Uruguay also drew global attention for the social laws passed by parliament during those years, such as the legalisation of abortion, the recognition of same-sex marriage, and state regulation of the marijuana market.
While in office, Mujica rejected moving into the presidential residence (a mansion), as heads of state around the world usually do.
Instead, he remained with his wife - politician and former guerrilla LucÃ­a Topolansky - in their modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo, with no domestic help and little security.
This combined with the fact that he always dressed casually, that he was often seen driving his light blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and gave away a large portion of his salary, led some media outlets to call him ""the world's poorest president"".
But Mujica always rejected that title: ""They say I'm the poorest president. No, I'm not,"" he told me in a 2012 interview at his home. ""Poor are those who want more [...] because they're in an endless race.""
Despite Mujica preaching austerity, his government did significantly increase public spending, widening the fiscal deficit and leading his opponents to accuse him of waste.
Mujica was also criticised for failing to reverse the growing problems in Uruguayan education, despite having promised that education would be a top priority for his administration.
However, unlike other leaders in the region, he was never accused of corruption or of undermining his country's democracy.
By the end of his administration, Mujica had a high domestic popularity rating (close to 70%) and was elected senator, but also spent part of his time travelling the world after he stepped down as president.
""So what it is that catches the world's attention? That I live with very little, a simple house, that I drive around in an old car? Then this world is crazy because it's surprised by [what is] normal,"" he reflected before leaving office.
Mujica's political heir, YamandÃº Orsi, was elected president of Uruguay in November
Mujica retired from politics in 2020 though he remained a central figure in Uruguay.
His political heir, YamandÃº Orsi, was elected president of Uruguay in November 2024 and his group within the Frente Amplio obtained the largest number of parliamentary seats since the country's return to democracy.
Last year, Mujica announced he had cancer and references to his age and the inexorable proximity of death became more frequent - but he always accepted the final outcome as something natural, without drama.
In the last interview he gave the BBC in November last year, he said: ""One knows that death is inevitable. And perhaps it's like the salt of life."""
450,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2e373yzndro,2025-05-13 23:35:23,"How real is the risk of nuclear war between India and Pakistan?,","India's nuclear capable Agni-5 missile has a range of over 5,000km
In the latest India-Pakistan stand-off, there were no ultimatums, no red buttons.
Yet the cycle of military retaliation, veiled signals and swift international mediation quietly evoked the region's most dangerous shadow. The crisis didn't spiral towards nuclear war, but it was a reminder of how quickly tensions here can summon that spectre.
Even scientists have modelled how easily things could unravel. A 2019 study by a global team of scientists opened with a nightmare scenario, external where a terrorist attack on India's parliament in 2025 triggers a nuclear exchange with Pakistan. 
Six years later, a real-world stand-off - though contained by a US-brokered ceasefire on Saturday - stoked fears of a full-blown conflict. It also revived uneasy memories of how fragile stability in the region can be. 
As the crisis escalated, Pakistan sent ""dual signals"" - retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting, a calculated reminder of its nuclear capability. The NCA oversees control and potential use of the country's nuclear arsenal. Whether this move was symbolic, strategic or a genuine alert, we may never know. It also came just as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly stepped in to defuse the spiral.
President Trump said the US didn't just broker a ceasefire - it averted a ""nuclear conflict"", external. On Monday, in an address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ""[There] is no tolerance for nuclear blackmail; India will not be intimidated by nuclear threats.
""Any terrorist safe haven operating under this pretext will face precise and decisive strikes,"" Modi added.
India and Pakistan each possess about 170 nuclear weapons, external, according to the think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). As of January 2024, Sipri estimated there were 12,121 nuclear warheads worldwide. Of these, about 9,585 were held in military stockpiles, with 3,904 actively deployed - 60 more than the previous year. The US and Russia together account for more than 8,000 nuclear weapons.
The bulk of both India's and Pakistan's deployed arsenals lies in their land-based missile forces, though both are developing nuclear triads capable of delivering warheads by land, air and sea, according to Christopher Clary, a security affairs expert at the University at Albany in the US. 
""India likely has a larger air leg (aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons) than Pakistan. While we know the least of Pakistan's naval leg, it is reasonable to assess that India's naval leg is more advanced and more capable than Pakistan's sea-based nuclear force,"" he told the BBC.
One reason, Mr Clary said, is that Pakistan has invested nowhere near the ""time or money"" that India has in building a nuclear-powered submarine, giving India a ""clear qualitative"" edge in naval nuclear capability.
Since testing nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan has never formally declared an official nuclear doctrine. 
India, by contrast, adopted a no-first-use policy following its own 1998 tests. But this stance has shown signs of softening. In 2003, India reserved the right to use nuclear weapons, external in response to chemical or biological attacks - effectively allowing for first use under certain conditions.
Further ambiguity emerged in 2016, when thenâdefence minister Manohar Parrikar suggested India shouldn't feel ""bound"" by the policy, external, raising questions about its long-term credibility. (Parrikar clarified that this was his own opinion.)
Pakistan's surface-to-surface Shaheen II missile is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead
The absence of a formal doctrine doesn't mean Pakistan lacks one - official statements, interviews and nuclear developments offer clear clues, external to its operational posture, according to Sadia Tasleem of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Pakistan's nuclear threshold remains vague, but in 2001, Khalid Kidwai - then head of the Strategic Plans Division of the NCA - outlined four red lines: major territorial loss, destruction of key military assets, economic strangulation or political destabilisation.
In 2002, then-president Pervez Musharraf clarified that ""nuclear weapons are aimed solely at India"", and would only be used if ""the very existence of Pakistan as a state"" was at stake.
In his memoir, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote that he was jolted awake at night to speak with an unnamed ""Indian counterpart"" who feared Pakistan was preparing to use nuclear weapons during the 2019 stand-off with India.
Around the same time, Pakistani media quoted a senior official, external issuing a stark warning to India: ""I hope you know what the [National Command Authority] means and what it constitutes. I said that we will surprise you. Wait for that surpriseâ¦ You have chosen a path of war without knowing the consequences for the peace and security of the region.""
During the 1999 Kargil War, Pakistan's then-foreign secretary Shamshad Ahmed warned that the country would not ""hesitate to use any weapon"", external to defend its territory. Years later, US official Bruce Riedel revealed that intelligence indicated Pakistan was preparing its nuclear arsenal for possible deployment, external.

But there is scepticism on both sides over such claims. 
Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria wrote in his memoir that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict in 2019. And during Kargil, Pakistan ""knew the Indian Air Force wouldn't cross into its territory"" - so there was no real trigger for even an implicit nuclear threat, insist Pakistani analysts. 
""Strategic signalling reminds the world that any conflict can spiral - and with India and Pakistan, the stakes are higher due to the nuclear overhang. But that doesn't mean either side is actively threatening nuclear use,"" Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC.
But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. ""This could happen by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from satellites and unstable leaders,"" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of scientists, told the BBC.
In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later, India's government sacked three air force officers for the ""accidental firing of a missile"".)
Yet, the danger of nuclear war remains ""relatively small"" between India and Pakistan, according to Mr Clary. 
""So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,"" he said. 
""In ground combat, the 'use it or lose it' problem is propelled by the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the enemy."" ('Use it or lose it, external' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a first strike by an adversary.)
The Chagai Hills, whitened at the top after Pakistan's nuclear tests in May 1998, in south-western Balochistan
Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, believes that ""neither India nor Pakistan wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear taboo"".
""Furthermore, any side that resorts to the use of nuclear weapons would face substantial retaliation and suffer unacceptable casualties,"" Mr Ganguly told the BBC.
At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their nuclear arsenal. 
With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could reach around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear Notebook, external, researched by the Federation of American Scientists' Nuclear Information Project.  
And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads, external, according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.
Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. ""The deterrent is still holding. All Pakistanis did was to respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of their own,"" writes, external Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst.
Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.
""When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable level of danger,""John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.
""The Indian and Pakistani governments have navigated these situations in the past, so the risk is small.  But with nuclear weapons, even a small risk is too large."""

El Chapo, Kasongo, Hustler, Deputy Jesus and Chicken Seller are just some that he has acquired in recent years.
As is often the case when people are given alternative monikers, some are affectionate but some are intended to mock, while others reflect a profound anger.
A history of the president's aliases offer a window into how the perception of him has changed.
Ruto has acknowledged the rechristening trend, joking recently that Kenyans are ""finishing"" him with the numerous labels.
""You have given me so many names. I had the name William Kipchirchir Samoei Ruto. You added Survivorâ¦ Zakayo... now you are at Kasongo [the title of a Congolese song about abandonment and heartbreak]. Will you stop at 10, or should I prepare for more?"" he recently asked.
The crowd, at a rally in the capital, Nairobi, responded that they had even more.
Before he was elected president in 2022, Ruto attracted handles that bolstered his reputation as a man of the people.
Hustler - Kenyan parlance for someone eking out a living against the odds - helped portray him as someone who would prioritise the needs of the struggling folk.
Chicken Seller, referring to his childhood when he hawked poultry on the roadside, resonated with many who saw his life as an epitome of their own.
""These were very positive [names]. They sold him to the public in terms of votes,"" political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC, arguing that they helped catapult him into the top job. 
""Names really stick with Ruto,"" he added.
Ruto gained a reputation among Kenyans struggling to get by that he understood their plight
But the president has been a high-profile figure in Kenyan politics for a long time, including serving as deputy president for nine years until 2022, and has never been far from controversy.
Prof Manyora recalls the label Arap Mashamba â which translates as ""son of farms"" â coined just under a decade ago and relates to Ruto's ownership of vast tracts of land across the country. Concerns have been raised about how some of these have been acquired.
In 2013, a court ordered Ruto to surrender a 100-acre (40-hectare) farm and compensate a farmer who had accused him of grabbing it during the 2007 post-election violence. He denied any wrongdoing.
Ruto's penchant for quoting Bible verses also earned him the Deputy Jesus tag. He has also been given the name Nabii, or prophet.
However, it is since his rise to the presidency that the nickname manufacturers have been working overtime â with at least a dozen being created - and they have become increasingly critical.
One that has stood out is Zakayo - Swahili for the name Zaccheaus, a Biblical figure who is portrayed as a greedy tax collector who climbed a tree to see Jesus.
The âtax collectorâ president sparking Kenyan anger
BBC identifies security forces who shot Kenya anti-tax protesters
Ruto's government introduced a raft of unpopular taxes and many Kenyans began to say that he had betrayed the ""hustlers"".
""He failed to deliver after becoming president,"" Prof Manyora said.
The pain of paying more taxes, and a perception that the extra money will be wasted, is the focus of many conversations.
Last year, young people came out onto the streets of Nairobi for weeks of protests, which turned deadly, against a fresh government proposal to raise taxes that was later dropped.
Last year's anti-tax protests galvanised young people angry at the government over the state of the economy
The chant ""Ruto must go"" became a rallying call for the demonstrators and now Must Go has become another way to refer to the leader.
The creative christeners have also focussed on the allegation that the president enjoys foreign travel.
Hence the title Vasco da Ganya â a play on the name of the 15th Century Portuguese explorer, Vasco da Gama, and the Swahili word danganya, which means ""to lie"".
Africa's 'flying presidents' under fire
Ruto's honesty has also been called into question with Kaunda Uongoman, which mimics late Congolese musician Kanda Bongoman.
The first part refers to the president's love for the Kaunda suit - a safari jacket with matching trousers â and Uongoman, which incorporates the Swahili word uongo, meaning ""lies"".
But the president seems impervious to this volley of verbal attacks.
Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said the manifold nicknames ""don't raise concerns"" in the office of the president but simply ""capture how people view a person"".
Ruto is ""very hands-on and doing his best to transform the economy... It's normal for any leader to have many nicknames as this signifies his various attributes and initiatives as a leader"", he told the BBC.
Mwaura also argued that the government has had to raise taxes to pay for new projects, reduce the budget deficit and fix the economy.
Nevertheless, when people have gone beyond inventing new names and used satire and forms of art to ridicule the president, there has been a negative reaction from officials. 
Some cartoons and AI-generated images, including showing the president in a casket, have been described as ""reckless"" and ""distasteful"".
Some of the alleged producers of this online content have been victims of abductions. This, Prof Manyora said, should be seen as a sign of intolerance by the government.
Lachon Kiplimo, a 23-year-old university student, said that while he supported the president, some of the promises he has made have been ""unrealistic"", which fuels the nicknames.
He cited the use of El Chapo, referring to the former Mexican drug lord, after Ruto promised a machine that would produce a million chapatis (also known as chapo in Kenya) every day to feed schoolchildren in the capital.
A chapati - a popular street food in Kenya - is also known as a chapo
Mr Kiplimo however reckons that the way the president brushes off the monikers, and in fact seems to embrace them, shows how strong he is.
Prof Manyora believes the young people who come up with the alternative labels for the president do it as a form of catharsis, a way of releasing tension. 
This view is backed up by 24-year-old student Margaret Wairimu Kahura, who said that many Kenyans ""are in a lot of pain"".
She feels that the mockery is a way of letting Ruto know how the youth are feeling. 
She says that no other Kenyan president has been subjected to this level of lampooning, and ""so this is unique [but] in a bad way"".
It is true that previous heads of state had nicknames but they have not been so numerous.
The last President, Uhuru Kenyatta, was called Kamwana (""young boy""), Jayden (a Kenyan reference to a pampered or lazy child) and Wamashati (for his love of print shirts).
His predecessor, Mwai Kibaki, was known as General Kiguoya (a general who is afraid) and Fence Sitter.
Perhaps the age of social media, with its insatiable appetite for new content to keep people amused, has increased the trend towards name calling.
But for many, like Ms Kahura, the volume of nicknames for Ruto are a genuine reflection of ""the different problems that people are facing"".

452,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp857gryxn1o,2025-05-13 23:16:32,"The heartbeat of a billion: What Virat Kohli meant to India,","Virat Kohli's retirement from Tests has left Indian cricket beleaguered and the sporting world gasping in surprise.
Coming on the heels of captain Rohit Sharma quitting a few days earlier, it adds up to a double whammy for India who embark on a tough tour of England for a five-Test series come June without their two most experienced batters.
Like Sharma, Kohli took to Instagram, where he commands more than 270 million followers, to make his retirement public.
""As I step away from this format, it's not easy â but it feels rightâ¦'' he explained to his disconsolate fans.
Tributes for Kohli have come in a deluge since: from fellow cricketers, past and present, old and young, and also legends from other disciplines like tennis ace Novak Djokovic and football star Harry Kane, which highlights the sweep and heft of Kohli's global appeal.
Leading India to victory in the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Kohli was fast tracked into international cricket by the then-chairman of selectors, former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar, against the judgement of others in the cricket establishment.
""Many in the Indian cricket board felt he was too young but he was scoring heavily in domestic cricket, and the hunger to succeed was palpable in him,"" recalls Vengsarkar.
An example of Kohli's obsessive passion for the sport comes imbued with poignancy. Kohli was playing his second Ranji Trophy match for Delhi. His father passed away suddenly with his team in a crisis. After the funeral, he went back and scored a battling 90.
Kohli bows out of Test cricket as one of the defining players of his generation
Vengsarkar's approving eye earned Kohli an ODI debut in 2009. At 23, he was the youngest member of India's 2011 ODI World Cup winning team under MS Dhoni. A few weeks later, he made his Test debut in the West Indies. Some months on, during the disastrous tour of Australia with his place under threat, Kohli made a gritty maiden century and never looked back. Within a couple of years he established himself as the pre-eminent batter of his generation.
Brash and provocative, without a benign muscle in his body, he was as volatile as potassium on water in his early years. He was unafraid to take on the most reputed opponents, often indulging in on-field fracases that sometimes earned him criticism.
Happily, this was not to become his defining identity in cricket. Prolific run-getting in dashing style across formats provided another more compelling dimension and was to take him to the pinnacle.
When his idol Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013, Kohli, allying unbridled ambition with his abundant skills, grabbed the baton hungrily and went on to sketch one of the most stellar careers in cricket history.
He wielded the bat like a Jedi, with great skill and telling thrust to slay opponents, as it were. Coupled with his high-octane persona, his scintillating batting made him a cult hero whose very presence ensured blockbuster box-office returns everywhere he played.
Kohli always wore his passion on his sleeve. He was always demonstrative and dramatic on the field but over a period of time, misplaced angst was sublimated into a raging inner pursuit of excellence that took him to dizzying heights. 
Marriage to film star Anushka Sharma made them the country's foremost power couple, putting both under the glare of even more intense spotlight.
Metaphorically, Kohli's outstanding exploits, especially in the first decade of his career, epitomised the emerging India of the 21st century: unabashedly, unrelentingly ambitious, discarding all past demons, willing to take on the best in the world.
His achievements across formats are monumental. 
In ODIs, he is third in run aggregate behind Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakarra, but boasts the best average (57.88) among batters who have played more than 100 games. His ability to win ODI matches in the most daunting run chases is the stuff of folklore, many of his record 51 centuries coming in such pursuit.
Kohli led the Indian team to victory in 2018-2019 Test series against Australia
In T20s, his run aggregate and centuries don't put him in the top five, but he's immortalised himself with incredible knocks, notably 82 not out in an emotion-charged, pulsating match against arch-rivals Pakistan in the 2022 World Cup and a vital 76 in the 2024 final against South Africa, which helped India win the title.
He is also the highest run scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League.
At one point, Kohli averaged 50-plus in all three formats, making him the most productive and versatile batter of his era - way ahead of contemporaries Joe Root, Kane Williamson and Steve Smith. The four were locked in a fascinating, long-running race for batting supremacy.
When it appeared he would break all batting records, Kohli's career took an inexplicable downturn. From the start of the pandemic, the flow of runs began to ebb and centuries became a trickle. In his pomp â between 2014 and 2019 â he had been unstoppable, at one time scoring six double centuries in just 18 months.
The drought of runs hit him most adversely in Test cricket where his average, from a high of 55-plus in 2019 slumped to the current 46.75. In this period, Kohli also lost the captaincy, though his stellar standing in international cricket remained untouched.
Kohli finishes his Test career with 9,230 runs, which puts him 19th overall in aggregate, and fourth among Indians behind Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar, all of whom finished with a 50-plus average and more centuries. But to judge him only on this yardstick would diminish the massive impact he has had on this format .
As captain, Kohli easily hurdles over Gavaskar, Tendulkar and Dravid. In Test cricket, winning 40 of the 68 matches he led in, making him the fourth most successful in the format. In the Indian context, this assumes Himalayan proportions.
Former Australia captain Greg Chappell says that Kohli's energy, grit, sense of purpose and aura was ""transformative"" for Indian cricket. Chappell marks him out as the most influential Indian captain, ahead of even Sourav Ganguly and M S Dhoni.
Former India captain and chief coach Ravi Shastri, who collaborated with Kohli for years, gives first-hand perspective. 
""Kohli made India into a fighting unit, especially when playing overseas,"" says Shastri.
Virat Kohli giving autographs to his fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
The lack of ICC and IPL titles according to Shastri, is misleading as an index to his  captaincy ability.
""He always played to win, sought and nurtured fast bowlers to win overseas, demanded high intent and supreme fitness from all players, putting himself in the forefront, not as a backseat driver.""
For seven years when Kohli and Shastri collaborated, India were in the top three in ICC rankings in all formats almost continuously which is unprecedented.
The most cherished and significant triumph of  this period came in 2018 when India beat Australia in its own backyard in a Test series for the first time ever.
Australia is where Kohli had launched himself into batting greatness, scoring 692 runs in four Tests in 2014-15. In 2018, he contributed as captain and batter to break an hitherto unassailable psychological barrier. In 2020 touring Australia, Kohli played only one match (which was lost) returning home for the birth of his child. But India, having overcome the mental barrier two years earlier, went on to win the rubber in a melodramatic see-saw series.
Australia was Kohli's happy hunting ground and his last visit Down Under in late 2024 grabbed worldwide attention. He began with a roar, hitting  a century in the first test at Perth. But his form fizzled out alarmingly and made only 190 runs in the five Tests.
How much this contributed to his decision to retire is moot. Advancing years, the dislike of being constantly under harsh scrutiny, wanting to be close to his young family and behind the scene shenanigans that abound in Indian cricket have doubtless played a part too.
Kohli ends his retirement post on Instagram enigmatically. 
""I'll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269 signing off,"" he wrote. 
The greatest ambassador for the five-day format in the last decade and a half had moved into the sunset.

The new cabinet of 28 ministers and 10 secretaries of state heralds some significant changes, including a new foreign minister to handle the US-Canada relationship. 
The reshuffle, two weeks after the election, brings some familiar names as well as political newcomers - a team ""purpose-built for this hinge moment"", Carney told reporters.
There are 24 new faces in cabinet, including 13 first-time MPs. Several veterans of former PM Justin Trudeau's government, such as Melanie Joly and Chrystia Freeland, return to cabinet.
Other holdovers from the Trudeau era include Anita Anand, Gary Anandasangaree, Sean Fraser and Dominic LeBlanc.
But housing, immigration and energy - key departments for which the Trudeau government was heavily criticised - have been given to first-time ministers.
Carney is also continuing Trudeau's policy of maintaining gender parity in his cabinet. 
""Canada's new ministry is built to deliver the change Canadians want and deserve,""  Carney said on Tuesday.
He has made a number of changes to the core team of ministers handling the strained relationship with the US.
It comes after Carney recently met Trump at the White House, after which he said the US leader was willing to negotiate a new trade deal.
Veteran member of parliament (MP), Dominic LeBlanc, who has overseen a number of cabinet positions, most recently international trade, will now focus on Canada-US trade and breaking down internal trade barriers within the country - a key campaign pledge. 
Toronto-area MP Maninder Sidhu, takes over as minister of international trade. 
Carney has also named a new foreign minister, Anita Anand, who held a number of top roles in Trudeau's cabinet, including defence. 
Melanie Joly was shuffled out of foreign affairs and given the industry portfolio. 
Former justice minister Gary Anandasangaree now takes on the role of public safety, a department that will oversee border security, which Trump has cited as a key reason for imposing tariffs on Canada as well as Mexico. 
David McGuinty, who previously held that position, now oversees defence. 
Two prominent names have been pushed out of the cabinet - Bill Blair, who oversaw defence, and Jonathan Wilkinson, natural resources minister. 
Rookie MP Tim Hodgson, first elected in April, is taking over at natural resources. Carney worked with him at the Bank of Canada, where Hodgson served as a special adviser.

Canada has been 'over reliant on the US for too long', says Joly
The 10 secretaries of state will assist the senior ministers on key portfolios.
Some notable names remaining in their roles include Francois-Philippe Champagne, who stays on as finance minister, a position he has held since March. 
Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister under Trudeau and a former foreign affairs and finance minister in his government, stays in transport. 
Steven Guilbeault will continue to oversee Canadian culture and official languages.
Federal cabinets in Canada by tradition balance representation of the country's regional, linguistic and ethnic diversity.
The new cabinet includes representation from Canada's prairie provinces - a minister and secretary of state - where there are growing musings about separation amid a broader sense of western alienation from the power centre in Ottawa. 
Some of the new faces include former broadcaster Evan Solomon, who will be minister of artificial intelligence and digital innovation.
Toronto MP Julie Dabrusin joins cabinet for the first time as environment minister after having served as parliamentary secretary for the file since 2021. 
Halifax MP Lena Metlege Diab is also new to cabinet in the role of minister for immigration.
Vancouver's former mayor, Gregor Robertson, takes on a significant role overseeing housing. Carney has pledged to significantly ramp up construction amid a housing affordability crisis in Canada.  
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre criticised Carney for keeping so many ministers who served in Trudeau's cabinet. 
""That isn't the change that Mr Carney promised,"" he said."

After months of delays, a judge is hearing arguments both for and against Erik and Lyle Menendez's bid to receive a lesser sentence - which could ultimately lead to their paroled release.
Prosecutors have argued the brothers meticulously planned the 1989 killings to access their parents' fortune, still have not taken accountability and should not be released. The brothers have said they acted out of self-defence after years of abuse and have been rehabilitated.
The notorious case, which has prompted books, documentaries and dramas, still divides America.
The brothers appeared virtually for the hearing, both wearing bright blue shirts and sitting in the same room. At the start of the hearing, they appeared upbeat and smiled, even waving to their legal team.
The court heard relatives detail how the case impacted their family, and pleading for the judge to allow Erik and Lyle's release from prison.
The district attorney's office is set to oppose the resentencing application, which is scheduled to continue being heard on Wednesday.
The brothers' cousin, Anamaria Baralt, who has been close with them since they were children, told the judge they deserved a ""second chance at life"". 
""It's been a nightmare,"" she said of the decades-long saga. ""I am desperate for this process to be over.""
At times, both Erik and Lyle appeared emotional as family recounted how their crimes have impacted them. Both wiped their eyes at times, with Erik covering his mouth or putting his head in his hands at other moments. 
Ms Baralt speaks with Erik and Lyle frequently, she told the court, and testified about their growth, submitting that they've taken ""ownership of their actions"". She said they admitted they tried to steer their previous trial - with Lyle telling her he'd asked a witness to lie when testifying.
""They are very different men from the boys they were,"" she said.
The brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television
Ms Baralt told the court that some family members were in bad health and wanted to be reunited with the brothers.
""We're on borrowed time,"" she said, turning to the judge with tears in her eyes. ""I pray that you will help us.""
Ms Baralt noted how nearly every member of their family is in support of their release. The lone family member who publicly opposed their resentencing bid - the brothers' uncle Milton Andersen - recently passed away. 
Mr Andersen previously called Erik and Lyle ""cold-blooded"" and said their ""actions shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades.""
In a statement released by his lawyer months before his passing, Mr Andersen said his nephews should stay in prison for their ""heinous act"".
Along with three family members, the judge also heard from a retired Florida judge - who said he has never testified on behalf of any criminal defendant - and Anerae ""X-Raided"" Brown, a rapper who served in prison with both brothers and credits for helping with his release.
The court was told about schooling both brothers completed while in prison and programs they launched behind bars to inmates create a better life.
The district attorney's office, which is vehemently opposed to the brothers being released, questioned each witness about Erik and Lyle's history of lies about the murders. 
The crux of much of their opposition sits on the issue of rehabilitation. Prosecutors have said the brothers have continued to ""make excuses"" for their conduct instead of taking full accountability. 
""There's no doubt they've done all these positive things in prison,"" Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian said in his closing arguments. 
But, he added, when reversing a jury's unanimous verdict in such a brutal murder case, it's important to ""make certain they are truly rehabilitated.""
Outside the courthouse, television crews blocked sidewalks, symbolic of the immense interest in the case.
Before proceedings started, more than a dozen members of the public gathered hoping to secure yellow badges get inside the courtroom - a highly sought after ticket given the hearing is not being streamed or televised.
Elena Gordon, who nabbed a ticket, remembers watching the divisive case as a girl on television. She travelled from Orange County, California, multiple times to attend hearings as the brothers' resentencing bid was delayed again and again. 
""I feel like this is just a historical moment - both for our area and for such a big case,"" Ms Gordon said, wearing her golden ticket in an elevator on her way to the courtroom. ""It's a big day.""
At the end of the hearing, the judge is expected to determine whether the brothers, who were sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole, should receive a lesser sentence. 
Instead of testifying as part of the hearing, the brothers plan to address the court with a statement read aloud, their attorney told the court. This might prevent them from being questioned by prosecutors as part of cross examination. The BBC has asked who else might testify. 
""I know right now that I'm going to put family members on the stand,"" Mr Geragos said on his podcast of his plans for the hearing. ""I know right now, I'll put correctional officers on the stand. I know right now I may put behavioural scientists on the stand.""
The district attorney's office has not said who it plans to call to testify.
Three possible paths to freedom: What's next for the Menendez brothers?
What to know about the Menendez brothers resentencing hearing
The hearing will not be a re-trial and the brothers' guilt will not be questioned. 
Instead, much of the focus is likely to be on what they have done during their 30 years in prison and whether they have been rehabilitated.
During their trials, prosecutors painted them as entitled and eager to access their parents' $14m (Â£10.7m) fortune. 
They argued that the duo methodically planned the killings, buying shotguns and opening fire on their parents 13 times as the couple watched TV - before going gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees.
The brothers ultimately admitted to the killings, but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father Jose, a high-powered film and record label executive.
The brothers' trial in 1993 was one of the first high-profile murder cases to be shown live on television, gripping audiences in the US and globally.

Family of Menendez brothers call for their release in killing of parents
Their first trial ended in a deadlock, but in 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in a retrial. Many of their claims of sexual abuse were not allowed as part of the proceedings.  
The hearing comes after a Netflix drama thrust the case back into the spotlight, and support for resentencing them has notably come from the previous Los Angeles District Attorney George GascÃ³n. 
His replacement, Nathan Hochman, has vehemently opposed the brothers' efforts to be freed and argued they have not ""demonstrated true accountability"" and instead have clung to a litany of ""lies"" about the case."

A masked gang have tried to abduct the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency chief in Paris, but after a violent struggle they drove off empty-handed.
The botched kidnap bid was captured on video by an onlooker in Paris's 11th district, in the east of the French capital.
Police sources said the woman was the daughter of a cryptocurrency company boss. She and her husband fought off three attackers until passers-by rushed to their aid and the men fled in a van.
A Paris police brigade that tackles armed robbery is expected to investigate the attack, which is the latest in a series of abductions targeting French cryptocurrency figures or their relatives. 
The attack unfolded at about 08:20 local time on Tuesday, according to local media, when three men leapt from a white van and tried to kidnap the mother and her child.
The pair are described as relatives of the co-founder of French Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, the AFP news agency said.
The woman's husband who was with his family at the time tried to protect them and was beaten repeatedly over the head. The couple shouted for help as the masked men tried to pull them apart.
At one point she was seen to grab a firearm off the attacker and throw it into the street. The weapon was later described as a replica air gun.
The street was relatively busy at the time and a group of children were on their way to a local primary school.
Initially, passers-by appeared too afraid to intervene, but as locals began to react the three attackers eventually gave up and jumped into the van as a fourth gang member drove them away. One man hurled a fire extinguisher at the van as it sped off.
The family were treated for minor injuries in hospital.
The botched kidnapping in the Rue Pache came little more than a week after French police rescued the father of a cryptocurrency millionaire who had been kidnapped in another area of the capital while walking his dog and held for ransom.
In an indication of the brutality of the gangs involved, the victim was freed three days later after his kidnappers had cut off one of his fingers.
Several people were arrested.
Last January, David Balland, co-founder of cryptocurrency wallet firm Ledger, was abducted with his wife at their home in central France.
French media say the victim had one finger missing when he was rescued from a house in Palaiseau, south of Paris."

An Israeli air strike has killed 28 people and injured dozens at the European Hospital in Khan Younis, a spokesman for the Hamas-run civil defence agency has said.
Israeli warplanes dropped six bombs simultaneously on the Gaza hospital, hitting both its inner courtyard and surrounding area, according to local sources.
The Israeli military said it had conducted a ""precise strike"" on ""Hamas terrorists in a command and control centre"" which it claimed was beneath the hospital.
A freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza was among those injured in the air strike, and is now in a stable condition after receiving medical attention.
Gaza journalist Hassan Aslih killed in Israeli strike on hospital
The force of the strikes at European Hospital left craters and partially buried a bus
The strike at European Hospital resulted in several deep craters inside the hospital compound, which buried several vehicles including part of a large bus.
Eyewitnesses said Israeli drones maintained a tight aerial siege over the building, preventing rescue teams from reaching the site.
A quadcopter drone reportedly wounded two civil defence officers as they attempted to approach the European Hospital. 
Dr Tom Potokar, a plastic surgeon working with the Ideals international aid charity, was in the hospital when it was hit.
Speaking to the BBC's Newshour programme, he described ""six enormous explosions one after the other"" that directly hit the hospital with ""no warning whatsoever"". 
""There was complete panic,"" he added.
The dead and wounded have been transferred to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, local sources said, where medical teams are reportedly struggling to deal with the casualties. 
The emergency department of Nasser Hospital was hit by another strike earlier on Tuesday, according to medical sources and eyewitnesses. 
They said a well-known Palestinian photojournalist was among two people killed.
Hassan Aslih, who was being treated for injuries from a previous Israeli strike, was targeted in what witnesses described as a drone attack on the hospital's surgical wing.
A doctor there confirmed that Aslih had been at the hospital for nearly a month after surviving an air strike on the same facility in April.
The Israeli military had previously accused him of involvement in the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. The strike in April killed Aslih's colleague Helmi al-Faqawi and wounded several other journalists.
In a joint statement the IDF and the Israeli Securities Authority (ISA) said Hamas ""continues"" to use hospitals in Gaza for its activities - a long-standing Israeli allegation which the group denies.
Israeli media reported the target of the strike was senior Hamas figure Mohammed Sinwar - the younger brother of the former Hamas leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar.
Hamas has not commented on these reports.
Mohammed Sinwar is believed to have taken command of the group's military wing, following the death of Mohammed Deif in an Israeli strike last summer. 
Separately on Tuesday evening, the Israel army said it intercepted ""two projectiles"" launched from Gaza. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad has claimed responsibility and said it shot rocket fire from Gaza at Israel.

President Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US has sparked a Supreme Court legal challenge along with anxiety among immigrant families.
For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen.
But as part of his crackdown on migration numbers, Trump is seeking to deny citizenship to children of migrants who are either in the country illegally or on temporary visas. 
The move appears to have public backing. A January poll by Emerson College suggests, external many more Americans back Trump than oppose him on this. 
But how does this compare to citizenship laws around the world?
Birthright citizenship, or jus soli (right of the soil), is not the norm globally.
The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.
In contrast, many countries in Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa adhere to the jus sanguinis (right of blood) principle, where children inherit their nationality from their parents, regardless of their birthplace. 
Other countries have a combination of both principles, also granting citizenship to children of permanent residents.
John Skrentny, a sociology professor at the University of California, San Diego, believes that, though birthright citizenship or jus soli is common throughout the Americas, ""each nation-state had its own unique road to it"".
""For example, some involved slaves and former slaves, some did not. History is complicated,"" he says. In the US, the 14th Amendment was adopted to address the legal status of freed slaves.
However, Mr Skrentny argues that what almost all had in common was ""building a nation-state from a former colony"".
""They had to be strategic about whom to include and whom to exclude, and how to make the nation-state governable,"" he explains. ""For many, birthright citizenship, based on being born in the territory, made for their state-building goals.
""For some, it encouraged immigration from Europe; for others, it ensured that indigenous populations and former slaves, and their children, would be included as full members, and not left stateless. It was a particular strategy for a particular time, and that time may have passed.""
In recent years, several countries have revised their citizenship laws, tightening or revoking birthright citizenship due to concerns over immigration, national identity, and so-called ""birth tourism"" where people visit a country in order to give birth.
India, for example, once granted automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil. But over time, concerns over illegal immigration, particularly from Bangladesh, led to restrictions.
Since December 2004, a child born in India is only a citizen if both parents are Indian, or if one parent is a citizen and the other is not considered an illegal migrant.
Many African nations, which historically followed jus soli under colonial-era legal systems, later abandoned it after gaining independence. Today, most require at least one parent to be a citizen or a permanent resident.
Citizenship is even more restrictive in most Asian countries, where it is primarily determined by descent, as seen in nations such as China, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Europe has also seen significant changes. Ireland was the last country in the region to allow unrestricted jus soli. 
It abolished the policy after a June 2004 poll, when 79% of voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring at least one parent to be a citizen, permanent resident, or legal temporary resident. 
The government said change was needed because foreign women were travelling to Ireland to give birth in order to get an EU passport for their babies.
Rights groups had feared a constitutional court ruling in the Dominican Republic would strip tens of thousands of citizenship, mostly of Haitian descent
One of the most severe changes occurred in the Dominican Republic, where, in 2010, a constitutional amendment redefined citizenship to exclude children of undocumented migrants.
A 2013 Supreme Court ruling made this retroactive to 1929, stripping tens of thousands - mostly of Haitian descent - of their Dominican nationality. Rights groups warned that this could leave many stateless, as they did not have Haitian papers either.
The move was widely condemned by international humanitarian organisations and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.
As a result of the public outcry, the Dominican Republic passed a law in 2014 that established a system to grant citizenship to Dominican-born children of immigrants, particularly favouring those of Haitian descent.
Mr Skrentny sees the changes as part of a broader global trend. ""We are now in an era of mass migration and easy transportation, even across oceans. Now, individuals also can be strategic about citizenship. That's why we are seeing this debate in the US now.""
President Trump's executive order is already facing a Supreme Court legal challenge
Within hours of President Trump's order, various lawsuits were launched by Democratic-run states and cities, civil rights groups and individuals.
Three federal judges have ruled against Trump, issuing nationwide injunctions to block the orders from taking effect. 
Most legal scholars agree that President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.
Trump has asked the Supreme Court to narrow the injunctions to only apply to the named defendants in the cases - a request the justices will weigh at a hearing on15 May. 
It is unclear how the Supreme Court, where conservative justices form a supermajority,  would interpret the 14th Amendment if it came to it. 
Trump's justice department has argued it only applies to permanent residents. Diplomats, for example, are exempt.
But others counter that other US laws apply to undocumented migrants so the 14th Amendment should too."

The potential move has been labelled ""wildly illegal"" by some members of the rival Democratic Party - something the White House denies - and it has attracted criticism from some of Trump's supporters.
Qatar itself earlier said the reports about the plane were ""inaccurate"", and that negotiations were continuing.
The news comes as Trump visits several countries in the Middle East, including Qatar.
BBC Verify has been looking into the legality of presidents accepting gifts.
On Sunday, US media reported that the Trump administration was preparing to accept a Boeing jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family - saying that the plane would be refitted and used temporarily as Air Force One, the name for the plane used by presidents.
Trump later posted on Truth Social, external: ""The Defense Department is getting a gift, free of charge, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction.""
When questioned by reporters, Trump said: ""It's a great gesture from Qatar. I appreciate it very much. I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer.""
In February, Trump said he was ""not happy with Boeing"" about delays to two new Air Force One jets that he is expecting to receive directly from the firm. He added that the White House could instead ""buy a plane or get a plane, or something"".
Trump toured the plane in Palm Beach back in February
The Qatari plane was pictured in Palm Beach, Florida, in February where Trump inspected it. It is currently fitted with three bedrooms, a private lounge and an office, according to its specification summary document from 2015.
A Qatari official has told CNN, external the plane is being given from the Qatari defence ministry to the Pentagon, and that it will be modified to meet Air Force One's safety and security standards.
Experts say this is likely to take years, which means the plane may not be ready for use until near the end of Trump's term.
Trump has said the plane will go directly to his presidential library after he leaves office, and that he ""wouldn't be using it"" after his presidency.
Nonetheless, the move has led to criticism from Democrats as well as some long-time Trump supporters, including Laura Loomer who said: ""This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true.""
Several senior Democrats have claimed that accepting the gift would be illegal.
Democratic Senator Adam Schiff quoted a section of the US Constitution, external that said no elected official could accept ""any present... of any kind whatever"" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval.
Frank Cogliano, a professor of American history at the University of Edinburgh, says this clause ""was intended to prevent bribery to influence the government"".
""It is certainly stretching the Constitution and we have not seen a gift on this scale, or of this nature"", says Professor Andrew Moran, a constitutional law expert at London Metropolitan University.
Ronald Regan's Air Force One, the Boeing 707, was moved to his presidential library in 2003
There have been a number of other laws passed by Congress relating to the acceptance of foreign gifts, such as the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act of 1966, which means that congressional consent is required for the acceptance of foreign gifts above a certain value.
Currently US officials can accept gifts valued at less than $480 (Â£363), external.
Although Trump has referred to the plane ultimately going to his ""library"", experts have suggested he really means his museum foundation.
Ex-presidents typically have a library housing their archive of documents, and a museum - typically funded by private donations - full of memorabilia and open to the public.
Experts who BBC Verify spoke to said the fact that the plane could be given to the administration - and not to the president directly - before being transferred to his museum, may not get around the potential violation of the constitution.
Karoline Leavitt said any donation was always received in full compliance with the law
Jordan Libowitz - from the organisation Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington - said any use of the plane by Trump after leaving office would cross a line: ""Reagan's Air Force One ended up in his presidential library, but there's a difference there. The plane was decommissioned, Reagan never flew on it again, and it sits inside as a museum piece.""
The US Justice Department has reportedly drafted a memo explaining why it thinks accepting the jet would be permissible, although this has not been made public.
When the White House Press Secretary, Karoline Leavitt was asked about the legality of the deal, she said: ""The legal details of that are still being worked out, but of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law.""
President Trump is on a four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE, hoping to drum up investment for the US.
His visit follows a series of business deals announced by the Trump Organization, which is run by the president's sons, Eric and Donald Jr.
These include plans to build golf courses and luxury villas in Qatar and the UAE.
President Trump is not currently affiliated with the Trump Organization, having handed over management responsibilities to his children after entering the White House on 20 January.
Eric Trump was in Dubai on 1 May
A deal was announced by the Trump Organization, external at the beginning of May to develop a Trump-branded luxury 18-hole golf course and a collection of luxury villas north of Qatar's capital, Doha.
At the time, Eric Trump said: ""We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global.""
Dar Global is a publicly owned Saudi construction company; Qatari Diar is a Qatari state-owned company.
Separately, on 30 April, the Trump Organization announced, external it would build ""the region's first Trump International Hotel & Tower"" in the ""heart of Dubai"" consisting of 80 floors of ""luxury living and world-class hospitality"".

In one of his first acts as the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending automatic citizenship rights for nearly anyone born on US territory - known as ""birthright citizenship"".
It's a policy change he's long promised - but implementing it won't be easy. After multiple legal challenges blocked the order from taking effect, the Supreme Court is now due to consider the case on Thursday.
Trump's order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or on temporary visas. 
Most legal scholars say the president doesn't have the power to unilaterally change the law in this area, which is based on an amendment in the US Constitution.
The first sentence of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution establishes the principle of birthright citizenship:
""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.""
Immigration hardliners argue that the policy, external is a ""great magnet for illegal immigration"" and that it encourages pregnant women to cross the border in order to give birth and remain in the US, an act that has been pejoratively called ""birth tourism"" or having an ""anchor baby"".
Supporters of birthright citizenship point out that it has been the law of the land for well over a century and that eliminating it would create, external a ""permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans.""
The concept of birthright citizenship, also known by the legal term ""jus soli"", is based in English common law and was generally accepted to apply to white men throughout early American history.
However, it did not become part of the Constitution until 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.
Previous Supreme Court cases, like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, had determined that African Americans could never be US citizens. The 14th Amendment overrode that.
In 1898, the US Supreme Court ruled that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of US v Wong Kim Ark. 
Wong was a 24-year-old child of legal Chinese immigrants who was born in the US, but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US, his parents' immigration status did not affect the application of the 14th Amendment.
The court ruled in Wong's favour and outlined a few limited exceptions to birthright citizenship, such as for children of diplomats.
""Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one's parents, all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered,"" writes Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. ""The court has not re-examined this issue since then.""
Most legal scholars say President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.
""He's doing something that's going to upset a lot of people, but ultimately this will be decided by the courts,"" said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. ""This is not something he can decide on his own.""
Mr Prakash said that while the president can order employees of federal agencies to interpret citizenship more narrowly - agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example - that would trigger legal challenges from anyone whose citizenship is denied.
The Trump administration's arguments rest on the clause in the 14th Amendment that reads ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"".  It argues that the language excludes children of non-citizens who are in the US unlawfully.
Courts have generally disagreed. In Plyler v Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case involving a different part of the 14th Amendment, justices rejected an argument made by the state of Texas, external that undocumented immigrants were not ""persons within its jurisdiction"". The court ruled that migrants are both subject to US laws and granted the protections afforded by them.
A constitutional amendment could do away with birthright citizenship, but that would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and approval by three quarters of US states - a virtual impossibility on such a controversial proposal, given the current finely balanced divide in American politics.
According to Pew Research, external, about 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, which is a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007. By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.
But as those children also have children, the cumulative effect of ending birthright citizenship could potentially increase the number of unauthorised immigrants in the country to 4.7m in 2050, the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, found.
In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said he thought the children of unauthorised immigrants should be deported alongside their parents - even if they were born in the US.
""I don't want to be breaking up families,"" Trump said last December. ""So the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.""
Trump has now taken the case to the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, after lower courts ruled against his plans. Arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard on 15 May. 
Judges in district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state have issued nationwide injunctions, blocking Trump's order from being carried out.
John Coughenour, a judge in Seattle, called it ""blatantly unconstitutional"". 
The Trump administration is now taking those injunctions to the Supreme Court, and arguing that federal judges should be more limited in how they can block federal policy. Specifically, the administration only wants the injunctions to apply to people named in the case.
If the Supreme Court does limit the scope of judges' orders to just those migrants, then the administration could remove protections for all migrants not specifically named.
This would allow Trump's executive order to go into effect, without the court ruling on the constitutionality of presidential the order itself.

A US court has slashed the $18m (Â£13.6m) awarded to Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas in a defamation case to $500.
Former Ghanaian MP Kennedy Agyapong was ordered to pay the huge sum after a jury found he had defamed Anas by calling him a ""criminal"", and of being behind the murder of a fellow journalist.
Following a request by Agyapong's legal team for the amount to be reduced, a judge in a New Jersey court has ruled that $18m was ""disproportionate and legally unsustainable"",  the former MP said on X.
Anas said he would appeal against the ruling, despite his Tiger Eye P.I. media group previously saying that the case was never about money.
The journalist began legal action against Agyapong after the ex-MP made the defamatory remarks following his investigation into football corruption in Ghana and elsewhere.
Anas had filed an initial case in Ghana where he lost, with the judge describing his work not as journalism but as ""investigative terrorism"".
He subsequently brought a different case before a court in the US, where Agyapong owns a home and where the ex-MP was when he recorded the defamatory interview on the Daddy Fred Show podcast, according to court papers. 
Agyapong's lawyers had argued that their client's comments were simply opinions and therefore should not be subject to defamation.
However, the eight-panel jury in New Jersey's Essex County Superior Court disagreed, ruling unanimously in Anas' favour in March.
At the time, he told the BBC the ruling was a ""vindication of what I have always preached"". 
""This goes a long way to encourage African journalists across the continent there's a need for us to be resilient. There's a need for us to have a stomach to take the heat,"" Anas said.
After succeeding in his attempt to reduce the defamation award, Agyapong has committed himself to ""upholding the values of integrity"" and defending ""truth and accountability in public life"".
The journalist is well known for masking his identity by wearing beaded face coverings.
He has also won multiple international awards for his reporting and has vowed to continue fighting corruption and holding wrongdoers accountable.
Ahmed Suale, an investigative journalist who was shot dead in 2019, was a colleague of Anas who had also investigated corruption and had worked with Tiger Eye P.I..
Anas has previously told the BBC that he was still grieving the death of his former colleague.

A British tourist is facing deportation from Israel after allegedly entering a closed military area and threatening security forces, Israeli authorities say.
Janet Adyeri, 35, who was named by Israeli media, was detained in the Southern Hebron Hills area in the occupied West Bank on Monday.
After being questioned she was found to have posted anti-Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sentiments on social media and to belong to an organisation calling for the boycott of Israel, police said.
Israel's immigration authority said Adyeri would be kept in a detention centre, and is expected to be deported within the next 24 hours.
According to Israeli police, Adyeri ""violated public order by refusing to identify herself to the forces and threatening a settlement security coordinator"".
Following an investigation at the Central Unit of Judea and Samaria, Adyeri was brought before a judge, police said. 
Adyeri's lawyer Riham Nasra said her client was not interrogated about her social media posts or making threats. 
She told Israeli media she was only ""questioned regarding her entry into a closed military zone, and that's it"".
Nasra added that Adyeri only refused to identify herself when asked by a plainclothes soldier.
She presented identification to uniformed soldiers later on.
According to Israeli media, Nasra disputes Adyeri was brought before a judge, as police claimed. 
She was taken straight to a hearing at the Population and Immigration Authority in Ramle, where her deportation was decided upon, the lawyer said. 
After the incident, Israel's national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said in a post on X that anyone ""who acts against the State of Israel will find an aggressive police presence,"" adding, ""the games are over.""
Last month, two Labour MPs were denied entry to Israel while on a trip to the occupied West Bank. 
Israel's population and immigration authority said this was because they intended to ""spread hate speech"". 
A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said: ""We are supporting a British woman who is detained in Israel and are in contact with the local authorities."""

Three Belgian soldiers have been injured in a live firing incident during a military training exercise in Scotland.
Belgium's defence ministry said approximately 10 other soldiers also sustained hearing damage.
The Scottish Ambulance Service said two helicopters and three ambulances formed part of its response to the incident at Tain, in Easter Ross, at about 13:15 on Monday.
Tain is the location of a large weapons training area where aircraft and ground troops conduct live firing exercises.
Police Scotland said it was alerted to an incident involving military personnel at 13:25 on Monday and inquiries were ongoing.
It is understood about 600 Belgian personnel are based at Kinloss Barracks in Moray during a large-scale exercise called Red Condor.
It is taking place until 21 May and involves military helicopters, according to the UK Ministry of Defence, external.
Two of the injured soldiers are now in a stable condition, with one expected to undergo surgery in Scotland before being repatriated to Belgium.
The third soldier who went to hospital sustained minor injuries and has since been discharged. 
A spokesman for Belgium's defence ministry said: ""The incident took place during a planned training exercise. An investigation has been launched to determine the exact circumstances.
""The families of the injured personnel have been informed.""
The Belgian prime minister Bart De Wever posted on X that he had been informed that three members of the Third Parachute Battalion had been injured. 
He wished them a speedy recovery and offered his sympathies to their loved ones.
A spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defence said: ""We are aware of an incident during an exercise in Scotland involving foreign national military personnel. 
""Our thoughts are with all those affected.""
The Scottish Ambulance Service said one of its own air ambulances and a helicopter from Scotland's Charity Air Ambulance were sent to the incident.
Trauma teams and a doctor also responded to the incident.
An ambulance spokesperson said: ""Two patients were transported by air to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and one patient by road to Raigmore Hospital.""
Tain Air Weapons Range covers an area of 2,700 acres on the Dornoch Firth.
It is used by the UK military, US Air Force and Nato personnel.
Hampshire-born L/Cpl Joe Spencer, of 3rd Battalion The Rifles, died in an accident at the range on 1 November 2016.
An inquiry into his death heard that, as a group of snipers gathered in a shipping container on the range, the 24-year-old was resting his chin on a suppressor fitted to his rifle's muzzle when the gun fired unexpectedly.
Sheriff Gary Aitken, who led the inquiry, said his death could have been avoided if precautions had been taken."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will travel to Turkey's capital Ankara to meet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and will be available for direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Istanbul on Thursday.
""We will do everything to ensure that this meeting takes place,"" he told reporters in a hastily-arranged briefing in Kyiv.
Russia has not yet said who will fly to Istanbul, only that it would be announced ""as soon as [Putin] deems it necessary"". Putin and Zelensky have not themselves met since December 2019.
Direct talks between the two countries last took place in Istanbul, in March 2022, in the early weeks of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Putin had initially called for direct talks in Turkey's largest city ""without pre-conditions"", before Zelensky announced that he would go in person and expected the Russian president to travel as well.
The US is also expected to send a high-level delegation.
By confirming his visit to Turkey at Tuesday's briefing, Zelensky clearly sought to intensify pressure on Russia to respond. The Kremlin has already warned that exerting pressure on Moscow is ""useless"" and it does not respond to ultimatums.
Russia has instead sought to focus on a long-term settlement that tackles what Moscow sees as the ""root causes"" of the war - a set of tough pre-conditions announced before the 2022 invasion and repeatedly rejected by Kyiv.
The Ukrainian leader said while he was prepared to meet Putin in Istanbul his priority was to secure a 30-day ceasefire, which he said all Ukraine's allies - including the US - were agreed on.
Zelensky said he believed Putin's late night offer on Sunday for direct talks in Turkey was designed to catch Kyiv out, so that he would ""not react"" or ""react in a negative way for Ukraine"".
US President Donald Trump, who is on a visit to the Gulf, has hinted that he could fly to to Istanbul himself ""if I think things can happen"".
That seems unlikely for now, and unconfirmed reports suggest two senior US envoys, Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, are planning to be in Istanbul on the day.
The Kremlin has sought to dampen speculation that Putin himself might himself go. 
 ""Russia continues preparations for the negotiations due on Thursday. That's all that can be said right now,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Tuesday that Moscow was prepared to hold talks ""responsibly"" taking into account ""realities on the ground"" - in a veiled reference to Ukraine's four south-eastern regions partially seized by Russia since 2022.
He also repeated Moscow's initial pre-invasion demands for a settlement to be achieved - Ukraine and its Western allies see this as an ultimatum tantamount to Kyiv's de facto capitulation.
Ryabkov also cast doubt on Ukraine's ability to stick to agreements.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it would be a good move for Zelensky and Putin to sit down and talk, but added: ""I don't think he dares, Putin.""
Zelensky also accused Putin of ""being scared"" to meet him. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said if the Russian leader refused to go to Istanbul it would the ""final signal"" that he did not want to end the war.
The leaders of Ukraine's main allies - the UK, Germany, Poland and France - travelled to Kyiv at the weekend to warn of immediate further sanctions if Russia did not accept a 30-day ceasefire. 
The European Union is currently working on a 17th package of measures."

The 55-year-old was arrested last September and faces charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.
Dozens of prospective jurors were screened before being whittled down to 12 - and six alternates.
The first week of testimony will include two witnesses who are expected to speak briefly, prosecutors said, followed by a third witness who will see more time on the stand.
Mr Combs also faces dozens of civil lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people. He has said the individual lawsuits are attempts ""for a quick payday"".
The court is expected to be open to the public, but proceedings will not be televised or streamed online.
Cameras, phones and electronic devices are normally not allowed in US federal courtrooms.
The trial proceedings began in early May with jury selection at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in lower Manhattan.
US District Judge Arun Subramanian told jurors the trial could last around eight weeks. 
Dozens of potential jurors were vetted by the court. 
The process included potential jurors looking through a long list of places and people that could be mentioned during trial, with names like Kanye West and Kid Cudi. 
The ""People and Places"" list was so long that Judge Subramanian said he ""felt like I was reading an appendix for Lord of the Rings"".
Potential jurors also had to fill out questionnaires that asked whether they had ""views about hip hop artists"" or ""feelings concerning violence, sexual assault"".   
The judge reminded the court several times of the importance of choosing a fair and impartial jury. 
Nearly all the potential jurors had read news reports of the allegations in the case and many had seen footage of Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura in a hotel hallway. 
In the federal criminal case being heard in New York, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.  
Many of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.
This includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.
In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as âfreak offsâ, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.
Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.
Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US had either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or intended to do so.
In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was ""gang raped"" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given ""copious amounts of drugs and alcohol"" before the attack. 
Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as ""clear attempts to garner publicity.""
Sean Combs and Cassie Ventura were in an on-and-off relationship for more than a decade
Mr Combs' current legal issues began in late 2023 when he was sued by Ms Ventura, also known as Cassie, for violent abuse and rape. 
That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.
Since then, dozens of other people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all the claims. 
His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CNN leaked CCTV footage from 2016 showing Mr Combs kicking his ex-girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor. 
He apologised for his behaviour, saying: ""I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.""

Diddy's violence left me broken, says Cassie
In a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, Mr Combs' lawyer said: ""In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.""
Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss one part of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.
In a hearing in New York a week before the trial officially began, his attorneys told the court that the rapper led the ""lifestyle"" of a ""swinger"" and was not a criminal. 
They said he thought it was ""appropriate"" to have multiple sex partners, including sex workers. 
At the same hearing, prosecutors revealed that Mr Combs had rejected a plea deal. 
Mr Combs' lawyers have consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as ""sickening"" and suggesting they were made by ""individuals looking for a quick payday"".
Mr Combs has been held at this Brooklyn jail
If convicted on the racketeering charge, Mr Combs faces up to life in prison. 
He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.
Transportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years.
Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.
Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence. 
His lawyers argued for his release, citing the jailâs âhorrificâ conditions, but a New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a âserious flight riskâ.
Prosecutors previously alleged that Mr Combs had broken prison rules by contacting potential witnesses. 
They accused him of ""relentless efforts"" to ""corruptly influence witness testimony"".
A judge granted Mr Combs permission to wear non-prison clothing during his trial rather than the jumpsuits he wears in jail. 
When he appeared in court for jury selection, the rapper wore a blue sweater and white shirt with glasses on his head. 

Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged in the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.
His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or The Notorious B.I.G.
His music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.
Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand CÃ®roc.
In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.

A self-declared ""king"" of Germany and three of his senior ""subjects"" have been arrested and their group banned for attempting to overthrow the state.
Peter Fitzek, 59, was among those arrested in morning raids across seven states on Tuesday, which involved about 800 security personnel.
The government banned their group, the ReichsbÃ¼rger, or ""citizens of the Reich"", which seeks to establish the KÃ¶nigreich Deutschland, or ""Kingdom of Germany"".
Alexander Dobrindt, German's interior minister, accused the group of attempting to ""undermine the rule of law"" by creating an alternative state and spreading ""antisemitic conspiracy narratives to back up their supposed claim to authority"".
His ministry announced the dissolution of the group, and accused it of financing itself through ""economic criminal structures"".
Fitzek, a former chef and karate instructor, calls himself ""king"" and identified himself to judges as ""Peter the First"" in a previous court case. 
He had himself crowned in 2012 while dressed in ermine robes and brandishing a medieval sword. Since then he has been buying land and property across Germany. 
ReichsbÃ¼rgers have their own currency, flag and ID cards, and want to set up separate banking and health systems. 
Fitzek claims to have thousands of followers - or ""subjects"".
In an interview with the BBC in 2022 he denied having any violent intentions, but also described the German state as ""destructive and sick"". 
""I have no interest in being part of this fascist and satanic system,"" he told the BBC's Jenny Hill, when she visited his ""kingdom"" in eastern Germany. 
Fitzek has repeatedly clashed with the authorities and refused to abide by German laws, often in what appears to be in a publicity-seeking manner.
German police carried out a series of raids on Tuesday, arresting the leaders of the extreme-right Kingdom of Germany
He has previously been jailed for repeatedly driving without a licence, following a decision to hand his back in a symbolic rejection of the law. At the end of one trial session, Fitzek was seen getting into his car in front of the court and driving off.
Fitzek is one of around 25,000 ReichsbÃ¼rger in Germany, external. Numbers have been growing over the last few years.
Many are right-wing extremists who peddle racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories. They refuse to recognise the authority of security forces and many possess illegal arms, which has led to shoot-outs with police. Officials say that around 2,500 are potentially violent and that 1,350 are classed as right-wing extremists.
In 2022 dozens of people were arrested, many of them ReichsbÃ¼rger, for plotting to overthrow the German government in Berlin. They were accused of planning a violent coup, which included kidnapping the health minister, to create ""civil war conditions"" to bring down German democracy.
In the past, ReichsbÃ¼rger were often dismissed as eccentric cranks because of their outlandish ideas.
But as the far right has grown in strength politically in Germany over the last decade, officials now see them as a serious threat.
The federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said Fitzek was arrested along with three other suspected ringleaders of the group, which it classified as a criminal organisation.
As the ""so-called supreme sovereign"", Fitzek had ""control and decision-making power in all key areas"", the office said.
""The 'Kingdom of Germany' considers itself a sovereign state within the meaning of international law and strives to extend its claimed 'national territory' to the borders of the German Empire of 1871,"" it added in a statement."

A 16-year-old mountain biker is getting ready to hit the world stage when he represents Great Britain at the World Cup's downhill race in Poland.
Max Lewis, from Long Ashton, Bristol, is flying out to Bielsko-Biala in southern Poland this week in preparation for the competition.
The teenager was just 12 years old when he tried mountain biking for the first time on the winding trails at Ashton Court.
Max said: ""It's my first World Cup. I would love to win a World Cup and make a career out of it but I'm just going to have fun.""
The season opener of the UCI Mountain Bike Downhill World Cup takes place in the Beskid Mountains between 16 and 18 May.
Max said he was feeling a ""bit nervous"" but was ""looking forward to it"".
""World Cup tracks are not like your local trails, they're pretty full-on and gnarly - very scary - with big drops and big gap jumps,"" he said.
""It's just the quickest riders in the world who come to race in the World Cup.""
The teenager said he first ""fell in love"" with the gravity-fuelled sport when he got his first mountain bike.
Now, despite competing for only four years he has been picked to represent Great Britain.
""Last season, I had a decent season - just being consistent, building up and putting in some fast race runs - and here I am.""
Hitting speeds of up to 50mph (80kmph) in some of the men's races, while negotiating tree roots, banks, bumps and jumps, Max said he has had ""quite a few"" injuries.
""That's part of the risk of the sport. It's so much fun but it comes with big risks,"" he said.
""I've broken both my arms at once - went straight into the back of a jump.""

""I do a lot of training around Leigh Woods, Belmont Hill,"" he said.

Zambia's foreign minister has warned diplomats against interfering in the country's affairs, days after the US ambassador raised concerns about the ""systematic theft"" of drugs donated to the southern African state. 
Mulambo Haimbe said there was an ""increasing tendency"" by envoys to ignore diplomatic channels, and this could undermine the ""spirit of mutual respect"".
He did not name anyone, but his comments were seen as being directed at the US ambassador to Lusaka, Michael Gonzales. 
Last week, Gonzales called a press conference to announce that the US was cutting $50m (Â£37m) of health aid to Zambia because of the theft of life-saving medications that the US had provided for patients. 
He added that he had decided to go public after holding more than 30 fruitless meetings with senior Zambian officials. 
In his response, Haimbe said that addressing the government through the media amounted to interference and was in breach of diplomatic conventions.
""We remain open to addressing any matters of concern through appropriate diplomatic channels,"" the minister added. 
Last week, the US embassy said it had presented its findings of the alleged corruption to Zambian officials in April last year, and had offered help to stop further theft and to bring the culprits to justice. 
However, no action was taken by the Zambian authorities, it added.
On Monday, Zambia's Home Affairs Minister Jacob Mwiimbu said that a forensic audit on the alleged theft had been completed and handed over to security agencies for further action. 
About 75 people have been arrested in a countrywide crackdown that saw more than 400 health facilities raided over the alleged scam, he said.  
""There will be no sacred cows in this pursuit,"" Mwiimbu added. 
Gonzales said that an inspection carried out by US officials at more than 2,000 pharmacies last year had found that most were selling drugs and medical supplies donated by the US.
Zambia's Health Minister Elijah Muchima earlier said the problem of theft predated the current government, which took office in 2021.
Muchima also said several Zambian officials had been sacked following the thefts identified by the US, and that ""an advanced digital stock tracking system"" had been set up to monitor the supply of medicines.
The cut in US assistance, expected to take effect next year, would affect drugs to treat malaria, HIV and TB.
But the health minister has reassured Zambians that there were sufficient stocks of all drugs so there was ""no immediate risk of shortages"".
Gonzales said the recent US measure was separate to the foreign aid freeze announced by President Donald Trump in January.
The freeze has affected health programmes across Africa, including shipments of critical medical supplies, among them HIV drugs.
In March, Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema said Trump had ""slapped us on both cheeks"", saying it was time for his country to strengthen its treasury to procure its own medicines.
The US accounts for about a third of public health spending in Zambia, according to  the US embassy.

A vandal has daubed an image of a penis on a wall at a centuries-old Peruvian city recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage Site.
The man was filmed while spraying the graffiti on one of the original walls of Chan Chan, a pre-Columbian city 500km (300 miles) north of Lima that is visited by thousands of people a month.
Peru's ministry of culture said the culprit showed ""a grave disrespect toward our history and cultural heritage, as well as a violation of the regulations that protect archaeological heritage sites"".
Some Peruvians questioned how he was able to damage the wall unchallenged,  while others said they were disappointed that the site was not better protected.
The video of the incident was widely shared on social media. The culprit could face up to six years in prison if caught.
Chan Chan was the capital of the ChimÃº kingdom before it fell to the Incas in the 15th century and it remains one of Peru's most important archaeological sites.

French film star GÃ©rard Depardieu has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris and given a suspended jail term of 18 months.
The 76-year-old actor was accused by the two women of groping them during work on a film in 2021. Depardieu had denied the allegations against him and his lawyer said he would appeal.
A court in Paris found that one of the women, a set dresser named AmÃ©lie, had given consistent evidence while the actor's accounts had changed over time. 
She told reporters afterwards she was ""very moved"" and satisfied with the verdict, which for her was ""a victory, a major step forward"".
Depardieu was not in court to hear the verdict
Depardieu was also convicted of assaulting an assistant director called Sarah, which was not her real name.
The actor was not in court to hear the verdict but was instead working on a film set in the Azores.
Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer acting for the two women, said she hoped the verdict marked the end of impunity for an artist in the film industry.
""It's a victory for two women on a film set but it's a victory for all the women behind this case and I'm thinking of all of Depardieu's other victims,"" she told reporters.
The lawyer also noted the case had come to an end hours before the Cannes film festival was due to start.
The judge said there was no reason to doubt the word of the two women victims, who had told the court how Depardieu had touched them on intimate parts of the body, using lewd language.
He placed Depardieu on a list of sex offenders and ordered him to pay compensation of â¬1,000 (Â£840) each to AmÃ©lie and Sarah for ""secondary victimisation"", a recent innovation covering the additional suffering for the women from the trial itself.
Depardieu's lawyer JÃ©rÃ©mie Assous had accused the women of lying during their evidence.
The assaults took place in September 2021 when Depardieu was making a film called Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) about an ageing actor coming to terms with his declining powers.
This was Depardieu's first trial on sexual assault charges. Several other women have made similar allegations in the media, and an alleged rape case could come to trial in the future.
After the trial, the actor was invited to join his close friend and fellow actor Fanny Ardant for a film-shoot in the Azores. 
At the end of the trial in Paris in late March, prosecutor Laurent Guy said: ""It's perfectly possible to be an excellent actor and a great father - and still commit a crime.
""You are not here to pass judgment on French cinema. You are here to judge GÃ©rard Depardieu, just as you would any other citizen.""
Claude Vincent, representing one of the two women plaintiffs, described Depardieu as a ""misogynist"" and a ""case-study in sexism"".
Depardieu's lawyer had demanded an acquittal and called the plaintiffs' team ""more militants than lawyers"".
""They cannot bear that there should even be a defence. They think any defence is a supplementary assault,"" he told the court.
The first plaintiff - 54-year-old set decorator AmÃ©lie - told the court that after a minor argument with Depardieu, he caught her between his legs and held her by the hips.
The second woman - a 34-year-old assistant film director - said the actor had touched her buttocks and breasts through her clothes on three separate occasions. She chose to maintain her anonymity and was not in court to hear the verdict.
Depardieu denied the allegations, saying only that he might have touched the women accidentally or to keep his balance.
At the end of the hearings, Depardieu said: ""My name has been dragged through the mud by lies and insults.
""A trial can be a very special experience for an actor. Seeing all this anger, the police, the press. It's like being in a science fiction film, except it's not science fiction. It's life.""

He thanked the prosecution and defence teams for giving him insights into how courts operate. ""These lessons may be an inspiration for me one day if I get to play a lawyer,"" he said.
Depardieu said he had not worked as an actor for three years since the sexual allegations against him began to circulate.
However earlier this month it was reported that he had begun working on a film directed by Fanny Ardant. Depardieu is playing a magician on a mysterious island, according to media reports.
Ardant appeared with Depardieu in Les Volets Verts and spoke in his defence at the trial.
""Genius - in whatever form it takes - carries within it an element of the extravagant, the untamed, the dangerous. (Depardieu) is the monster and the saint,"" she said.
Another veteran French actress took Depardieu's side on Monday. In a rare interview with French television, Brigitte Bardot, 90, deplored how ""talented people who touch the buttocks of a girl are consigned to the deepest dungeon.""
""Feminism isn't my thing,"" Bardot said. ""Personally, I like men."""

Days after India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, questions remain over what lies ahead for the two South Asian neighbours.
Early on 7 May, India launched air strikes into Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir (Islamabad has denied involvement in the attack).
What followed were four days of intense shelling and aerial incursions between the two nuclear-armed countries, until the surprise ceasefire, external announcement on Saturday.
But - even accounting for the usually tense relationship between India and Pakistan - things are nowhere close to normal yet.
The fragile ceasefire, now in its fourth day, is still holding as life slowly begins to return to normal in towns along the de facto border between India and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, days before launching the military operation, India had announced a flurry of diplomatic measures against Pakistan, including suspending a key water-sharing treaty, halting most visas and stopping all trade.
In response, Islamabad announced its own set of tit-for-tat actions, including the suspension of visas for Indians, a trade ban and the closure of its airspace to Indian flights.
None of these punitive measures have been reversed by both countries so far. Here's where things currently stand between the two neighbours in terms of the measures announced since the Pahalgam attack:
India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack
On Monday, in his first public comments on the strike, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, ""India's stand is absolutely clear - terror and talks cannot go hand in hand."" 
""Water and blood cannot flow together,"" he added.
His comments align with media reports citing sources that say that the key water-sharing treaty between India and Pakistan, known as the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), remains suspended.
The 1960 treaty, brokered by the World Bank, governs water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries. 
The IWT has survived two wars between the countries and was held up as an example of trans-boundary water management, until the suspension late last month.  
READ: Can India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?
Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier said that he believed the water issue with India would be resolved through peaceful negotiations.
India's decision to suspend the treaty marks a significant diplomatic shift. Pakistan depends heavily on these rivers for agriculture and civilian water supply.
""Water cannot be weaponised,"" Pakistan's Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told Reuters news agency on Monday, adding that ""unilateral withdrawal has no legal basis"". 
But experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes. However, if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season.
Soon after India suspended the IWT, Pakistan threatened to suspend a 1972 peace treaty called the Simla Agreement, which established the Line of Control, or de facto border between the countries. It hasn't suspended this so far.  
India scaled down its diplomatic relations with Pakistan as part of its retaliatory measures. 
It expelled all Pakistani defence attachÃ©s, external, declaring them ""persona non grata"" (unwelcome) and announced it would withdraw its own defence advisers from its high commission in Islamabad.
Pakistan responded with similar steps. Both countries reduced the staff at their respective high commissions.
Both India and Pakistan also suspended almost all visas given to people from the other country.
As part of their retaliatory measures, both India and Pakistan shut down the Attari-Wagah border, the only land crossing between the two countries.
The border, which is heavily guarded and requires special permits to cross, has long been used by people visiting family members, attending weddings or reconnecting with loved ones across the border.
Both countries initially gave their citizens nearly a week to return, but the deadline was later extended.
For days, emotional scenes unfolded at the border, as families were separated, with some people staying behind.
'What is our fault?': Families separated at India-Pakistan border
After the 7 May strikes, India also announced that it would be closing entry from its side to the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor, which allows Indian pilgrims to visit one of Sikhism's holiest shrines in Pakistan without a visa.
Almost 200,000 Indians visited the Kartarpur shrine between 2021 and 2023, external, Indian officials said last year. The latest figures have not yet been released.
Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters last week that the suspension would remain in place until further notice.

As part of its retaliatory measures, Pakistan also announced the closure of its airspace to all Indian flights.
In the following days, India responded with similar restrictions, closing its airspace to all Pakistani flights, both military and commercial.
International flights are now being forced to take longer, costlier detours, increasing both travel time and fuel expenses.
The two countries have also suspended all direct and indirect trade. 
Experts say the impact on India would be minimal because it does not import much from Pakistan. However, it creates bigger problems for Pakistan.
Already struggling with high inflation and a weak economy, Pakistan could face more pressure as it loses access to trade routes and crucial goods from India, such as raw materials and medicines.

More than 200 marine species off the coast of South Australia (SA) have been killed by a weeks-long toxic algae explosion, in what conservationists have described as ""a horror movie for fish"".
The algal bloom - a rapid increase in the population of algae in water systems - has been spreading since March, growing to about 4,500 sq km (3,400 sq miles), or roughly the size of nearby Kangaroo Island.
""It's an unprecedented event, because the bloom has continued to build and build,"" said Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist.
Other scientists say the algae produces poisons which ""act like a toxic blanket that suffocates"" a wide range of marine life, including fish, rays and sharks.
Brad Martin, SA project manager for OzFish, a non-profit organisation that protects fishing habitats, said that while algal blooms are not uncommon, the ""massive"" scale of the current event has had a dramatic impact on marine life.
Toxins produced by the algae can cause ""gill and tissue damage"" by attacking the red blood cells, Mr Martin told the BBC.
The large density of the bloom also means that oxygen is being taken out of the water, ""so we know that the fish are suffocating"".
""It is like a horror movie for fish,"" he said.
The event has been widely documented by people sending in pictures of dead wildlife washed up on beaches.
The effect on sharks and rays has been particularly graphic, with large numbers washing up on beaches ""bright red"", showing indications of haemorrhaging.
A three-metre great white shark was among those found dead in recent weeks. 
Among the more than 200 species that have been killed, which range from the smallest of baby fish to great whites, some are more vulnerable than others. 
Reef species like crabs and pufferfishes have been the worst hit, as they are less mobile and can't swim away from the toxic algae.
While the algae isn't harmful to humans, those exposed to high doses can experience skin irritation and respiratory symptoms such as coughing or breathing issues.
The SA government has advised people to avoid swimming at beaches where there is discoloured water and foam.
Algal blooms occur during sunny and warm conditions, and SA has had a marine heatwave since last September, with temperatures about 2.5 degrees warmer than average.
Australia has also been experiencing unseasonably warm conditions since March, which has further driven the size and duration of the current algal bloom.
The last time SA recorded a large event of this type of toxic algae was in 2014, according to the state's environment and water department.
The spread has also affected some commercial fisheries, which have pre-emptively closed harvest areas.
Local coastal businesses have also seen a dip in visitors due to the sheer number of dead marine life washing up on shore. 
Meanwhile, researchers and the SA government are continuing to monitor the bloom as it moves west."

An Israeli air strike on the emergency department of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza has killed a well-known Palestinian photojournalist, medical sources and eyewitnesses say.
Hassan Aslih, who was being treated for injuries from a previous Israeli strike, was targeted in what witnesses described as a drone attack on the hospital's surgical wing.
A doctor there confirmed that Aslih had been at the hospital for nearly a month after surviving an air strike on the same facility in April.
The Israeli military had previously accused Aslih of involvement in the 7 October Hamas attack, external on Israel. The strike in April killed Aslih's colleague Helmi al-Faqawi and wounded several other journalists. 
At the time, Ismail al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run government media office, said Israel's accusations against Aslih were ""false"" and that Aslih had no political affiliation.
""The occupation's claim that Aslih crossed into the occupied land and took part in the 7 October incidents is part of a policy to discredit and fabricate that the occupation adopts to justify attacks on journalists and media personnel,"" Thawabta told Reuters agency on 7 April.
Aslih had published dozens of photos and videos documenting the 7 October Hamas assault from inside Israeli territory.
Aslih worked for years as a freelance photojournalist with both international and local news agencies. He was widely respected in Gaza for his extensive coverage of the conflict, often documenting events from the front lines. He has more than half a million followers on Instagram, where he documents the war. 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had attacked Nasser Hospital in a ""a targeted attack on key terrorists"", but did not name Aslih. 
It said the hospital was being used by Hamas to ""carry out terrorist plots against Israeli forces and citizens"".
The Israeli military has repeatedly attacked what it claims are Hamas command-and-control centres based in hospitals or gunmen sheltering there. Hamas denies using hospitals in this way.
The UN's human rights office has condemned what it calls Israel's ""pattern of deadly attacks, external on and near hospitals in Gaza"", saying they could amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.
The Israel-Gaza war is the deadliest conflict for journalists in history, according to Brown University's Watson Institute for Public Affairs, with more than 232 journalists killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks. 
The aid agency MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res said on X that the strike on Nasser hospital killed one other person and injured a further 12, and called for a halt to the targeting of medical facilities. 
The attack was ""horrific"", said emergency coordinator Clare Manera, adding that it came at a time when healthcare workers in the strip were ""struggling to treat patients with little to no supplies""."

As the noise and colour of a two-month election campaign subsides, a game of thrones between the two most powerful families in the Philippines resumes.
President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr, and his Vice-President, Sara Duterte, are embroiled in a bitter feud, and a battle for power. 
As allies they won a landslide victory in the last presidential election in 2022. 
But as their relationship has fractured - he accusing her of threatening to assassinate him, she accusing him of incompetence and saying she dreamed of decapitating him - this mid-term election has become a critical barometer of the strength of these two political dynasties.
And the results were not great news for the Marcos camp. Typically incumbent presidents in the Philippines get most of their picks for the senate elected in the mid-term election. The power of presidential patronage is a significant advantage, at least it has been in the past. 
But not this time.
Only six of the 12 winning senators are from the Marcos alliance, and of those one, Camille Villar, is only half in his camp, as she also accepted endorsement from Sara Duterte. 
Four of the senators are in the Duterte camp, including the president's sister Imee Marcos. Two were in the top three vote-winners, ahead of any Marcos candidate. 
For a sitting president, this is a poor result. 
Senators are elected on a simple, nationwide vote, which is a good indication of national opinion. The result could weaken the authority of the Marcos administration in the last three years of his term, and it casts doubt on the plan to incapacitate Sara Duterte by impeaching her.
The Marcos-Duterte relationship has been deteriorating almost since the start of their administration three years ago. But it was only this year that it ruptured completely. 
The decision by the president's allies in Congress to start impeaching the vice-president was the first irreparable breach. 
Then in March President Marcos sent Sara's father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity over his brutal war on drugs. The police have also now filed criminal charges against her.
The gloves were off. Impeachment would result in Sara Duterte being barred from public office, ending her ambition to replace President Marcos at the next election. 
Right now she is the frontrunner, and few doubt that, if successful, she would use the power of the presidency to seek vengeance against the Marcos's.
But impeachment requires two thirds of the 24-seat senate to vote for it, which is why this mid-term election mattered so much to both camps.
Power, survival and revenge: Whatâs at stake in the Philippines election?
Politics in the Philippines is a family business. Once a family achieves political power, it holds onto it, and passes it around the various generations. 
While there are around 200 influential families, the Dutertes and Marcoses sit at the top of the pyramid. 
The Marcoses have been in politics for 80 years. The current president's father ruled from 1965 to 1986, imposing martial law, and plundering billions of dollars from the national purse. 
Bongbong Marcos' mother, Imelda, who at the age of 95 cast her vote in this election from a wheelchair, is an even more notorious figure, and not just for her shoe collection.
His sister Imee has been re-elected to the senate, thanks to her decision to defect to the Duterte camp. 
His eldest son Sandro is a congressman, and his cousin Martin Romualdez is speaker of the lower house and a likely presidential candidate in 2028 - probably the reason why Romualdez was so keen to drive through the impeachment of Sara Duterte. 
In the president's home province of Ilocos Norte, his wife's cousin has been elected governor, his nephew elected vice-governor, and two other cousins elected as city councillors. Up there, Marcoses always win.
Much the same is true of the Dutertes in their stronghold in Davao at the other end of the country. 
Even from his prison cell in The Hague, former President Duterte ran for mayor of Davao, and won easily, even though all voters got to see of him was a life-size cardboard cutout. 
His absence will not matter though, because the previous mayor was his son Sebastian, who now takes over the vice-mayor's job. Dutertes have been mayors of Davao for 34 out of the last 37 years.
The problem confronting both camps is that the senators also typically come from big political families, or are celebrities in their own right â many candidates come from a media or showbiz background. 
They have interests and ambitions of their own. Even if officially allied with one camp or the other, there is no guarantee they will stay loyal, especially on the issue of impeachment.
""Senators in the Philippines are very sensitive to national public opinion, because they imagine themselves as vice presidents or presidents in-waiting,"" says Cleve Arguelles, a political scientist who runs WR Numero Research, which monitors public opinion.
""So, they are always trying to read the public mind, and side with public opinion because of their future political ambitions.""
Bongbong Marcos comes from one of the Philippines' top political families
In recent months public sentiment has not been on the president's side. 
Bongbong Marcos has never been a good public speaker, and his stage appearances in the campaign did little to lift his flagging popularity. 
His management of the economy, which is struggling, gets low marks in opinion polls, and his decision to detain former President Duterte and send him to the International Criminal Court is being portrayed by the Duterte family as a national betrayal.
At an impromptu rally in Tondo, a low-income neighbourhood in Manila's port area, Sara Duterte played an emotionally-charged video of the moment her father was taken into custody at Manila's international airport and put on a private jet to The Hague. She portrayed this as unforgivable treatment of a still popular former president. 
""They didn't just kidnap my dad, they stole him from us,"" she told the cheering crowd. 
Also on stage was President Marcos's elder sister Imee, who disagreed with the extradition and jumped ship to the Duterte camp â though most observers view this as a cynical move to capitalise on Duterte popular support, so she could lift her own flagging campaign to retain her senate seat. 
It worked. From polling low through much of the campaign, Imee Marcos managed to scrape into the ""magic twelve"", as they call the winning senators.
What happens now is difficult to predict, but the Marcos camp certainly faces an uphill battle to get Sara Duterte impeached. 
Of the 24 senators, only a handful are automatically loyal to the president. The rest will have to be persuaded to go along with it, , and that won't be easy. 
This election has shown that the Dutertes still have very strong public support in some areas, and some in the Marcos election alliance are already on record as saying they oppose impeaching the vice-president. The same goes for the 12 senators who were not up for election this year.
One bright spot for the president could be the surprise election of senators Bam Aquino and Francis Pangilinan, both from the liberal wing of politics. 
Few polls had predicted their wins, which suggest a public desire for politicians outside the Marcos-Duterte feud. 
Neither is a friend of the Marcos clan â liberals were the main opposition to the Marcos-Duterte team in the 2022 election. 
But they were strongly opposed to the strongman style of former President Duterte, and may fear his pugnacious daughter becoming president in 2028. That may be enough to get them to vote for impeachment.
The impeachment trial is expected to start in July. The Dutertes can be expected to continue chipping away at the president's battered authority in public, and both camps will be lobbying furiously behind the scenes to get senators onto their side.
No president or vice-president has ever been successfully impeached in the Philippines. Nor have any president and vice president ever fallen out so badly. 
It is going to be a turbulent year.
More than 68 million Filipinos were registered to vote in Monday's elections"

The last major music event she attended was the Nova festival, in Israel, where she was nearly killed. On 7 October 2023, the singer fled the festival when Hamas gunmen started shooting. 
Now she's preparing to go on stage at the world's largest music event.
""It's something I deal with every day,"" she told the BBC. ""It feels like a personal win, just to be having this experience and representing my country and doing it with such pride.""
On that day - one and a half years ago - Ms Raphael was attending her first outdoor rave. As rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, and Hamas gunmen started shooting at revellers, she attempted to flee the carnage.
She and her friends took refuge in a concrete bomb shelter at the side of a road. Around 50 people were crammed in, lying on top of each other.
But there was no escape as the gunmen shot repeatedly into the mass of bodies in the shelter and then threw in hand grenades.
Ms Raphael managed to call her father in tears, as heard in a recording played in an Israeli documentary. ""Dad, lots of people are dead. Send the police here. Please dad, send the police, it's urgent.. they're crushing me,"" she said.
""Be quiet,"" he replied. ""Yuvali my daughter. Yuvali, breathe deep. Hide. Play dead.""
""Bye,"" she said, thinking that was the end.
Ms Raphael was one of only 11 people in the shelter to survive. She hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until they were rescued.
That day, around 1,200 people were killed by gunmen led by Hamas, and 251 were taken hostage.

Ms Raphael's professional singing career started after the attack. ""I wished for myself to be happy and to really understand the gift that I had been given, and that's to live,"" she says. ""To have more experiences, to be happy and to live fully.""
On Thursday, the 24-year-old will sing her song, New Day Will Rise, at the Eurovision semi-final with shrapnel still in her leg.
The rules of the European Broadcasting Union â which is in charge of Eurovision â means no political statements can be made. The singer won't describe what happened to her at Nova during the run-up to the competition. She previously gave testimony about her experience to the United Nations.
The Israeli entrant has had to contend with protests about her country's participation in the song contest.
Irish national broadcaster RTÃ asked the EBU for a discussion on Israel's inclusion. Its director general, Kevin Bakhurst, said he was ""appalled by the ongoing events in the Middle East and by the horrific impact on civilians in Gaza, and the fate of Israeli hostages"". Spain and Slovenia's broadcasters also asked for a discussion.
Last week, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the competition.
More than 52,800 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, including 2,700 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry.
In previous years, other countries have been banned from the contest. Belarus was suspended in 2021 after submitting an overtly political entry and a year later Russia was barred over the war in Ukraine.
Ms Raphael told the BBC she anticipated booing but ""we are here to sing""
Ms Raphael said she was trying not to deal with those who say her country shouldn't be competing. ""Everybody has opinions,"" she said. ""I'm really putting everything aside and just concentrating on the most important thing. The slogan this year is 'united by music' and that's what we are here for.""
Eurovision said it understood the concerns and views about the current situation in the Middle East, but insisted members should ensure Eurovision remained a ""universal event that promotes connections, diversity and inclusion through music"".
Nevertheless, Israeli fans have been warned by their country's National Security Council not to wear Jewish or Israeli symbols while attending Eurovision.
On Sunday, during the Eurovision opening parade in the Swiss host city of Basel, the Israeli broadcasting delegation made a complaint to the police and the EBU after accusing a pro-Palestinian demonstrator of making a throat-slitting gesture and spitting at the delegation.
""It was scary at times, even uncomfortable, but it makes me keep reminding myself why I'm here and my agenda, which is spreading as much love as I can and bringing pride to my country,"" Ms Raphael said.
Last year, the Israeli singer Eden Golan, who said she received death threats, was booed as she sang. ""I think I'm expecting it,"" admitted Ms Raphael, when she was asked if she too anticipated booing. ""But we are here to sing and I'm going to sing my heart out for everyone.""
She said they had done a few rehearsals with sounds in the background so she could practise with distractions. Asked if that was upsetting, she told the BBC she had a lot of emotions she was putting aside to stay focused.
""I really think I have a lot of weight on my shoulders, I have a very big responsibility. I have a lot of people at home that are expecting something."""

Australia's Liberal Party has for the first time chosen a woman as its leader, with Sussan Ley to take over from Peter Dutton after he led the party to a bruising election loss.
Ley, from the moderate faction of the party, beat Angus Taylor - who ran on a promise to restore conservative values - by four votes.
At the election on 3 May, the Liberal-National coalition, currently Australia's main opposition party, suffered what many are calling the worst defeat in its history.
Pundits and MPs have blamed the result on polarising leaders, a messy campaign and ""Trumpian"" policies, which alienated women and young people in particular.
Ley's appointment comes as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was sworn in at Government House on Tuesday, following his Labor Party's landslide election win. 
According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Labor has won at least 93 seats - increasing their majority by 16 - while the Coalition has 42 electorates, down from 58. Some seats are still too close to call.
Ley has held the massive regional New South Wales seat of Farrer since 2001 and has served as a senior minister in a variety of portfolios - making her one of the Liberal Party's most experienced hands. She was also the party deputy under Dutton.
Ted O'Brien, a Queensland MP who was the energy spokesman in charge of selling the coalition's controversial nuclear power proposal, was elected Ley's deputy.
Ley said she wanted to help the party rebuild its relationship with Australians - particularly the women and young people who felt they'd been neglected.
""We have to have a Liberal Party that respects modern Australia, that reflects modern Australia, and that represents modern Australia. And we have to meet the people where they are,"" she said.
She told reporters the party's loss would be subject to a review - as would all of its policies, including its position on nuclear and its net zero emissions goal.
""I want to do things differently, and we have to have a fresh approach,"" she said.
""I committed to my colleagues that there would be no captain's calls from anywhere by me... that we would work through every single policy issue and canvas the different views and take the time to get it right.""
In a statement after the leadership vote, unsuccessful contender Taylor congratulated Ley and called for unity.
""Sussan has led a remarkable life and becoming the first woman to lead the Liberal Party is a milestone for Sussan and our party,"" he said.
The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected leader David Littleproud on Monday, after he too was challenged by a hardline conservative colleague. 
Albanese's new cabinet was also sworn in on Tuesday.
The biggest changes include former Labor deputy Tanya Plibersek swapping from the environment portfolio to social services, and former communications minister Michelle Rowland becoming attorney general.
Former Attorney General Mark Dreyfus and Ed Husic - the first Muslim to become an Australian government minister - were both removed from the frontbench. 
""I have got people who are, I think, in the best positions and that's across the board,"" Albanese said when announcing the positions on Monday.
Born in Nigeria to English parents, Ley grew up in the United Arab Emirates before moving to Australia at age 13.
""Travelling, and being at boarding school on my own, I think you either sink or swim,"" Ley said in a previous interview. ""Obviously, I was someone who decided very early on in life that I wasn't going to sink.""
It was as a young woman that she changed her name from Susan to Sussan, inspired by numerology - an ancient belief that numbers have a mystical impact on people's lives.
""I read about this numerology theory that if you add the numbers that match the letters in your name you can change your personality,"" she told The Australian.
""I worked out that if you added an 's' I would have an incredibly exciting, interesting life and nothing would ever be boring. It's that simple.""
""And once I'd added the 's' it was really hard to take it away.""
As an adult she has had a ""wonderfully varied"" career path, Ley says, obtaining degrees in economics and accounting while raising three young children, earning a commercial pilot licence, and working in the outback mustering livestock.
Elected in 2001 to represent an area the size of New Zealand, Ley was promoted to Health Minister under Malcom Turnbull in 2014, but resigned two years later amid an expenses scandal.
Ley apologised after using a taxpayer-funded trip to purchase an apartment on Queensland's Gold Coast.
She re-joined the frontbench in 2019 after Scott Morrison's ""miracle"" election win, as the Minister for Environment. 
In that role, she was taken to court by a group who claimed she had a duty of care towards children to protect them from harm caused by climate change. Eight teenagers and an 87-year-old nun convinced a court that the government had a legal duty towards them when assessing fossil fuel projects, but the landmark decision was later overturned.
Ley has also drawn headlines for her comments about Palestinians. She was a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, an informal cross-party group which aimed to raise the experiences of Palestinian people and has spoken in the chamber in support of Palestinian autonomy.
However, speaking after the vote on Tuesday, one of her colleagues Andrew Wallace said she has ""seen the light on Israel in recent years""."

Dominated by a fiery feud between two political dynasties, the Philippine mid-term elections have thrown up unexpected results that may shake President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr's hold on the senate.
According to the latest count of 80% of the votes, Marcos allies appear to have captured fewer senate seats than expected.
Meanwhile his rival, former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who is detained in The Hague over his drug war that killed thousands, has been elected mayor of his family's stronghold.
The fate of his daughter Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing an impeachment trial, remains in the balance.
The mid-terms held on Monday saw 18,000 seats contested, from local officials to governors and senators. It served as a proxy war between Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte, who were one-time allies. 
The senate race, where 12 seats were up for grabs, was closely watched as it affects Sara Duterte's trial, which she has called ""political persecution"". 
The popular vice-president, who is widely expected to run for president in 2028, is facing the prospect of a ban from politics, should a jury made up of senators vote to impeach her.
Many people had expected Marcos Jr's picks to win most of the 12 seats. But according to the latest count of 80% of the votes, only six from his camp appear to have won seats, and one of them has also been endorsed by the Dutertes.
In the top five ranking - a barometer of public popularity - only one Marcos-backed candidate, broadcaster Erwin Tulfo, made it. 
Meanwhile, at the very top of the list is a Duterte loyalist - long-time aide Christopher ""Bong"" Go - while at number three is another Duterte ally, former police chief Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa.
The Duterte camp appears to have won at least four seats. They include Marcos Jr's older sister Imee, who recently bolted from her brother's alliance to side with the Dutertes.
What complicates things is that it is still unclear how Marcos' allies in the senate will move on Sara Duterte's impeachment. Their loyalty can shift, as senators also balance their own interests and ambitions with their political allegiances.
Meanwhile, two people who are not affiliated with either camp appear to have also won senate seats.
They are Paolo Benigno ""Bam"" Aquino, and an Aquino ally, Francis Pangilinan.
Bam Aquino, the cousin of a former president, has in fact clinched second place in the rankings, in what he called a ""very, very surprising"" result. 
It marks the first time in years that voters had chosen outside the Marcos and Duterte dynasties.
The Aquino family was the Marcoses' main political nemesis in the 1980s and early 1990s before the rise of the Dutertes.
It was the assassination of opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino Jr in 1983 that galvanised protests against Ferdinand Marcos Sr - the current president's father - culminating in the Marcos family's ouster and exile in 1986.
Monday's result signals their comeback after being wiped out of national politics in recent years.
Ronald dela Rosa (L) and Christopher Go (R) campaign with Duterte's youngest daughter, Veronica (Centre).
Results so far also show the Dutertes have managed to retain their power base in the south of the country, just two months after the 80-year-old populist leader Rodrigo Duterte was arrested at Manila Airport and flown to the Netherlands on the same day to face the International Criminal Court.
It was his arrest - approved by Marcos Jr - which pushed the rivalry between his daughter and the current president to boiling point, a few weeks after the president's allies in the House of Representatives voted to impeach Vice-President Duterte.
Rodrigo Duterte was always expected to win as mayor, given the family has held the post since the mid-1980s.
Duterte himself led Davao, a sprawling southern metropolis, for two decades before he was elected president in 2016. There, he showcased his drug war that he credited for the city's success, and won him the support of millions far beyond its borders.
His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor, was elected vice-mayor, meaning he can discharge his father's duties in his absence. Another Duterte son, Paolo, was re-elected as congressman. His grandchildren won local posts.
Duterte's name remained on the ballot as he has not been convicted of any crime. He beat the scion of a smaller rival political family.
Maintaining a political base in Davao city in the south is crucial for the Dutertes - it is where they get the most voter support.

The election was not just a battle between the two families, however.
Monday's vote saw long queues under temperatures of 33C (91F) and sporadic reports of violence and vote machines malfunctioning.
Like past elections, song-and-dance, showbusiness-style campaigns played out on stage and on social media, underscoring the country's personality and celebrity politics that sometimes overshadow more pressing issues such as corruption, high cost of living and creaking infrastructure.

For decades, if there's one thing that's been a taboo in the Indian foreign ministry, it is third-party mediation - particularly in the long-running dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.
Those in the know, then, are not surprised that US President Donald Trump - known for his unorthodox diplomacy - has touched a raw nerve in Delhi. 
On Saturday, he took to social media to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"", brokered by the US. 
Later, in another post he said: ""I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at, concerning Kashmir."" 
The Kashmir dispute dates back to 1947, when India got independence from British rule and was partitioned to create Pakistan. Both neighbours claim the Kashmir region in whole, but administer it only in part.
Several rounds of bilateral talks over the decades have not yielded any resolution. India treats Kashmir as an integral part of its territory and rules out any negotiation, particularly through a third party.
The latest flare-up began after India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist infrastructure inside Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, killing 26 people, mainly tourists.
India blames Pakistan of involvement in the incident, a charge denied by Islamabad.
Trump's intervention came as fighting between the two nuclear-armed rivals was threatening to spiral into a full-blown conflict.
The two sides were using fighter jets, missiles and drones and said they were targeting each other's military installations, mainly in the border areas.
While US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels, prevented a bigger conflagration, President Trump's offer has put Delhi in a spot.
""Obviously, it would not be welcome by the Indian side. It goes against our stated position for many years,"" Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, tells the BBC.
Both India and Pakistan claim the scenic Kashmir region in full, but administer it only in part
Islamabad, on the other hand, has welcomed Trump's comments.
""We also appreciate President Trump's expressed willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute - a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond,"" a  foreign ministry statement said., external.
Delhi's position on Kashmir has hardened, especially after it withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, triggering widespread protests in Kashmir.
President Trump's recent comments have irked many Indians, who see this as an attempt to ""internationalise"" the Kashmir dispute.
The main opposition Congress party wanted an explanation from the government and an all-party meeting on the ""ceasefire announcements made from Washington DC first"".
""Have we opened the doors to third-party mediation? The Indian National Congress would like to ask if diplomatic channels between India and Pakistan are being reopened,"" said the Congress party spokesman Jairam Ramesh.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement, external announcing the ceasefire also said that the two countries have also agreed ""to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site"". This has caught the Indians by surprise.
Delhi has refused to hold discussions with Islamabad, accusing its neighbour of supporting what it calls cross-border terrorism.
Historically, India has opposed any third-party mediation, quoting an agreement signed in 1972 after a war between the two countries a year earlier. As per the Simla agreement signed by the country's leaders, they ""resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations"".
Indian officials also argue that even when they reach an understanding with a civilian government in Pakistan, the country's powerful military launched operations undermining those deals. They point to the Kargil war in 1999, when another conflict between the two countries began after a group of Pakistan-backed militants occupied strategic areas in Indian-administered Kashmir.
The conflict took place months after the then Indian and Pakistani prime ministers agreed to resolve issues through bilateral negotiations and refrain from interfering in each other's internal matters.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has not formally responded to President Trump's offer to mediate.
But Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said: ""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so.""
It is being seen as an indication that India may not be restarting direct bilateral talks soon.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was mentioned in Rubio's tweet saying the two sides would start ""talks on a broad range of issues"" 
The view from Pakistan is different. 
""Pakistan has always wanted third-party mediation in the Kashmir issue in the absence of mutual trust between the two countries,"" Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Centre for Research and Security Studies in Islamabad, tells the BBC.
""Now a superpower is willing to stick its neck out. Pakistan will see this as a moral victory,"" Mr Gul says.
Pakistani strategic experts like Syed Muhammad Ali argue it is because of India's consistent refusal to engage with Pakistan that the international community should step in to avoid any future conflict.
""Kashmir is one of the most critical issues for the international community. The recent rapid escalation proves that the sabre-rattling can go out of hand,"" Mr Ali says.
India's assertive diplomacy, particularly since Modi took over in 2014, has been seen as a sign of its confidence as a rising global economic power.
But it will have to pull off a tough balancing act, to stave off Trump's advances. 
The US has courted India in recent years as a bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. India is a key member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group (Quad), along with the US, Australia and Japan, that was formed to counter Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific.
In recent decades, Washington has also sold modern transport planes, helicopters and other military equipment to Delhi, which is keen to modernise its 1.4 million strong military, that relies heavily on Russian weaponry.
The previous American administrations were aware of India's sensitivities towards the Kashmir issue and largely stayed away from interfering with it. But with Trump, there's a question mark over whether that position still holds. 
The US is the largest trading partner of India with bilateral trade reaching about $130bn (Â£98bn) in 2024. Modi's government is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington to avoid tariffs.
Delhi will have to walk a fine line. It will be averse to taking up Trump's offer to mediate,  or see the US-brokered ceasefire, or ""understanding"" as it calls it, going beyond the current military tensions. But it's also keen to have a favourable trading relationship with the US. 
Any attempt to broaden the talks - on contentious bilateral issues like the now suspended river water-sharing treaty or the status of Kashmir - will invite strong criticism at the domestic level, a trap that Modi is well aware of."

Russia was responsible for the downing of the Malaysia Airlines flight, MH17, over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, the United Nations aviation agency has ruled.
All 298 people on board the passenger plane were killed when it was shot down by a Russian-made missile.   
The Kremlin has always denied any responsibility for the air disaster.
On Monday, the UN's Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) voted that the Russian Federation failed to uphold its obligations under international air law, which requires states to ""refrain from resorting to the use of weapons against civil aircraft in flight"".
Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was struck down over the Donbas region of Ukraine, during a conflict between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces. 
The majority of passengers and crew, 196 people, were from the Netherlands.  
There were also 38 people from Australia, 10 British citizens, as well as Belgian and Malaysian nationals on board.  
The case to the UN was brought in 2022 by the Australian and Dutch governments, who have both welcomed the ICAO's ruling, external. 
""We call upon Russia to finally face up to its responsibility for this horrific act of violence and make reparations for its egregious conduct"", said Australia's foreign minister Penny Wong in a statement. 
The Dutch foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, said it marked an ""important step towards establishing the truth and achieving justice and accountability"". 
It sends a clear messaged to the international community, he added: ""states cannot violate international law with impunity"" . 
In 2022, a Dutch court ruled that a Russian-controlled group had downed the plane and two Russians and a pro-Moscow Ukrainian national were convicted of murder in absentia.
The trio were all sentenced to life in prison however, as they were not extradited, they have not served time in jail."

""They're giving us a gift,"" Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday, adding that he would be ""a stupid person"" if he did not accept it.  
In an earlier statement, a Qatari spokesman said it would be ""inaccurate"" to refer to the plane as a gift. He said the transfer of an aircraft for ""temporary use"" was under discussion between the two countries.
The news comes as Trump is set to visit Qatar this week as part of the first major foreign trip of his second term. 
Speaking on Monday, Trump said that the US had helped the other country ""a lot over the years in terms of security and safety"" and that he had ""a lot of respect for the leadership"" of the country.
He went on to say it would be a ""very nice gesture"" if Qatar provided the US with a Boeing jet while his government continued to wait for two new ones to be provided directly by Boeing itself. 
The potential value of the plane and its handling has raised legal and ethical questions among critics on the political left and right.
The US Constitution has a provision known as the Emoluments Clause, which restricts what gifts US presidents can accept from foreign governments. It was designed to prevent leaders from becoming beholden to foreign governments. 
On social media, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff from California quoted a section of the US Constitution that said no elected official could accept ""any present... of any kind whatever"" from the leader of a foreign state without congressional approval. 
Congressman Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called on the Government Accountability Office to investigate, saying the plane could ""constitute the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government"".
But there was criticism, too, from some of Trump's staunchest supporters.
Daily Wire podcaster Ben Shapiro lambasted the plane deal on Monday as ""skeezy"".
""Is this good for President Trump?"" Shapiro said. ""Is it good for his agenda? Is it good for draining the swamp and getting things done? The answer is no, it isn't.""
Far-right influencer Laura Loomer also criticised the move. She posted to say she would ""take a bullet"" for the president, but that any decision to accept the jet would be ""such a stain"" on the administration.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Sunday that ""any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump's administration is committed to full transparency"".
The White House's current fleet includes two Boeing 747-200B planes customised for presidential use with special communications equipment and features like a state room, office and conference room. The planes have been in use since 1990 and 1991.
Qatar is said to be offering a version of a Boeing 747-8, a much newer model that ABC News reports has been upgraded into a ""flying palace"".
The plane, reported to be worth about $400m (Â£303m), would not be ready for use right away if provided to the US, as it would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials, sources told CBS, the BBC's US partner. 
Boeing has already been contracted to directly provide the White House with two 747-8s directly, but Trump complained earlier this year that the firm was behind schedule. 
His team negotiated to receive these during his first term in office, though Boeing has cautioned that they will not be available for two or three more years.
I'm not happy with Boeing, Trump says over Air Force One
Qatar - a country with which Trump has long had a positive relationship - has also previously given private jets as gifts to other countries, including Turkey.
This would not be the first Trump-related deal with Qatar. Last month, his company signed a deal to build a luxury golf resort there, marking its first foreign deal since the Republican returned to office in January. 
According to CBS, the plane that Trump could acquire would be donated at the end of his term to his presidential library, which is a collection of artefacts related to a US leader's time in office.
Air Force One planes usually carry over to other administrations. According to the National Archives, only the presidential library for Ronald Reagan has an Air Force One jet.
Trump, a businessman-turned-president, has been no stranger to conflict-of-interest accusations since taking office in 2017. During his first term, critics accused him of enriching himself in a number of ways, including through his hotel in Washington DC. A lawsuit followed, but was never concluded.
Commenting on the potential transfer of the plane, David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University, told the BBC: ""It certainly stinks, but formally it's a transfer to the [US] government, not the office holder.""
However, the jet could be viewed as an illegal personal gift to Trump if he is able to use it in his private life after leaving office, Prof Super added.
As for who could protest such a move - Congress could pass a resolution denouncing it, said Prof Super, albeit this would be unlikely given the Republican dominance on Capitol Hill, and it would not stop the actual transfer."

I grew up in Nepal's capital watching the Himalayas. Ever since I left, I've missed sweeping, panoramic views of some of the highest mountain peaks on Earth.
Each time I visit Kathmandu, I hope to catch a glimpse of the dramatic mountain range. But these days, there's usually no luck.
The main culprit is severe air pollution that hangs as haze above the region.
And it's happening even during the spring and autumn months, which once offered clear skies.
Just last April, the international flight I was in had to circle in the sky nearly 20 times before landing in Kathmandu, because of the hazy weather impacting visibility at the airport.
The hotel I checked in at was at a reasonable height from which mountains are visible on a clear day â but there was no such day during my two-week stay.
Even from the major vantage point of Nagarkot, just outside Kathmandu, all that could be seen was haze, as if the mountains did not exist.
""I no longer brand the place for views of 'sunrise, sunset and Himalayas' as I did in the past,"" said Yogendra Shakya, who has been operating a hotel at Nagarkot since 1996.
""Since you can't have those things mostly now because of the haze, I have rebranded it with history and culture as there are those tourism products as well here.""
During an earlier trip a year ago, I was hopeful I would be able to see the mighty Himalayan peaks on a trek in the mesmerising Annapurna region â but had hardly any luck there either.

The hazy view from the same vantage point during my most recent visit
Scientists say hazy conditions in the region are becoming increasingly intense and lasting longer, reducing visibility significantly.
Haze is formed by a combination of pollutants like dust and smoke particles from fires, reducing visibility to less than 5,000m (16,400ft). It remains stagnant in the sky during the dry season - which now lasts longer due to climate change.
June to September is the region's rainy season, when Monsoon clouds rather than haze keep the mountains covered and visibility low.
Traditionally, March to May and October to November were the best times for business because that was when skies remained clear and visibility was best.
But with rising temperatures and a lack of rain, and worsening air pollution, the spring months are now seeing thick haze with low visibility. Those conditions are beginning as early as December.
Lucky Chhetri, a pioneering female trekking guide in Nepal, said hazy conditions had led to a 40% decrease in business.
""In one case last year, we had to compensate a group of trekkers as our guides could not show them the Himalayas due to the hazy conditions,"" she added
An Australian tourist who has visited Nepal more than a dozen times since 1986 described not seeing the mountains as a ""major let-down"".
""It wasn't like this 10 years ago but now the haze seems to have taken over and it is extraordinarily disappointing for visitors like me,"" said John Carrol.
Krishna Acharya, the provincial chair of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal in the western Gandaki province, says the trekking industry is in deep trouble.
""Our member trekking operators are getting depressed because no sighting of the Himalayas means no business. Many of them are even considering changing professions,"" he told the BBC.
Trekking guide Lucky Chhetri says business is down because of the hazy conditions
On the Indian side, near the central Himalayas, hoteliers and tour operators say haze is now denser and returns quicker than before.
""We have long dry spells and then a heavy downpour, unlike in the past. So with infrequent rain the haze persists for much longer,"" said Malika Virdi, who heads a community-run tourism business in the state of Uttarakhand.
However, Ms Virdi says tourists are persistent - with many who didn't catch the mountain range returning to try their luck again.
The western Himalayas in Pakistan have been relatively less affected by the haze because the mountains are relatively far from cities.
But locals say that even the ranges that were once easily visible from places like Peshawar and Gilgit are often no longer seen.
""The sheet of haze remains hanging for a longer period and we don't see the mountains that we could in the past,"" said Asif Shuja, the former head of Pakistan's environmental protection agency.
South Asian cities regularly top lists of places with highest levels of air pollution in the world.
Public health across the region has been badly impacted by the toxic air, which frequently causes travel disruption and school closures.
Vehicular and industrial emissions, dust from infrastructure construction and dry gravel roads as well as the open burning of waste are major sources of air pollution year-round.
This is compounded by soot from massive forest fires - which are increasing due to a longer dry season - and the burning of crop residues after the harvest by farmers in northern India, Pakistan and Nepal.
Weather conditions keeping warmer air above cooler air trap these pollutants and limit vertical air movement - preventing pollution from dispersing.
""Hazes and dust storms are increasing in South Asia, and this trend is projected to continue due to climate change and other factors,"" Dr Someshwor Das from the South Asia Meteorological Association told the BBC.
In 2024, the number of hazy days recorded at the airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in western Nepal, was 168 - up from 23 in 2020 and 84 in 2021, according to Nepal's department of hydrology and meteorology.

Experts believe the Himalayas are probably the worst affected mountain range in the world given their location in a populous and polluted region.
This could mean the scintillating view of the Himalayas could now largely be limited to photographs, paintings and postcards.
""We are left to do business with guilt when we are unable to show our clients the mountains that they pay us for,"" said trekking leader Ms Chhetri.
""And there is nothing we can do about the haze.""

The Canadian hip-hop artist was attacked by another inmate on Monday morning in a housing unit at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, about 75 miles (120km) north of Los Angeles, prison officials told the BBC. 
The 32-year-old rapper suffered wounds across his body - causing both of his lungs to collapse, according to a post on his Instagram account. 
Lanez, whose legal name is Daystar Peterson, is serving a 10-year prison sentence for shooting fellow musician Megan Thee Stallion in 2020. 
The star's Instagram post said he was stabbed in the back, torso, head and face. He was temporarily placed on a breathing apparatus but is now able to breathe on his own, the Instagram post adds. 
""Despite being in pain, he is talking normally, in good spirits, and deeply thankful to God that he is pulling through,"" the post said.
The attack happened around 07:20 local time (15:20 GMT), said Pedro CalderÃ³n Michel of the state's corrections department. 
Prison staff began first aid before Lanez was taken to a local medical facility for further treatment, he said. 
An investigation is underway into the stabbing, Mr CalderÃ³n Michel told the BBC. He did not comment on the attacker's motive.
Lanez was sentenced in 2023 for three felony gun-related charges, including assault with a semi-automatic firearm. 
He shot Megan Thee Stallion, whose legal name is Megan Pete, as they were leaving a pool party at reality star Kylie Jenner's Hollywood mansion. 
The pair argued inside a vehicle about their previous sexual relationship and careers, Megan Thee Stallion testified during the trial. 
She said that she had demanded to be let out of the vehicle, at which point Lanez started shooting at the ground and shouted at her to ""dance"".
She required surgery to remove bullet fragments from her foot.
Lanez refused to apologise and maintained his innocence in the shooting. 
The case divided the hip-hop world with rappers - including 50 Cent and Iggy Azalea -  appearing to take sides in the conflict. Some of them wrote to the court to ask for leniency in Lanez's sentencing. 
Lanez had seven US top 10 albums in the seven years before his conviction. He has teased the release of a new album, external from prison titled Peterson."

President Donald Trump has said the refugee applications for the country's Afrikaner minority had been expedited as they were victims of ""racial discrimination"".
The South African government said the group were not suffering any such persecution that would merit refugee status.
The Trump administration has halted all other refugee admissions, including for applicants from warzones. Human Rights Watch described the move as a cruel racial twist, saying that thousands of people - many black and Afghan refugees - had been denied refuge in the US.
The group of white South Africans, who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday, received a warm welcome from US authorities.
Some held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls.
The processing of refugees in the US often takes months, even years, but this group has been fast tracked. UNHCR - the United Nations refugee agency - confirmed to the BBC it wasn't involved in the vetting, as is usually the case.
Asked directly on Monday why the Afrikaners' refugee applications had been processed faster than other groups, Trump said a ""genocide"" was taking place and that ""white farmers"" specifically were being targeted.
""Farmers are being killed, they happen to be white, but whether they're white or black makes no difference to me."" 
But South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he told Trump during a phone call the US assessment of the situation was ""not true"". 
""A refugee is someone who has to leave their country out of fear of political persecution, religious persecution, or economic persecution,"" Ramaphosa said. ""And they don't fit that bill.""
In response to a question from the BBC at Dulles airport, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said: ""It is not surprising, unfortunately, that a country from which refugees come does not concede that they are refugees.""
The US has criticised domestic South African policy, accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without any compensation.
In January President Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed ""equitable and in the public interest"". 
But the government says no land has yet been seized under the act.
There has been frustration in South Africa over the slow pace of land reform in the three decades since the end of the racist apartheid system. 
While black South Africans make up more than 90% of the population, they only hold 4% of all privately owned land, according to a 2017 report.
One of Trump's closest advisers, South African-born Elon Musk, has previously said there was a ""genocide of white people"" in South Africa and accused the government of passing ""racist ownership laws"".
The claims of a genocide of white people have been widely discredited.
Skin colour of South African farmers ""makes no difference"" to Trump
In a statement to the BBC, Gregory Meeks, ranking Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Trump administration's refugee resettlement was ""not just a racist dog whistle, it's a politically motivated rewrite of history"".
The Episcopal Church said it would no longer work with the federal government on refugee settlement because of the ""preferential treatment"" granted for the Afrikaners.
Commenting on this news on X, Vice-President JD Vance posted, ""Crazy"".
Melissa Keaney, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance project, told the BBC the White House's decision to fast-track the Afrikaners' arrival amounted to ""a lot of hypocrisy and unequal treatment"".
Her organisation is suing the Trump administration after it indefinitely suspended the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) in January. She said that policy had left over 120,000 conditionally approved refugees in limbo.
Racially charged row between Musk and South Africa over Starlink
What's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?
Afrikaner author Max du Preez told the BBC's Newsday radio programme that claims of persecution of white South Africans were a ""total absurdity"" and ""based on nothing"".
Figures from the South African police show that in 2024, 44 murders were recorded on farms and smaller plots of agricultural land, with eight of those killed being farmers.
South Africa does not report on crime statistics broken down by race but a majority of the country's farmers are white, while other people living on farms, such as workers, are mostly black. 
Bilateral relations between the US and South Africa have been strained since President Trump first tasked his administration with resettling Afrikaners, a group with mostly Dutch ancestry, in the US.
In March, South Africa's ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing President Trump of using ""white victimhood as a dog whistle"", leading to the US accusing Mr Rasool of ""race-baiting"".
The US has also criticised South Africa for taking an ""aggressive"" position against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), where Pretoria has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government of genocide against Palestinians - a claim the Israelis strongly reject. 
President Trump's openness to accepting Afrikaner refugees comes as the US has engaged in a wider crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers from other countries.

Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months.  
The 21-year-old had been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023.
On Monday, Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. 
Mr Alexander is thought to be the last US citizen held by Hamas who was still alive.
President Trump offered ""congratulations"" to his family on his release.
Television pictures show Edan Alexander smiling as he embraces his parents and siblings at an Israeli military base.
In a statement, his family thanked the US president but also urged the Israeli government and negotiators to continue working to free the 58 remaining hostages.
Mr Alexander is the first hostage to be freed by Hamas since Israel restarted its military offensive on 18 March, after a two-month ceasefire came to an end.
On Monday, he was seen with masked Hamas fighters as they handed him over to Red Cross workers in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. 
He was then transferred to Israeli authorities in Gaza before being reunited with his family in southern Israel. The Israeli military said it provided a ""safe corridor"" for Mr Alexander's release.
A video shared on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's X account showed Yael Alexander speaking to her son over the phone.
""You are strong. You are protected. You are home,"" she said in the video.
Supporters in Tel Aviv gathered to watch and celebrate Edan Alexander's release
Netanyahu called Mr Alexander's return a ""very moving moment"" - and thanked Trump for his support.
The release had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas and ""the political pressure exerted by President Trump"", Netanyahu said.
He added that Israel intended to continue with plans to intensify its military actions in Gaza and that there would be no ceasefire.
Mr Alexander's family members have urged further efforts to release the remaining hostages.
Hamas had earlier said Mr Alexander's release was intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid into the enclave.
Israel has blocked the entry of all food, medication and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza for 70 days, which aid agencies say amounts to a policy of starvation and could be a war crime, and renewed its aerial bombardment and other military operations there in mid-March.
Hamas has previously said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war. This has been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu.
Trump is due to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday, and Israel has vowed to expand its military offensive against Hamas if no deal is reached by the end of his visit.
Israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of Gaza indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the UN and its humanitarian partners, who say they will not co-operate because it appears to ""weaponise"" aid.
Israel is due to send representatives to Qatar on Tuesday to discuss a proposal on further hostage releases.
Qatar and Egypt said that Mr Alexander's release was an encouraging sign of potential new truce talks. 
Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, Mr Alexander had been serving in an elite infantry unit on the Gaza border when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October 2003 attack.
About 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken. Some 58 hostages remain, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.
Five of the captives held in Gaza are believed to have US citizenship. Mr Alexander is thought to be the last American still alive.
Israel's military campaign has killed 52,829 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including 2,720 Palestinians killed since March."

Outlawed Kurdish group the PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding.
The move followed a call in February by the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for it to disband. 
The PKK insurgency initially aimed to create an independent homeland for Kurds, who account for about 20% of Turkey's population. But it has since moved away from its separatist goals, focusing instead on more autonomy and greater Kurdish rights.
More than 40,000 people have been killed since the insurgency began. 
The PKK - which is banned as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US - said it has ""completed its historical mission"" and would ""end the method of armed struggle.""
From now on, the Kurdish issue ""can be resolved through democratic politics"", the group said in a statement published on the PKK-affiliated news agency ANF. 
In February, Ocalan, 76, called on his movement to lay down its arms and dissolve itself. The PKK leader has been in solitary confinement in prison on an island in the Sea of Marmara, south-west of Istanbul, since 1999. 
Ocalan wrote a letter from prison in February saying ""there is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realisation of a political system. Democratic consensus is the fundamental way.""
It is unclear what Ocalan and his supporters will get in return for disbanding but there is speculation that he may be paroled. 
Kurdish politicians will be hoping for a new political dialogue, and a pathway towards greater Kurdish rights.
Both sides had reasons to do a deal now. 
The PKK has been hit hard by the Turkish military in recent years, and regional changes have made it harder for them and their affiliates to operate in Iraq and Syria.
President Erdogan needs the support of pro Kurdish political parties if he is to be able to run again in Turkey's next presidential election, due in 2028.
The decision to disband was an important step towards a ""terror-free Turkey"", and the process would be monitored by state institutions, a spokesperson for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party said, according to Reuters news agency. 
UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres welcomed the decision, saying that if the decision by the PKK was implemented, it would mark an important step towards peace. 
Brussels urged ""all parties to seize the moment"", while Syria's top diplomat, Asaad al-Shaibani called it a ""pivotal moment"" for the ""stability of our region as a whole"", the AFP news agency reported. 
Winthrop Rodgers, from the international affairs think tank Chatham House, said it would take ""a major democratic transition by Turkey"" to accommodate demands from Kurdish political parties.
There has been ""some goodwill"" from some Turkish leaders in recent months, Mr Rodgers said, which allowed the PKK disbandment to play out. 
He added: ""But whether that extends to the major changes needed to ensure full Kurdish participation in politics and society is far less clear.
""In a lot of ways, the ball is in Turkey's court.""

Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US.
He touted the move as ""one of the most consequential"" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall ""almost immediately, by 30% to 80%"".
But experts are highly sceptical of the claims, and stock market moves indicate that investors think they will have little immediate effect.
The US has a particularly complex healthcare system - including a large private insurance industry, employer subsidies, and publicly funded insurance programmes for the elderly and poor, known as Medicare and Medicaid respectively.
In many other developed countries, more centralised systems mean that officials can negotiate blanket rates for drugs, and in some cases refuse to buy if they deem the price too high.
In 2021, the US Government Accounting Office made a comparison with Australia, Canada and France, external, and found that prescription drugs were on average two to four times more expensive in the US.
Politicians from both US political parties have taken aim at the costs. During Monday's White House announcement, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr noted that prices had been a preoccupation of Democrats and a main target in socialist Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns.
Both Trump in his first term and former President Joe Biden tried to tackle the issue, particularly the cost of life-saving drugs such as insulin, but US prices remain stubbornly high.
Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump and his health officials blamed the lack of progress on pharmaceutical lobbying efforts and large donations to members of Congress.
""The drug lobby is the strongest lobby,"" Trump told reporters. ""But starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the health care of foreign countries, which is what we were doing.""
It should also be noted that Trump's trade tariffs â which he has consistently used to threaten other countries - could increase costs even further. Trump has previously said he will tax drugs imported into the US.
Trump's order is much wider than previous efforts to bring down costs - however, many details are yet to be worked out.
The wording directs US officials to make sure that deals over drug costs made by foreign countries do not result in ""unreasonable or discriminatory"" price hikes for Americans.
But what exactly is covered by those terms is unclear â as is the question of what measures the White House would take if ""unreasonable"" practices are discovered.
The White House also wants drug companies to sell more products directly to consumers - cutting out insurance companies and pharmaceutical benefit managers - and look into importing drugs from foreign countries where they are sold at lower prices. That idea has previously hit stumbling blocks over safety and trade rules.
An official said that Monday's order was the start of negotiations between the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and industry.

High drug prices have been a long-running source of dissatisfaction with the US healthcare system
The order also proposed that the US be given Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status â meaning drug companies would be asked to match the lowest price for a drug abroad when selling to US consumers.
""Big pharma will either abide by this principle voluntarily or we'll use the power of the federal government to ensure that we are paying the same price as other countries,"" Trump told reporters.
It was unclear what mechanism the White House would use to punish drug companies that refuse to voluntarily comply.
Drug prices are very opaque, according to Alan Sager, a professor of health policy at Boston University. Drug manufacturers could easily argue that they were complying with the order by touting the price discounts that they already routinely provide on very high listed retail prices, he told the BBC.
""Will they act? Maybe. Will they claim they act? Sure,"" Prof Sager said.
""Whether this will signal a durable and meaningful cut in extraordinarily high US drug prices is very unclear,"" he said. ""This is rhetoric, not reality.""

Trump's preview of the announcement hit share prices of major drug makers, such as Pfizer, Eli Lilly and the UK's GSK.
But they staged a quick recovery, rallying after the administration shared the scope of its plans â an indication that investors do not expect the moves to have a major impact.
US President Donald Trump holds up his executive order as his health officials look on: (L-R) Medicare and Medicaid Administrator Mehmet Oz, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Martin Makary
To try to retain their profits in the US, drugs companies could simply pull out of other nations in which they are selling their products more cheaply, according to researchers Darius Lakdawalla and Dana Goldman at the University of Southern California.
The researchers also said that foreign governments routinely underestimated the true value of drugs to patients, and that ""shifting to a European pricing model in the US would lead to shorter, less healthy lives for Americans"".
Meanwhile, it is unclear how lower prescription drug prices would fit into Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda. The health secretary has consistently emphasised diet and exercise as the key to improving Americans' health â and has criticised the proliferation of many pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and drugs to treat mental illness.
However, any potential reduction in drug prices is likely to be popular with Americans - as polls consistently show that high costs are a top concern when it comes to the US healthcare system.
C Michael White, a pharmacy professor at the University of Connecticut, said that the results of the Trump administration's actions on drug prices ""will be minimal for many Americans"" but that any attempts towards greater transparency and lower costs ""are a positive step in the right direction"".
But the order is expected to face challenges from the pharmaceutical industry in courts and Congress.
Industry groups are largely opposed to the executive order and say it will be counterproductive â potentially choking off the supply of drugs and funds for research while doing little to quell high costs.
Stephen J Ubl, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in a statement that ""importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal"" for American patients.
John F Crowley, president of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, called MFN status ""a deeply flawed proposal that would devastate our nation's small- and mid-size biotech companies"" by potentially choking off funding for research.
""Patients and families are not a bargaining chip in a trade war, but that's exactly how they are being treated â first through proposed tariffs on our nation's medicines, now with foreign reference pricing in the name of fairness.""
But Alan Sager, the Boston University professor, was sceptical about the industry's arguments. He pointed out that the money used to research a drug was spent before any profits were made, and suggested that there might be other ways to fund research - such as large cash prizes for cures for specific diseases.
Prof Sager suggested that real action to drive down drug prices would depend on the president's attention span.
""Given the president's apparent public vacillation on many topics, it just isn't clear that he'll stay with this problem or that he'll be willing and able to act effectively,"" he said.

487,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8d1m86nzygo,2025-05-12 21:44:06,"Poland says Russia recruited arsonists for Warsaw fire on social media,","Polish Foreign Minister tells the BBC there is evidence Moscow was behind huge shopping centre fire
Poland's foreign minister says his country has evidence that Russia recruited people on the Telegram messaging service to carry out last year's massive shopping centre fire in Warsaw.
Speaking to the BBC in an exclusive interview, Radek Sikorski said Moscow's actions were ""completely unacceptable"" and that a second Russian consulate in Poland had been closed as a result. 
His comments come after a Polish investigation concluded that the Marywilska shopping centre fire was orchestrated by Moscow's intelligence services.
Russia denied its involvement, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accusing Poland of being ""Russophobic"". 
The May 2024 fire destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there belonging to Warsaw's Vietnamese community.
""We have evidence that they commissioned people living in Poland, they commissioned them on Telegram and paid them to set fire to this huge shopping mall,"" Sikorski said on Monday. 
""It was by miracle that nobody was hurt, but this is completely unacceptable.""
The foreign minister told the BBC he had decided Russia's presence in Poland must be ""further curtailed"" and that Russia's consulate in Krakow had now been closed in order to try and make it harder for Moscow to ""spy"" on Poland. 
""We will take further decisions if they continue these hybrid attacks,"" Sikorski said.
Hybrid warfare is a term used to describe how a hostile state carries out an anonymous, deniable attack, usually in highly suspicious circumstances. 
It will be enough to harm their opponent, especially their infrastructure assets, but stop short of being an attributable act of war.
Only one consulate now remains open in Poland, alongside the embassy. The mission in the city of PoznaÅ was closed last year after Warsaw accused Russia of acts of sabotage and cyberwarfare. 
When asked on Monday why Poland did not just sever all diplomatic ties, Sikorski said: ""I hope it doesn't come to that.""
Responding to the closure of the Krakow consulate, Peskov said: ""All these accusations are absolutely groundless, baseless.
""There are a lot of different accusations against Russia being voiced in Poland. This part is absolutely Russophobic and unfriendly towards our country.""
He added: ""As for the reduction of Russia's diplomatic presence in Poland, these are integral parts of a common chain aimed at curtailing the already deplorable state of bilateral relations. Poland chooses hostility and unfriendliness towards us.""
Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has detained and convicted several people accused of sabotage on behalf of Russian intelligence services.
Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, meanwhile, told state media: ""Warsaw continues to deliberately destroy relations, acting against the interests of citizens"". 
Poland carried out a year-long investigation into the shopping centre incident, before concluding the fire was organised by an unnamed person in Russia.
Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Sunday said that some of those responsible were already in custody, while all the others alleged to have been involved had been identified and were being searched for.
Many workers lost important documents and large sums of cash in the fire, which were kept at the shopping centre due to fear of break-ins at home.
Another shopping centre in Warsaw, Modlinska 6D, was opened in October last year, with traders relocating their businesses to the new site."

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said his country will respond strongly to what he describes as a future ""terrorist attack"", after four days of military exchanges with neighbouring Pakistan.
""This is not an era of war, but this is also not an era of terror,"" Modi said in his first public address since days of intense shelling and aerial incursions, carried out by both sides, began. 
These followed a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people, for which India blamed a Pakistan-based group. Islamabad has strongly denied backing the group in question.
The US-brokered ceasefire agreed between the nuclear-armed neighbours at the weekend appears to have held so far.
Both nations say they remain vigilant.
""If another terrorist attack against India is carried out, a strong response will be given,"" Modi said in his speech on Monday. 
ANALYSIS: How backchannels and US mediators pulled India and Pakistan back from the brink
""Terror and trade talks cannot happen together,"" he remarked. This was most likely a reference to comments from US President Donald Trump, who said he had told India and Pakistan his administration would only trade with them if they end the conflict.
""Water and blood cannot flow together,"" Modi added, this time referring to the suspension of a water treaty between India and Pakistan. 
His comments come after Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that his country had ""acted as a responsible state"", adding: ""Our honour, our dignity and our self-respect are more precious to us than our lives.""
He said he believed the water issue with India would be resolved through peaceful negotiations.
Narendra Modi saluted as he made his address to India on Monday evening
Earlier on Monday, top military officials from India and Pakistan discussed finer details of the ceasefire agreed between them over the weekend.
According to the Indian army, the two sides spoke about the need to refrain from any aggressive action. 
""It was also agreed that both sides consider immediate measures to ensure troop reduction from the borders and forward areas,"" it said in a statement. 
India also announced it was reopening 32 airports for civilians that it had earlier said would remain closed until Thursday due to safety concerns.
The recent tensions were the latest in the decades-long rivalry between India and Pakistan, who have fought two wars over Kashmir, a Himalayan region which they claim in full but administer in part.
The hostilities threatened to turn into a fully-fledged war as they appeared unwilling to back down for days.
Both countries have said that dozens of people from both sides died over the four days of fighting last week, partly due to heavy shelling near the de facto border.
Announcing the ceasefire on Saturday, Trump said ""it was time to stop the current aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many, and so much"".
Both India and Pakistan declared military victory after it came into effect.
On 7 May, India reported striking nine targets inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to the 22 April deadly militant attack in the picturesque Pahalgam valley. 
In the days after the first strike, India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border shelling and claimed to have shot down rival drones and aircraft in their airspace.
As the conflict escalated, both nations said they had struck the rival's military bases.
Indian officials reported striking 11 Pakistan Air Force bases, including one in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad. India also claimed Pakistan lost 35-40 men at the Line of Control - the de facto border - during the conflict and that its air force lost a few aircraft.
Pakistan has accepted that some Indian projectiles landed at its air force bases.
Indian defence forces have also said that they struck nine armed group training facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, killing more than 100 militants.
The Pakistan military, in turn, claims it targeted about 26 military facilities in India and that its drones hovered over the capital, Delhi.
India has confirmed that some Pakistani projectiles landed up at its air force bases, though it did not comment on the claim about Delhi.
Pakistan also claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft, including three French Rafales - India has not acknowledged this or commented on the number, though it said on Sunday that ""losses are a part of combat"".
Pakistan denied the claims that an Indian pilot was in its custody after she ejected following an aircraft crash. India has also said that ""all our pilots are back home"".

Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms for spying for the Kremlin in the UK and across Europe.
During a trial in London, the Old Bailey court heard the cell was paid handsomely for their services, which included spying on two journalists who had exposed nerve agent attacks on Russian dissidents Alexei Navalny and Sergei Skripal.
The sentencing judge said the group's activities had posed a serious risk to the UK's national security.
Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, was jailed for 10 years and eight months. His deputy, Biser Dzhambazov, 44, was sentenced to 10 years and two months. 
Dzhambazov's former partner, Katrin Ivanova, 33, was sentenced to nine years and eight months in prison. Three others - Tihomir Ivanchev, 39,  Ivan Stoyanov, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30 - were jailed for between six and eight years. 
Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov all pleaded guilty to the spying charges, while the other three were convicted at a trial in March.
Prosecutors had told the court they had conducted operations in the UK, Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro.
They targeted investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, as well as Russian dissidents, political figures and Ukrainian soldiers training at a military base in Germany.
The case against them was described as ""one of the largest"" foreign intelligence operations in the UK and focused on six of their assignments.
It presented, for the first time in a UK criminal court,  the inner workings of a Russian operational spy cell - exposing their thousands of messages organising surveillance, photos and videos of their targets, and talk of plans to kidnap and kill.
Evidence presented to the court this week also revealed new details about Jan Marsalek, an overseas fugitive who directed the unit for Russian intelligence services.
Marsalek, an Austrian, is currently wanted in Germany for fraud allegations linked to the financial services company Wirecard. He is believed to be hiding in Moscow.
The court heard the spy ring referred to themselves as the ""minions"", inspired by the yellow sidekicks of the villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise.
The group also frequently referred to the Russian GRU agency - its military intelligence service - in Telegram messages.
Police raided the Norfolk guesthouse housing the operation in 2023 where they found a ""treasure trove"" of gadgets, including a Minion cuddly toy containing a camera.
In sentencing on Monday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard singled out Roussev as the boss but said all were ""motivated by money"". Sums of up to â¬1m (Â£840,000) were discussed by the gang, demonstrating the ""value"" of their covert activities to Russia.
Mr Justice Hilliard said using the UK as a base to plan spy operations was a ""very serious offence"" which ""undermines this country's standing with allies"".
""Targeting journalistsâ¦ undermines freedom of the press, one of our core democratic values,"" he added.
Russia's embassy in London has not responded to the case. The Kremlin has previously always rejected allegations of spying.
Conspiracy to spy carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, but Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov were afforded some credit for their guilty pleas.
Roussev was ordered to pay a confiscation order of Â£180,768 in ill-gotten gains by August 2025. 
Meanwhile, Gaberova's sentenced was reduced to six years, eight months and three weeks following mitigation.
Her barrister Anthony Metzer KC said she had been ""controlled, coerced into this conspiracy by Mr Dzhambazov,"" who was her lover while also being involved with Ivanova. 
The court was told Gaberova had been diagnosed with depression, panic disorder, claustrophobia and anxiety.
The Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command said the case was ""a clear example"" of the increasing threat of state espionage. 
Commander Dominic Murphy said it ""highlights a relatively new phenomenon whereby espionage is being 'outsourced' by certain states"".
Security Minister Dan Jarvis said: ""These substantial sentences should send a clear warning to anyone seeking to threaten our security, harm the UK, and compromise the safety of the public."""

A community worker who comforted the mothers of two teenagers who died after getting into difficulty in water near Buncrana in County Donegal has said a ""terrible grief"" has descended on the town.
Emmanuel Familola, 16, originally from Nigeria, and 18-year-old Matt Sibanda, from Zimbabwe died on Saturday.
Ruth Garvey-Williams, from community centre The Exchange, had initially been with Matt's mother Bonnie as the tragedy unfolded before going to hospital with Emmanuel's mother Glory.
""Soon it became apparent there was not much hope of him surviving,"" she told BBC News NI.
Flowers were left at the scene in Buncrana 
The tragedy unfolded on Saturday afternoon after the Irish Coast Guard received a report of a number of people in difficulty in the water.
It is understood a group had been playing football on the beach at Ned's Point, just outside Buncrana, and some had gone into the water to retrieve a ball.
Later that evening, the body of Matt Sibanda was recovered from Lough Swilly.
Emmanuel Familola was rescued and taken to Letterkenny University Hospital but he died in the early hours of Sunday morning.
A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore.
Hundreds of people attended a special service held in their memory at St Mary's Oratory in Buncrana on Sunday while, on Monday night, up to 50 people were at a vigil in Londonderry, across the border in Northern Ireland, where flowers were thrown into the River Foyle as an act of remembrance. 
Ruth Garvey-Williams said the impact of the tragedy on the community has been profound
Mrs Garvey-Williams and her husband Andrew both volunteer at the Exchange community centre in Buncrana, which helps asylum seekers and provides English classes.
They had both initially rushed to the shorefront when news of the tragedy broke, comforting Matt's mum.
They left her in the company of friends to travel with Emmanuel's mother to hospital, where they waited by his bedside.
""The families were all praying for a miracle - sadly at 01:30 he passed away,"" she told BBC News NI.
""The doctors were incredible in ICU, they tried everythingâ¦ it was a devastating, heartbreaking moment - to be with a mother, when her oldest son was dying there,"" she said.
Both teenagers had been living with their families in separate international protection centres in Buncrana.
""These are amazing people who have fled terrible tragedies in their home countries, and have come to find safety here in Buncrana, and then to face this- it is every mothers worst nightmare,"" she said.
Mrs Garvey-Williams said the wider Buncrana community had been rallying around the families, adding the wider response has been ""heartwarming.""
Becca Bor, who attended the vigil in Derry on Monday night, said the deaths were ""every parents worst fear""
In Derry on Monday night, people came together in a vigil organised by United Against Racism - Davy McCauley, from the group, said the death of the teenagers had been ""absolutely heartbreaking"".
Noting the historically strong links between Derry and nearby Buncrana, he added: ""We live together, we mourn together - this is the real spirit of this place.""
Becca Bor, who attended the vigil, said the deaths were ""every parents worst fear"".
The boys, she said, had ""gone off to have a wonderful afternoon, a fun time with each other and they don't come home"".
""It is an absolute nightmare.""
Earlier on Monday, Joe Joyce, of the RNLI Lough Swilly lifeboat station, described the traumatic scenes as families watched helplessly amid efforts to locate the missing teenage boys.
Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said dozens joined the search including Malin Head Coast Guard, the Irish Coast Guard helicopter and a former RNLI crew member, who was on the lough in his own personal boat. 
""There was a local yacht race happening that day, and they stopped that and assisted with the search,"" he said.
""It was terribly traumatic to look at the families watching out over the lough and praying.""
The third teenage boy was helped out of the water ""with the assistance of a local man"" and was able to ""scramble"" onto the coastal pathway, Mr Joyce added.
Joe Joyce says the area is a popular swimming spot and that waters can change dramatically and quickly
Mr Joyce said support services have been put in place following the incident. 
""The schools have opened up to give counselling and we are looking after our own team, and everyone is just shocked.
""There was an eeriness that hung over the pier â it was a terrible scene.""
Mr Joyce said the area is a popular swimming spot and noted that waters can change dramatically and quickly.
Fr Francis Bradley said the tragedy is ""truly unspeakable""
Fr Francis Bradley said he was present alongside the family of Matt Sibanda.
He described the experience of standing beside the child's mother at the shoreline as ""unspeakably tough"".
""We simply said a prayer with Matt's mother, out over the water, simply begging God that his body would be found,"" he said.
""The power of a mother's love is amazing, as I stood there and listened to her call out Matt's name, trying her best to bring him back to life, as she once gave him life.""
The principals of Scoil Mhuire and Crana College delivered a joint statement to the media
Evelyn McLoughlin, principal of Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana where Emmanuel was a pupil, said there were ""no words"" that could ""fully capture the pain and sorrow that we are feeling"".
Kevin Cooley, principal of Crana College, where Matt attended, said ""there is a dark cloud of sadness over Buncrana"".
A number of tributes have been paid to Emmanuel Familola and Matt Sibanda
Councillor FionÃ¡n Bradley, who knew Emmanuel personally, said he was ""a beautiful person inside and out"".
""Since Saturday evening a real cloud of gloom and darkness, and a real sombre air has been over the whole town and whole community.""
Last week Emmanuel had taken part in the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs Global Ireland Young Leaders programme.
After completing the programme Emmanuel wrote: ""I had the amazing opportunity to meet the Ambassador of Ireland and visit the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade â including the passport office! 
""It was such a great experience learning about Ireland's work around the world. Grateful for the warm welcome and inspiring day.""
In a statement, the department said it was ""shocked and saddened"" to learn of his death.
""He was one of 30 Transition Year students from across the country learning about the work of the department and meeting officials engaged in different parts of its work,"" a spokesperson said.

After 40 years, with 40,000 people killed, and without securing a Kurdish homeland, the banned Kurdistan Workers Party, the PKK, is ending its war against the Turkish state.
This signals the end of one of the longest conflicts in the world - a historic moment for Turkey, its Kurdish minority, and neighbouring countries into which the conflict has spilled over.
A spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party said it was an important step towards a country free of terror.
But what will the PKK get for disarming and disbanding? So far the government has made no promises â publicly at least.
Sheltering inside a tea shop from a sudden violent hail storm that battered the ancient city of Diyabakir, Necmettin Bilmez, 65, a driver, was sceptical about what might follow. 
""They [the government] have been tricking us for thousands of years,"" he said.
""When I get an ID card in my pocket saying I am Kurdish, I will believe everything will be solved. Otherwise, I don't believe in this.""
Sitting nearby on a small woven stool, Mehmet Ek, 80, had a different view.  
""This has come late,"" he said. 
""I wish it had happened ten years ago. But still anyone from any side who will stop this bloodshed, I salute them,"" he said, tipping the top of his flat cap.
""This conflict is brother on brother. The one who dies in the mountains [PKK] is ours and the soldier [from the government] is ours.
""We are all losing, Turks and Kurds.""
He wants an amnesty for PKK fighters â like many here - and the release of jailed Kurdish politicians.
""If all that happens it will be a beautiful peace,"" he said. 
Mehmet Ek told the BBC the move should have been taken earlier as he called for jailed Kurdish politicians to be released.
In this majority Kurdish city in south-eastern Turkey - the de facto Kurdish capital - we found a muted response to PKK's announcement. 
The city has been scarred and reshaped by the conflict.  
Turkish forces and the PKK battled in the heart of Diyarbakir in 2015. You can still see the rubble of buildings flattened by the Turkish army. 
Many local people told us they welcomed peace, or the idea of it, and wanted no more deaths - Turkish or Kurdish.
""No one has achieved anything,"" said Ibrahim Nazlican, 63, drinking tea in the shade of the towering city walls, which have guarded Diyarbakir since Roman times.
""There is nothing but harm and loss, on this side and on that side. There are no winners.""
The conflict has ranged from the mountains of northern Iraq â which became PKK headquarters in recent years - to Turkey's biggest cities. 
Outside an Istanbul football stadium in 2016, a PKK affiliate carried out a double bombing killing 38 police officers and 8 civilians. Many Kurds and Turks are hoping this is the end of a dark chapter, which has claimed 40,000 lives
Some have called for the release of PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan who is currently imprisoned on an island off of Istanbul.
The PKK decision lay down its arms followed a call in February by its jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who said there was ""no alternative to democracy"".
For now, the 76-year-old remains in his cell in an island prison off of Istanbul, where he has been held since 1999.
To his supporters, he remains a heroic figure who has put their cause on a global agenda. They want him released.
LISTEN: The Global Jigsaw on The Kurdish issue
Menice, 47, is among them. She insisted his release was the key to a new dawn for the Kurds, who account for up to 20% of the Turkish population.
""We want peace, but if our leader is not free, we will never be free,"" she said. 
""If he is free, we will all be free and the Kurdish problem will be solved.""
Menice lost her eldest son during a Turkish airstrike after he joined the PKK. 
She is surrounded by family photos of loved ones who have died fighting for the PKK - which is classed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the UK, the US and the EU.  
She has lost five relatives including her brother and her oldest son Zindan. 
He joined the PKK at 17, and was dead at 25, killed in a Turkish airstrike three years ago.  
Menice's eyes fill with tears as she tells us how he used to help her with the housework.
His path may have been mapped out from birth.  
""We named him Zindan [meaning cell] because his father was in prison when he was born,"" she told us.
One large photograph hangs on the wall shows Zindan alongside his brother, Berxwendan, who followed his footsteps ""up the mountain"" to the PKK, when he reached the age of 17.
Berxwenden is now 23. His mother did not know if he was alive or dead until he sent his family a photo of himself during Ramadan in March.
Menice is hoping her surviving son may now come back.
""I hope Berxwendan and his friends will come home. As a mother, I want peace. Let there be no killings. Hasn't there been enough suffering for everyone?""
But does she believe that there can be peace between Turkey and the Kurds?
""I believe in us, in Ocalan, and our nation [the Kurds],"" she said firmly.   
""The enemy [the Turkish authorities] has forced us not to believe in them.""
However, pro-Kurdish political parties have some leverage.
Erdogan needs their support to enable him to run for a third term as president in elections due in 2028.
For its part, the PKK has been hit hard by the Turkish military in recent years with leaders and fighters hunted down in drone warfare.  
And regional change, in Iran and Syria, means the militant group and its affiliates have less freedom to operate.
Both sides have their reasons for doing a deal now. That may be grounds for hope."

A man who live streamed real-time acts of child sexual abuse from the Philippines and shared indecent images of children has been jailed for four years.
Darren Ashton, from Washford in Somerset, regularly accessed the websites and discussed the sharing of images and videos of male children aged 13 and 14.
National Crime Agency (NCA) officers arrested Ashton, 52, at his home following intelligence from the National Bureau of Investigation in the Philippines.
""Ashton was abusing children over the internet, encouraging them to send images and videos, and watching live streamed and real time child sexual abuse from the Philippines,"" said NCA operations manager, Danielle Pownall.
""Live streaming exploits vulnerable children and Ashton's offending means he is directly responsible for the harm it causes them,"" she added.
Ashton called himself 'Daz from England' online.
He was found to have asked a Singaporean child aged around 11 for indecent pictures in a deleted conversation that was recovered from his phone.
In total - 185 Category A, 244 Category B, 266 Category C and 10 extreme or prohibited indecent images were recovered from his electronic devices.
Ashton initially denied the charges in a police interview but pleaded guilty at Taunton Crown Court on 13 February.
He will also be permanently added to the Sex Offenders Register and is subject to an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

When the Philippines voted on Monday, Sara Duterte's name was not on the ballot. 
But the results of the election, which includes 12 senate races, impacts her political future. 
It affects both her role as the Philippines' current vice-president and any hopes she might have of running for the country's presidency one day, as she faces the prospect of a ban from politics - decided by lawmakers in the Senate. 
The 46-year-old is the eldest daughter of the Philippines' former President Rodrigo Duterte. She trained as a lawyer before entering politics in 2007, when she was elected as her father's vice-mayor in their family's hometown Davao.
Rodrigo Duterte has described her as the ""alpha"" character of the family, who always gets her way. 
The younger Duterte was filmed in 2011 punching a court official in the face after he refused her request, leading one local news outlet to bestow the nickname of ""the slugger"" upon her. 
She and her father are known to share similar traits, as well as a passion for riding big motorbikes. Sara is said to be her father's favourite child, though she has also said they share a ""love-hate relationship"".
One cable from the US embassy in Manila in 2009, leaked by Wikileaks, described her as ""a tough-minded individual who, like her father, is difficult to engage"".
Follow live updates: Millions vote in Philippines midterms as Marcos-Duterte feud heats up
Marcos and Duterte won by a landslide in the 2022 election
Born in 1978, Sara is Rodrigo Duterte's second child with his first wife, flight attendant Elizabeth Zimmerman. 
In 1999 she graduated with a major in BS Respiratory Therapy. During her inauguration as vice-president in 2022, she said that in her youth she was ""consumed by a dream to become a doctor"" but was ""directed toward another way"".
In 2005 she graduated with a law degree and passed the Philippine Bar Examination. But it wasn't long before her father expressed his wish for her to enter politics as his running mate in mayoral elections - hoping that if and when he ran for president, Sara would help protect his mayoral legacy.
Rodrigo would only go ahead with his presidential bid once Sara had agreed to succeed him as mayor of Davao - and in 2010, at 32, she succeeded her father to become the city's first female mayor. 
In response to many people's apparent confusion as to how they should address her, Sara Duterte ended her inaugural address with a specific appeal: ""call me Inday Sara"".
""Inday"", an honorific in the south, means a respected elder woman. It also played into the Duterte's optics: of a family from the regional south facing off against imperial Manila. 
In Manila, ""inday"" was previously used to refer to house help from the south - but Sara reclaimed the term. Now even her father calls her by that name.
Sara Duterte greets her father Rodrigo after taking her oath as the next vice-president
It was in 2021 that Sara decided to make her way to national politics. 
The next year she ran on a joint ticket with the scion of another political dynasty - Ferdinand Marcos Jr. He was going for the top job, with Duterte as his deputy.
The assumption was that she would then be in a prime position to contest the next presidential election in 2028, as presidents are limited only to one six-year term in the Philippines.
The strategy proved effective and the duo won by a landslide. But then it quickly started to unravel.
Cracks started to emerge in their alliance even before the euphoria of their election win faded. Duterte publicly expressed her preference to be defence secretary but she was instead handed the education portfolio.
The House of Representatives soon after scrutinised Duterte's request for confidential funds - millions of pesos that she could spend without stringent documentation.
Then, Rodrigo Duterte spoke at a late night rally, accusing President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos of being a junkie and a weak leader.
Soon after, First Lady Liza Marcos snubbed Sara Duterte at an event, in full view of news cameras. She admitted that it was intentional, saying Duterte should not have stayed silent in the background while her father accused the president of drug use.
After Duterte resigned from the cabinet in July last year, her language became increasingly inflammatory.
She said she had ""talked to someone"" to ""go kill"" Marcos, his wife and his cousin, who is also the speaker of the House. She also told reporters her relationship with Marcos had become toxic and she dreamed of cutting off his head.
Such remarks are shocking for someone who is not acquainted with Philippine politics. But Duterte's strong personality has only endeared her to the public and she remains popular in the south, as well as among the millions of overseas Filipino workers. 
Sara Duterte speaks outside the International Criminal Court (ICC) on the day of her father's hearing in the Hague
But in February this year, lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted to impeach Duterte, accusing her of misusing public funds and threatening to have President Marcos assassinated. 
She will be tried by the Senate and, if found guilty, removed from office and banned from running in future elections.
Duterte has denied the charges and alleges she is the victim of a political vendetta. 
Another blow came in March when her father was arrested and extradited to the Hague over the thousands of killings during his war on drugs. She then flew to the Netherlands to meet him while he was in custody. 
He is still in jail, awaiting trial, but has been elected mayor of Davao in one of several local races that also took place on Monday.
Rodrigo Duterte's arrest was a big part of his daughter's campaign for her senate picks, with Sara and the candidates often chanting ""bring him home"".
Those candidates included two key family loyalists who look set to win their seats, according to early, partial results.
This would be an important victory for Sara, because the composition of the house determines whether or not she will be impeached. 
For her to be impeached, two-thirds of the Senate would need to vote for it. 
But Monday's results, which include some surprise wins, make it harder to predict the outcome of the trial.   
For now, Sara Duterte's fate hangs in the balance."

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has been dealt an unexpected blow in the midterms, with his Senate candidates set to pick up fewer seats than expected, according to early results. 
The election was a showdown between Marcos and his Vice-President Sara Duterte, daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte.  
The pair, who represent the country's most powerful families, won the 2022 election together - but their alliance has since collapsed. 
Monday's election, which included multiple races from the council to the Congress,  was an important test for 67-year-old Marcos, the son of an ousted dictator who rebranded his father's reign to make a comeback in the 2022 election.
Born in 1957 to Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, Bongbong was just eight years old when his father became president. He was the second of three children, and the only son. The couple later adopted another girl.
Bongbong's father, a former lawyer, served in the Congress and Senate, while his mother was a singer and former beauty pageant winner. Both would achieve notoriety - as the family amassed enormous wealth under a brutal regime, they became synonymous with excess and corruption. 
During his first term between 1965 and 1969, Ferdinand Marcos Sr was fairly popular, and was re-elected by a landslide. But in 1972, a year before his second term was due to end, he declared martial law.
What followed was more than a decade of dictatorship, during which the country's foreign debt grew, prices soared and ordinary Filipinos struggled to make ends meet.  It was also a period of repression as opposition figures and critics were jailed, disappeared or killed. 
Through it all, Marcos Sr was grooming his son for leadership.
Bongbong's childhood bedroom in llocos Norte, the family's stronghold in the north, which is now a museum, has a portrait of him wearing a golden crown and riding a white stallion. 
But the elder Marcos was also worried about whether his son would step up to the role. A diary entry from 1972 read: ""Bongbong is our principal worry. He is too carefree and lazy"". 
In the Marcos's last public appearance before they fled the country, Bongbong, standing on the far right, was 28
Marcos enrolled in Oxford University to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics, but it was later revealed that he did not graduate with a bachelor's degree as he claimed.
Oxford said in 2021 that he was awarded a special diploma in social studies in 1978. That too, local media reports alleged, was the result of lobbying by Philippine diplomats in the UK after Marcos Jr failed his exams.
He returned home and joined politics, becoming the vice-governor and then governor of Ilocos Norte. 
But the political career his parents had envisioned for him would be cut short by a revolution in 1986.
An economic crisis had already triggered unrest - but the assassination of a prominent opposition leader brought tens of thousands onto the streets. 
A sustained campaign eventually convinced a significant faction of the army to withdraw its support for the Marcos regime, and hastened its downfall. 
Imelda Marcos' infamous shoe collection
The family fled to Hawaii with whatever valuables they could bring, but left behind enough proof of the lavish lives they had led. 
Protesters who stormed the presidential palace found fanciful oil portraits of the family, a jacuzzi with gold-plated fixtures and the now-infamous 3,000 pairs of designer shoes owned by Imelda Marcos.
The family is accused of plundering an estimated $10bn of public money while in power. By the time Marcos Sr died in exile in 1989, his was a tarnished name. 
And yet, some three decades later, his son was able to whitewash that past enough to win the presidential election. 
After they returned to the Philippines in the 1990s, Marcos became a provincial governor, congressman and senator, before running - and winning - the presidential race in 2022.
Social media was a big part of this rebranding, winning Marcos new supporters - especially among the younger generation in a country where the median age is around 25.
On Facebook, the Marcos family legacy has been rewritten, with propaganda posts claiming that Marcos Sr's regime was actually a ""golden period"" for the country. 
On TikTok, a martial law anthem from the Marcos Sr era became the soundtrack to a cute challenge for Gen Z users, who would record older family members marching to the beat.
As his popularity grew, Marcos launched his presidential bid with Sara Duterte running for vice-president. She vowed to work with Bongbong to unify the country and make it ""rise again"". 
They called themselves the ""uniTeam"", and combined the two families' powerful bases: the Dutertes in the south, and the Marcos's in the north. 
Marcos Jr with his mother Imelda (second from left) and his wife and son
It paid off. Marcos won with a thumping 31 million votes, more than double the total of his closest rival.
""Judge me not by my ancestors, but by my actions,"" Marcos said as victory became apparent, vowing to ""be a president for all Filipinos"".
Three years into his presidency, Marcos has brought Manila closer to the US and increasingly confronted an assertive China in the South China Sea - a key departure from Duterte's presidency. 
That wasn't the only thing that caused a crack in his alliance with Sara Duterte, which eventually descended into a public spat.  
He gave her the Education portfolio, when she had openly sought the more powerful Defence portfolio. His allies in Congress then initiated impeachment proceedings against her over alleged misuse of state funds. 
And Marcos cleared the way for her father to be arrested and taken to the Hague for his role in a deadly war on drugs that killed thousands.   
Marcos, experts say, took a big risk by picking a fight with the Dutertes - for it to pay off, control of the senate was crucial. 
But the midterm results complicate his chances - and his political future."

Garda Commissioner (head of the Irish police force) Drew Harris has called for ""a real reset"" when it comes to road safety.
It follows the death of Garda Kevin Flatley, 49, on Sunday whilst carrying out a speed checkpoint in County Dublin.
Garda Flatley died at the scene after he was hit by a motorcyclist in Lanestown, in the north of the county, shortly before 13:00 local time on Sunday.
A motorcyclist, a man in his 30s, was seriously injured in the incident and has been taken to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin where his condition is described as critical.
Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Mr Harris said it was a ""desperately sad day for An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na"".
Drew Harris was speaking at a press conference on Sunday
Mr Harris confirmed that investigations are ongoing into his death.
He highlighted ""the dangers there are for those who engage in road policing"". 
It was reported that another garda member was also hit by a motorcycle in Coolock and broke his leg on Sunday. 
One man was arrested. 
A third Garda was also injured on duty last week when he was hit by a car.
The Commissioner said that ""this is a regular occurrence"".
""The dangers our members are facing is just extraordinary.
""I acknowledge the tougher sentences that have been put in place by the government, but also this does call for a real reset and rethink about our approach as a society in terms of road safety.
""We know what causes dangers on the road,"" he said.
""Every one of us has a responsibility when we go out on the road. Our roads are busy, they are not a place for dangerous driving.""
GardaÃ­ also renewed their appeal for information and dash cam footage.
The Commissioner said a number of people had come forward but they were still seeking information on the movements of the R1 Yamaha Motorcycle from around midday on Sunday, in the hour before Garda Flatley was killed.
Irish flag flying at half-mast at Dublin Metropolitan Regional Headquarters at Dublin Castle
BBC News NI Dublin reporter Kevin Sharkey reports:
Garda Kevin Flatley, who was a member of the roads policing unit based at Dublin Castle, is the 90th member of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na to be killed on duty.
The 89 other garda victims lost their lives on duty for a variety of reasons including incidents relating to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, while on anti-crime operations, and in accidents.
A common denominator in all 90 cases has been the impact of each Garda death on the public consciousness in Ireland.
Today, the Irish national flag is flying at half-mast outside the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Regional Headquarters at Dublin Castle.
Speaking on RTÃ's Morning Ireland programme, external, the Garda Representative Association Vice President Niall Hodgins said: ""It's dreadful day for everybody that serves for An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na.""
Mr Hodgins added that he has been ""inundated with calls"" paying tribute to Garda Flatley.
He added that later on Monday ""we will all gather, with broken hearts to remember our dear colleague, friend and teammate"".
""He wore his uniform with dignity, courage and pride.""
The GAA club in Balbriggan of which Garda Flatley and his family were members have paid tribute to him.
In a statement O'Dwyer's GAA club said: ""Kevin was an absolute gentleman who had a huge part to play in our club, always lending a hand when he could. He was always a pleasure to chat to, and his grÃ¡ (love) for GAA and helping others shone through in every conversation. 
""He was a dedicated coach with our u10 girls team, encouraging the players at all times and bringing great energy,"" the statement said.
They extended their ""deepest of condolences"" to Garda Flatley's family.
The club's chairperson Dave Rooney told RTÃ's Morning Ireland programme: ""It is a terrible day for our club and the wider community of Balbriggan.""
Mr Rooney, who also coached with Garda Flatley said he was ""very active within the community and the club"".
He added the club will hold a minute's silence and pause games to pay tribute.
""We will also support [his wife] Ãna and the family when the funeral arrangements are announced,"" added Mr Rooney.
Ireland's justice minister Jim O'Callaghan expressed his sympathy to Garda Flatley's family.
""It was a terrible tragedy that he lost his life in the line of duty but it emphasises the sacrifices and the dangers associated with policing in Ireland,"" O'Callaghan said.
Speaking about the incident involving Garda Flatley and the other incident in Coolock, O'Callaghan said: ""I will implement whatever new measures are required in order to ensure gardaÃ­ are as safe as possible during their roads policing."""

China's defiance as it faced down US President Donald Trump's tariffs has been a defining image of this trade war.
It has prompted viral memes of Trump waiting for the Chinese leader to call.
""We will not back down,"" has been an almost daily message from Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As the tariffs and the rhetoric from Washington escalated, China dug its heels in.
Even as Chinese officials headed to Switzerland for talks, a state-run social media account published a cartoon of the US Treasury secretary pushing an empty shopping trolley.
There were even conflicting versions of who initiated the talks in Geneva.
But after two days of ""robust"" talks, the situation appears to have changed.
So, is this a major turning point for Washington and Beijing? The answer is yes and no.
Faisal Islam: US and China step back from beyond brink
'We don't care': A defiant China looks beyond Trump's America
""The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,"" said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a press conference in Geneva.
""And what had occurred with these very high tariffs... was the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade.""
Economists admit that this agreement is better than expected.
""I thought tariffs would be cut to somewhere around 50%,"" Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management in Hong Kong, told Reuters news agency.
But in fact, US tariffs on Chinese imports will now fall to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on US goods will drop to 10%.
""Obviously, this is very positive news for economies in both countries and for the global economy, and makes investors much less concerned about the damage to global supply chains in the short term,"" he added.
Trump hailed the progress on Sunday on his Truth Social site: ""Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner.""
Beijing has also softened its tone considerablyâ and perhaps for good reason. 
China can take the pain of an economic war with America â to an extent. It is the lead trade partner for more than 100 other countries. 
But officials have become increasingly concerned about the impact the tariffs could have on an economy that is already struggling to deal with a property crisis, stubbornly high youth unemployment and low consumer confidence.
Factory output has slowed and there are reports that some companies are having to lay off workers as production lines of US-bound goods grind to a halt, bringing trade to a standstill.
Data on Saturday showed China's consumer price index dropped 0.1 percent in April, the third month in a row of decline as consumers hold back from spending and businesses drop prices to compete for customers.
American company Apple was among those most exposed to the impact of tariff proposals as it relies on a production line that had been based in China
The Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Monday that the agreement reached with the US was an important step to ""resolve differences"" and ""lay the foundation to bridge differences and deepen cooperation"".
Such a positive statement from Beijing would have seemed inconceivable just a month ago.
The two sides have also agreed to more talks, or an ""economic and trade consultation mechanism"", as Beijing puts it.
But Trump's characterisation of a ""total reset"" in relations may be overly optimistic as there is a slight sting in the tail in Beijing's statement.
The Commerce Ministry ended with a reminder of who it sees as being in the wrong.
""We hope that the US will continue to work with China to meet each other halfway based on this meeting, thoroughly correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff increases,"" said the spokesperson.
Chinese state media also had a warning for Washington. Xinhua News Agency's commentary claimed China's ""goodwill and patience has its limits, and it will never be used on those who repress and blackmail us without pause or have no qualms about going back on their word"".
Leaders in Beijing will want to portray an image of strength both to its own people and to the international community. They will want to appear as if they have not budged an inch. The message from China is that it is being responsible and rational and doing what it can to avoid a global recession.
Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war
""This is a victory for conscience and rationality,"" said Zhang Yun from the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.
""The talks also established the necessary framework for continued dialogue and negotiations in the future.""
This ""victory"" is only for 90 days. The tariffs are only paused temporarily to allow for negotiations.
It will allow some trade to flow, and it will soothe worried markets.
But the root of the problem still exists. China still sells far more to the United States than it buys. And there are other, far thornier differences to unpick, from Chinese government subsidies, to key industries, to geopolitical tensions in the Taiwan Strait and beyond.
The fight for a more balanced trade relationship is far from over â it has simply moved.
The frontline has shifted from China's factory floors and American supermarkets to negotiating tables in both Beijing and Washington."

Search efforts for a British hiker who has been missing for more than a week in New Zealand have been ""paused"", police have said. 
Eli Sweeting, 25, who is originally from Bristol, was reported missing on 4 May after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak, a steep mountain on the country's South Island. 
A large-scale search was launched with teams of local volunteers alongside helicopters and search dogs, and some of his family flying out to help.
But on Monday afternoon, local time, Insp Matt Scoles, acting commander for the district, said police had made the ""difficult decision"" to pause search efforts. 
""We have been supporting the tramper's [hiker's] family and we know this is difficult news for them to hear at what has been an incredibly distressing time,"" he said.
""While the search has now been paused, we will be reviewing our efforts and looking to see if there is anything further we can do.""
Police described the terrain around Mitre Peak as ""extremely dangerous"" 
In a fundraising post, Mr Sweeting's sister, Serena Sweeting, said he was an ""experienced climber"" who had ""hiked in this terrain many times"".
She added: ""Eli is one of the kindest, most compassionate people in my life, and he has always been there for me.
""He inspires me to live and get out of my comfort zone, as well as listens and genuinely wants to know you and your story.""
Insp Coles said the Milford Sound area, where the search had been focused, was ""extremely dangerous and challenging terrain"". 
""We have focussed on searching the route used by climbers as well as an aerial search of the entire area using two helicopters and thermal imagery. Additionally a drone has also been deployed,"" he said.
The search party had focused on a route heading down the mountain after spotting a light there, but the dense forest created issues with detecting movement.
Police remain in frequent contact with the family, Insp Coles added.
A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it is in contact with local authorities in New Zealand.

Crates containing documents from Nazi Germany have been rediscovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court.
The unusual find was made as workers were clearing the building's basement ahead of its archives being moved to a newly created museum.
The documents were sent by the German embassy in Tokyo and arrived in Argentina on 20 June 1941 inside 83 diplomatic pouches aboard a Japanese steamship, according to information gathered by court officials.
They ended up in the Supreme Court that same year after they were confiscated by Argentine customs officials who had opened five pouches at random and found Nazi propaganda material inside.

The crates were quickly moved to a secure office in the building and court officials alerted the Buenos Aires Holocaust Museum to their existence and asked for its help in creating an inventory of all their contents. 
Photos published by the court show the experts sifting through black-and-white photos and membership booklets bearing swastikas on their covers. 
Among the contents were photographs and membership booklets
Historians hope the documents will yield clues to the Nazis' financial networks and their international ties.
In a statement, Argentina's Supreme Court revealed the information it had managed to piece together so far.
It said the documents, which arrived in Argentina on board the Nan-a-Maru steamship from Tokyo in June 1941, had been declared as ""personal effects"" by the German embassy in Buenos Aires at the time. 
However, Argentine custom officials were suspicious because of the size of the shipment and alerted the Argentine foreign minister, fearing it could contain material which could endanger Argentina's neutral stance in World War Two at the time. 
Five of the pouches were opened at random and found to contain postcards, photographs and Nazi propaganda material.
The German embassy in Buenos Aires requested that the pouches be sent back to its embassy in Tokyo - from where they had been sent in the first place - but an Argentine judge ordered in September 1941 that all of the 83 pouches be seized.
Argentina's Supreme Court was tasked with the decision as to what to do with them next but it appears no decision was made before 1944 - when Argentina broke relations with the Axis powers - explaining how the crates ended up gathering dust in the court's basement for decades. 
After the end of World War Two, Argentina - under the leadership of Juan PerÃ³n - became a place of refuge for a number of high-ranking Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele. 
In 2000, President Fernando de la RÃºa officially apologised for his country's role in harbouring Nazi war criminals."

At least 130 civilians were killed by Burkina Faso government forces and allied militia in March near the western town of Solenzo, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says in a new report., external
It says the ""massacre"", following an operation led by BurkinabÃ¨ special forces, resulted in widespread civilian deaths and displacement of ethnic Fulanis.
The Fulani are a pastoralist, largely Muslim community who the government has often accused of backing Islamist militants - an allegation denied by community leaders.
About 40% of Burkina Faso, external is under the control of groups linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State operating in West Africa's Sahel region.
The attacks, in which thousands of people have been killed and millions displaced, have continued despite promises by the country's military leaders to deal with the insurgency.
Ahead of the release of the HRW findings on Monday, there were reports of more militant attacks over the weekend with dozens of military and civilian casualties. 
The BBC has not been able to confirm these reports and the authorities do not routinely comment on reported jihadist attacks.
The BBC has approached the Burkina Faso government for comment on the HRW report.
Last year, the government described as ""baseless"" another HRW report that had accused soldiers of a ""massacre"" in which 223 villagers were killed.
It also said that any allegations of human rights abuses committed ""in the fight against terrorism"" were systematically investigated.
Why Burkina Faso's junta leader has captured hearts and minds around the world
Why West Africa has more 'terror deaths' than rest of world combined
The rights group says it interviewed witnesses, militia members, journalists and the civil society and analysed videos shared on social media to make the findings regarding the army's involvement in the March killings.
HRW previously said the army was ""implicated"" in the killings, based on videos that were being shared online showing dozens of dead and injured people, although the findings were not definitive.
It now says further research has ""uncovered that Burkina Faso's military was responsible for these mass killings of Fulani civilians"". 
It adds that least 100 more civilians were killed last month in reprisal attacks by jihadist groups against those seen as helping the military.
""Mass killings of civilians by government security forces, militias, and Islamist armed groups amount to war crimes and other possible atrocity crimes,"" it says.
The rights group has urged the government to investigate and prosecute all those responsible for the crimes. 
This came as junta leader Capt Ibrahim TraorÃ© returned from Moscow after a Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin on cooperation and security in the Sahel.
Since the military seized power, Burkina Faso has turned away from colonial power France and towards Russia for help in tacking the Islamist insurgency.

For Maria Khan, the ceasefire this weekend between India and Pakistan came too late.
Maria, who lives in Indian-administered Kashmir, lost her nephew and niece - 12-year-old twins Zain Ali and Urwa Fatima - to cross-border shelling on 7 May. Their parents, her sister Urusa and brother-in-law Rameez Khan, were also injured and are still in hospital.
Hours earlier that day, India had launched a series of strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation for an earlier militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.
The strikes were followed by a series of military actions from Islamabad and Delhi that went on till Saturday, including heavy cross-border shelling and drone strikes.
People living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de-factor border between India and Pakistan, were the most vulnerable as shells fell near their homes.
Maria, who lives in Poonch, a town in Indian-administered Kashmir near the LoC, is among dozens of people who lost family members in the conflict.
A photo of the twins celebrating their birthday
India has said that 16 people were killed on the morning of 7 May in the shelling by Pakistan. Pakistan has said that at least 30 civilians have died since India launched its retaliatory strikes in the early hours of 7 May.
On 6 May, like every other day, Zain and Urwa came back from school, did their homework, played a bit, had dinner and then went to sleep.
It wasn't yet dawn when the Khan family heard the sound of gunfire just a few kilometres away from their home.
Terrified, they hunkered down at home and waited for a relative to come pick them up, Maria says.
""My sister was holding Urwa's hand and my brother-in-law was holding Zain's hand. They had just left the house when suddenly a shell exploded [nearby]. The splinters hit them - Urva died right there and Zain was flung somewhere in the force of the explosion,"" Maria says.
She adds that her sister kept calling out to Zain. When she finally spotted him, a stranger was performing CPR on the boy, trying to revive him. But he was unsuccessful.

Meanwhile, Rameez, who lay bleeding and unconscious, was rushed to hospital - first a local one in Poonch and later to a bigger hospital in Rajouri, about four hours away.
Since his injuries were serious, he was shifted again to a hospital in Jammu city, another four-hour journey.
The grave of the twins who were killed in the cross-border shelling
Maria says that Urwa and Zain were the centre of their parents' lives. Rameez, a teacher, wanted to give them the best education they could get and hence, they shifted to a house that was closer to the children's school, called Christ School.
On 9 May, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press briefing that during heavy shelling along the LoC, a Pakistani shell had fallen behind Christ School in Poonch town and exploded.
Rameez, Maria says, still doesn't know about the deaths of his children as the family doesn't want to upset him.
After the shelling on 7 May, hundreds of people left Poonch and other border towns to escape to safer areas. They are slowly returning after the ceasefire.
""The government should have informed people living near border areas earlier, so that they could leave from there and go to a safe place. Perhaps then our children would have been with us today,"" she says.
""If war is necessary for the country's security, we support it,"" says Maria. 
""We are also saddened by the Pahalgam attack, but we should also think about the lives of those living near the border. Are we not humans?"" she asks.
""Now, whether there is a war or ceasefire, our children will not come back.""

Both China and the United States have said they have made progress at trade talks between the two countries in Switzerland. 
The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as ""productive and constructive,"" while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were ""in-depth"" and ""candid"".
The White House called it a ""trade deal"" but gave no further details. A joint statement with full details is expected on Monday.
The pair were engaged in secretive closed-door discussions all weekend, in the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China on its goods entering America in January.
The talks were the first face-to-face meetings between the two countries since President Trump imposed a 145% tariff on Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with a 125% levy on some US goods.
The huge tariffs caused turmoil in the financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.
Following the conclusion of the two-day talks in Geneva, US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer said ""the deal we struck with our Chinese partners"" would help reduce the US's $1.2tn (Â£901bn) trade deficit. 
Bessent said the US and China had made ""substantial progress"" on de-escalating the trade war, while Vice Premier He said the talks were ""of great significance to the two countries but also have an important impact on the stability and development of the global economy"".
Vice Premier He said the two sides had reached a series of major consensuses, and had also agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism.
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, inspector general of the World Trade Organization, called the talks ""a significant step forward"" and urged both countries to ""build on this momentum"".
Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong rose on Monday, while US stock markets are also expected to open higher when trading starts later. The Chinese currency, the yuan, strengthened against the US dollar.
Frank Lavin, former undersecretary for international trade at the US Department of Commerce, told the BBC's Business Today programme he expected the two countries to cut tariffs although they would remain ""way above historical norms"".
Andrew Wilson, the deputy secretary general of the International Chamber of Commerce, said the current tariff levels needed to be reduced substantially.
While he said the comments from the weekend were ""very positive"", if tariffs remained above 20% that would ""still be severely disruptive to international trade flows"".
""I think we need to be setting 30% as a benchmark, ideally going down towards 20%.""
Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, said the so-called reciprocal tariffs ""could be addressed, but probably not"".
""I think mostly what I expect is an agreement to keep talking,"" she said on the BBC's Newsday programme.
On Saturday, following the first day of talks Trump had praised the ""total reset"" on the relationship between the two countries.
In a social media post, the US president described the talks as being ""very good"" and said change had been ""negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner"".
""We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!"" Trump added.
On Friday, before the talks began, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions. 
Both sides issued various other warnings ahead of the meeting, with Beijing saying the US must ease tariffs while Bessent stressed that the focus was on ""de-escalation"" and this was not a ""big trade deal"".
Chinese state media reported that Beijing had decided to engage with the US after fully considering global expectations, the country's interests and appeals from American businesses.
Last month, the BBC found that Chinese exporters were struggling with the US's tariffs - one company, Sorbo Technology, reported that half of its products were normally sold to the US and were now sat in boxes in a warehouse in China. 
Meanwhile, the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year - contracting at an annual rate of 0.3% - as firms raced to get goods into the country.
The trade war between China and the US intensified last month after President Trump announced a universal baseline tariff on all imports to the United States, on what he called ""Liberation Day"".
Around 60 trading partners, which the White House described as the ""worst offenders"", were subjected to higher rates than others. The list included China and the European Union.
Trump said this was payback for years worth of unfair trade policies for the US.
He also separately announced a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium coming into the US, and a further 25% tariff on all cars and car parts.
It was announced last week that the US and UK had agreed a deal, in which the 25% tariff will be cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars - matching the number of cars the UK exported last year."

Hamas says it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who is believed to be the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement.
The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Hamas said it was also intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid. Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days.
Earlier a senior Hamas official told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group was holding direct negotiations with a US administration official in Qatar.
The Israeli PM's office said it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a ""safe corridor"" for Mr Alexander's release.
Benjamin Netanyahu's office said preparations to intensify fighting were still continuing, and the release of Mr Alexander had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas.
A senior Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations with the US in Qatar told the BBC that Hamas's announcement was intended as a goodwill gesture before Trump's arrival.
He said another meeting between Hamas and the mediators was scheduled for early Monday morning to finalise the process of Mr Alexander's release, which would require a temporary halt to Israeli military activity and a suspension of aerial operations during the handover.
President Trump confirmed Alexander's release in a post on Truth Social, calling it ""monumental news"" and ""a step taken in good faith"". 
Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, 21-year-old Alexander was serving in an elite infantry unit on the border with Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October attack.
Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's 2023 attack, 58 remain in the enclave, as  well as another hostage who was taken at an earlier date. Up to 24 of them are believed to be alive. 
Five of those in Gaza are believed to be US citizens and Alexander was thought to be the only one still alive.
Mr Alexander's family said they had ""received the greatest gift imaginable - news that our beautiful son Edan is returning home after 583 days in captivity in Gaza"".
They added: ""We express our deepest gratitude to President Trump, Steve Witkoff, and the US administration for their tireless work to make this happen.
""We urge the Israeli government and the negotiating teams: please don't stop. We hope our son's release begins negotiations for all 58 remaining hostages, ending this nightmare for them and their families. No hostage should be left behind.""
A picture of Edan Alexander can be seen at a demonstration in Israel calling for the release of the remaining hostages
Egypt and Qatar also released a joint statement saying that Hamas agreeing to free Alexander was an ""encouraging step toward a return to the negotiating table"".  
In its statement, Hamas said the release was part of efforts to achieve a ceasefire and allow food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza - which has been under a complete blockade by Israel for 70 days. The group said it wanted to reach a final agreement to end the war.
The Israeli prime minister's office said in an earlier statement that it had been informed by the US of the Hamas intention to release Alexander ""as a gesture towards the Americans"" and that the move was expected to lead to negotiations on further hostages.
Israel's policy was that negotiations would be conducted ""under fire, based on the commitment to achieve all of the objectives of the war"", it added.
Hamas has in the past said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war, something that has been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
The talks between Hamas and the US are taking place amid multiple reports suggesting growing frustration in the Trump administration with Netanyahu's position. The prime minister is also under pressure at home, with many accusing him of prolonging the war for political purposes.
President Donald Trump arrives in the Middle East on Tuesday, and Israel has vowed to expand its military offensive against Hamas if no deal is reached by the end of his visit.
Israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of the territory indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the UN and its humanitarian partners, who say they will not co-operate because it appears to ""weaponise"" aid.
Gaza has been under a full Israeli blockade for 70 days
Israel has already blocked the entry of all food, medication and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza for 70 days, which aid agencies say amounts to a policy of starvation and could be a war crime, and renewed its aerial bombardment and other military operations there in mid-March, which have since killed 2,720 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Since the beginning of the year, according to the UN, about 10,000 cases of acute malnutrition among children have been identified. Food prices have rocketed by as much as 1,400%.
The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.
Israel's military campaign has killed 52,829 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

In a post on X,, external Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland knows ""for sure"" that the blaze at the Marywilska shopping centre was caused by arson ordered by the Russian special services.
Some of those responsible are already in custody, Tusk added, while all the others alleged to have been involved have been identified and are being searched for. 
Moscow has not commented on the allegations, but has previously denied accusations of sabotage in Europe.
The fire in May 2024 destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there being members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community. 
Poland carried out a year-long investigation into the incident, which has now concluded the fire was organised by an unnamed person in Russia. 
A joint statement by Poland's justice and interior ministers said the actions of those in custody were ""organised and directed by a specific person residing in the Russian Federation."" 
The two ministries added that they were co-operating with Lithuania ""where some of the perpetrators also carried out acts of diversion"".
Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Poland has detained and convicted several people accused of sabotage on behalf of Russian intelligence services. 
Polish officials have said that these attacks have been part of a ""hybrid war"" waged by Moscow. 
Hybrid warfare is when a hostile state carries out an anonymous, deniable attack, usually in highly suspicious circumstances. It will be enough to harm their opponent, especially their infrastructure assets, but stop short of being an attributable act of war.
Nato also believes Russia is waging ""hybrid warfare"" in Europe, with the aim of punishing or deterring Western nations from continuing their military support for Ukraine.
Russia has denied repeated allegations by Nato countries that its secret services are engaged in sabotage operations across Europe.
Back in March, Lithuanian prosecutors accused Russia's military intelligence service of being behind an arson attack on a branch of Ikea in the capital Vilnius last year.
At the time, Tusk said Lithuania had confirmed Warsaw's ""suspicions that [those] responsible for setting fires to shopping centres in Vilnius and Warsaw are the Russian secret services.""
Two Ukrainian suspects were arrested.  
The Marywilska shopping centre opened in 2010 and in the fire many workers lost important documents and large sums of cash which were kept at the shopping centre due to fear of breaks ins at home.
Three months after the fire, a temporary shopping centre was opened by Marywilska's owners, where approximately 400 traders resumed operations. 
An alternative shopping centre in Warsaw, Modlinska 6D, was opened  in October 2024 with traders relocating their businesses to the new site."

With US President Donald Trump due to visit Gulf states this week, a key focus will be securing significant new investment for the US economy.
""President Trump wants the announcement [of more Gulf money for the US],"" says economist Karen Young, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank.
""He wants to have a big poster in a meeting that describes where these investments might go. And some estimation of what they will do to the American economy in terms of job creation or his big push, of course, on domestic manufacturing.""
Trump is due to arrive in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday 13 May, to meet the country's de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Trump is then expected to attend a summit of Gulf leaders in the city on 14 May, before travelling to Qatar that same day, and then ending his three-day trip in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 15 May.
The economic importance of the region to Trump is highlighted by the fact that the visit to Saudi Arabia was due to be the first overseas trip of his second term in the White House. That was before the death of Pope Francis necessitated Trump attending his funeral in Rome towards the end of April.
Saudi Arabia was also the first country that Trump visited during his first term of office, going against the modern practise of US presidents to start with the UK, Canada or Mexico.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund owns an 8.4% stake in Uber
Securing new investments in the US from Gulf states, and particularly from their state-backed sovereign wealth funds, will help Trump to signal back home that his ""America First"" agenda is delivering results.
The presidential visit is drawing top Wall Street and Silicon Valley leaders to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-US investment forum on 13 May in Riyadh will feature CEOs from BlackRock, Palantir, Citigroup, IBM, Qualcomm, Alphabet, and Franklin Templeton.
The push comes amid economic headwinds, as President Trump's new import tariffs have significantly disrupted global trade, confidence, and the US economy itself. US economic output fell in the first three months of this year, its first fall in three years.
Back in January, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn (Â£450bn) in the US over the next four years. However, Trump has already said that he'd like that to rise to $1tn,, external including purchases of more US military equipment.
According to Ali Shihabi â a Saudi commentator and author, with close ties to the Saudi government â a number of economic agreements will be signed during the trip.
""These deals will further integrate the Saudi and US economies together, joint ventures in the kingdom, in the United States, procurements of American weapons and goods,"" says Mr Shihabi.
Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment fund (PIF), which controls assets worth $925bn, already has numerous investments in the US. These include Uber, gaming firm Electronic Arts, and electric car firm Lucid.
Meanwhile, the UAE has already committed to investing $1.4tn in the US over the next 10 years, in sectors such as AI, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. This was announced by the White House in March after the UAE's national security advisor, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, met President Trump in Washington.
Yet Ms Young from the Middle East Institute says that the scale of these investments is not realistic in the short term. She instead says that they are long-term strategic moves, and that the figures should be taken ""with a little bit of a grain of salt"".
Regarding specific deals that could be announced during Trump's visit, it is widely reported that Saudi Arabia will agree to buy more than $100bn of US arms and other military items.
These are said to include missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft.
The US has been a longstanding arms supplier to Saudi Arabia, but in 2021 the then Biden administration stopped selling Riyadh offensive weapons, citing concerns about the country's role in the war in neighbouring Yemen.
The 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was also widely reported to be a factor. A US report said that Prince Mohammed had approved the murder.
The Biden White House resumed the sale of these weapons last year. While it cited that the Saudis had stopped bombing Yemen, some commentators said that the US was seeking Saudi assistance to help end the conflict in Gaza and aid its future reconstruction.
Saudi Arabia is investing in construction and infrastructure as it tries to move its economy away from oil
Mr Shihabi says Saudi Arabia will be seeking assurances from the White House that the US will implement a ""more efficient procurement system"", enabling the Gulf state to access ammunition and military equipment far more quickly and easily.
""The Trump administration is initiating procedures to facilitate those deals. So, it's expected that this process will improve immediately,"" he adds.
Artificial intelligence is the other topic that will dominate the agenda during Mr Trump's visit. Talks are expected to centre on attracting greater Gulf investment into US tech firms, and boosting the region's access to cutting-edge American semiconductors.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia have been investing billions of dollars into tech and AI sectors as they try to diversify their economies away from oil.
The Emiratis, in particular, are keen to establish themselves as a global AI hub.
Last week, the Trump administration scrapped the Biden-era chip regulations that placed restrictions on exports of advanced US chips to more than 120 countries including the Gulf states.
The White House is expected to draft new rules that would potentially involve direct negotiations with countries like the UAE.
""For the UAE, this is absolutely essential,"" says Ms Young. ""They are aggressively building out their AI capacity. So, for them getting access to US technology is imperative to be the best.""
While much attention will be on Trump courting Gulf capital for the US, Saudi Arabia is equally focused on drawing American investment into its ambitious Vision 2030 program.
Led by giant construction projects, such as the building of a linear city called The Line, Vision 2030 is central to the Saudi government's continuing efforts to diversify the country's economy away from oil.
It also involves pouring resources into entertainment, tourism, mining and sports.
However, foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia declined for a third straight year in 2024, reflecting persistent challenges in attracting overseas capital.
The fall in global oil prices since the start of the year has further strained Riyadh's finances, increasing pressure to either raise debt or cut spending to sustain its development goals.
Oil prices tumbled to a four-year low amid growing concerns that a trade war could dampen global economic growth.
The decline was further fuelled by the group of oil producing nations, Opec+, announcing plans to increase output.
Saudi Arabia is part of that group, and some commentators said that the rise was in part a desire to please Trump,, external who has called for lower oil prices.
Other analysts said the reason was more that Opec+ remains confident that the global economy is growing.
The US-Saudi Business Council, is an organisation that aims to boost trade ties between the two countries.
It is hoping that Trump's visit will push American businesses to explore more opportunities in Saudi Arabia, especially in sectors like AI, healthcare and education.
""The Saudi government is looking heavily to invest in these sectors. There is a very big appetite for Saudi companies to collaborate with American companies,"" Hutham Al Jalal, who heads the Riyadh office for the organisation, tells the BBC.
Saudi officials are said to be confident that some deals in these sectors will be secured during Trump's visit.
For Saudi Arabia, Trump's visit is about strengthening ties with their longest-standing Western ally - a relationship that grew strained during the Biden years. For President Trump, it is about landing investment deals that can be framed as a win for his economic agenda.
""President Trump is looking for a headline of big investments in America, and he will get that from this trip,"" adds Mr Shihabi."
505,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce80d4yppl3o,2025-05-11 23:05:46,"The rare disease in a remote town where 'almost everyone is a cousin',","Affected families in Serrinha dos Pintos lived without a diagnosis until geneticist Silvana Santos arrived 
Before Silvana Santos arrived in the little town of Serrinha dos Pintos more than 20 years ago, residents had no idea why so many local children had lost the ability to walk.
The remote town in north-eastern Brazil is home to fewer than 5,000 people, and is where biologist and geneticist Santos identified and named a previously unknown condition: Spoan syndrome.
Caused by a genetic mutation, the syndrome affects the nervous system, gradually weakening the body. It only appears when the altered gene is inherited from both parents.
Santos's research marked the first time the disease had been described anywhere in the world. For this and later work, she was named one of the BBC's 100 most influential women in 2024.
Before Santos arrived, families had no explanation for the illness affecting their children. Today, residents talk confidently about Spoan and genetics.
""She gave us a diagnosis we never had. After the research, help came: people, funding, wheelchairs,"" says Marquinhos, one of the patients.
Where Santos is from in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, many of her neighbours were members of the same extended family originally from Serrinha. Many of them were cousins of varying degrees, married to each other.
They told Santos that many of people in their hometown couldn't walk, but that no-one knew why.
One of the neighbours' daughters, ZirlÃ¢ndia, suffered from a debilitating condition: as a child, her eyes moved involuntarily and over time, she lost strength in her limbs and needed to use a wheelchair, requiring help with even the simplest tasks.
Years of investigation would lead Santos and a research team to identify these as symptoms of Spoan syndrome.
They would go on to find 82 other cases worldwide.
The entrance of Serrinha dos Pintos, where research suggests nearly a third of couples are related
At the invitation of her neighbours, Santos visited Serrinha on holiday. She describes her arrival as stepping into ""a world of its own"" - not just because of the lush scenery and mountain views, but also due to what seemed to be a notable social coincidence.
The more she walked and spoke with locals, the more surprised she was at how common marriages between cousins were.
Serrinha's geographical isolation and little inward migration mean that many of the population are related, making marriage between cousins far more likely and more socially acceptable.
Worldwide, marriages between relatives were estimated at around 10% in the early 2010s. More recent data shows the rate varies widely, from over 50% in countries like Pakistan, to 1-4% in Brazil and less than 1% in the US and Russia. Most children born to pairs of cousins are healthy, experts say.
But these marriages do face a higher risk of a harmful genetic mutation being passed down through the family.
""If a couple is unrelated, the chance of having a child with a rare genetic disorder or disability is about 2â3%. For cousins, the risk rises to 5â6% per pregnancy,"" explains geneticist Luzivan Costa Reis from Brazil's Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul.
A 2010 study led by Santos showed that more than 30% of couples in Serrinha were related, and a third of them had at least one child with a disability.
Santos set out to find a diagnosis for the people of Serrinha and she began planning a detailed genetic study, requiring multiple trips and eventually leading to her relocating to the region.
She drove the 1,250 miles (2,000km) to and from SÃ£o Paulo many times in the early years of her research. She collected DNA samples door-to-door, chatting to locals over coffee and gathering family stories, all the while trying to locate the mutation causing the disease.
What was supposed to be three months of fieldwork turned into years of dedication.
It all led to the publication in 2005 of the team's study revealing the existence of Spoan in the Brazilian hinterland.
Santos's team found that the mutation involves the loss of a small fragment of a chromosome, which causes a gene to overproduce a key protein in brain cells.
""They said it came from Maximiano, a womaniser in our family,"" recalls farmer LolÃ´, whose daughter Rejane has Spoan.
LolÃ´, now 83, married his cousin and never left Serrinha. He still tends cattle and relies on family to care for Rejane, who struggles with daily tasks.
But the genetic mutation behind Spoan is far older than the legend of Old Maximiano: it likely arrived more than 500 years ago with early European settlers in the north-east of Brazil.
""Sequencing studies show strong European ancestry in patients, supporting records of Portuguese, Dutch, and Sephardic Jewish presence in the region,"" says Santos.
The theory gained strength after two Spoan cases were found in Egypt, and further studies showed that the Egyptian cases also shared European ancestry, pointing to a common origin in the Iberian Peninsula.
""It likely came with related Sephardic Jews or Moors fleeing the Inquisition,"" says Santos. She believes more cases may exist globally, especially in Portugal.
Silvana Santos no longer lives in the area, but she continues to visit
Although there's been little progress toward a cure, tracking patients has brought some change. Rejane recalls how people used to be called ""cripples"". Now, they're simply said to have Spoan.
Wheelchairs brought not just independence, but also helped prevent deformities - in the past, many with the condition had been left simply lying in bed or on the floor.
As Spoan progresses, physical limitations worsen with age and by 50, nearly all patients become fully dependent on carers.
This is the case for InÃ©s's children, who are among the oldest in Serrinha. Chiquinho, 59, can no longer speak, and Marquinhos, 46, has limited communication abilities.
""It's hard to have a 'special' child. We love them the same, but we suffer for them,"" says InÃ©s, who is married to a second cousin.
InÃªs has two sons affected by Spoan Syndrome
Larissa Queiroz, 25, the niece of Chiquinho and Marquinho, also married a distant relative. She and her husband, Saulo, only discovered their common ancestor after several months of dating.
""In Serrinha dos Pintos, deep down, we're all cousins. We're related to everyone,"" she says.
Couples like Larissa and Saulo are the focus of a new research project which Santos is also involved in. Backed by Brazil's Ministry of Health, it will screen 5,000 couples for genes linked to serious recessive diseases.
Thanks to research in occupational therapy, Paula and several other patients have already received motorised wheelchairs
The goal is not to stop cousin marriages, but to help couples understand their genetic risks, says Santos. Now a university professor, she also leads a genetics education centre and works to expand testing in the north-east of Brazil.
Though she no longer lives in Serrinha dos Pintos, every visit feels like coming home.
""It's as if Santos is family,"" says InÃ©s."
506,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1egely9v3go,2025-05-11 23:05:24,"Why Burkina Faso's junta leader has captured hearts and minds around the world,","A charismatic 37-year-old, Burkina Faso's military ruler Capt Ibrahim TraorÃ© has skilfully built the persona of a pan-Africanist leader determined to free his nation from what he regards as the clutches of Western imperialism and neo-colonialism.
His message has resonated across Africa and beyond, with his admirers seeing him as following in the footsteps of African heroes like Burkina Faso's very own Thomas Sankara - a Marxist revolutionary who is sometimes referred to as ""Africa's Che Guevara"". 
""TraorÃ©'s impact is huge. I have even heard politicians and authors in countries like Kenya [in East Africa] say: 'This is it. He is the man',"" Beverly Ochieng, a senior researcher at global consultancy firm Control Risks, told the BBC. 
""His messages reflect the age we are living in, when many Africans are questioning the relationship with the West, and why there is still so much poverty in such a resource-rich continent,"" she said.
After seizing power in a coup in 2022, TraorÃ©'s regime ditched former colonial power France in favour of a strong alliance with Russia, that has included the deployment of a Russian paramilitary brigade, and adopted left-wing economic policies.
This included setting up a state-owned mining company, requiring foreign firms to give it a 15% stake in their local operations and to transfer skills to BurkinabÃ© people.
The rule also applied to Russian miner Nordgold, external, which was given a licence in late April for its latest investment in Burkina Faso's gold industry. 
As part of what TraorÃ© calls a ""revolution"" to ensure Burkina Faso benefits from its mineral wealth, the junta is also building a gold refinery and establishing national gold reserves for the first time in the nation's history.
However, Western-owned firms appear to be facing a tough time, with Australia-headquartered Sarama Resources launching arbitration proceedings against Burkina Faso in late 2024 following the withdrawal of an exploration licence, external.
The junta has also nationalised two gold mines previously owned by a London-listed firm, and said last month that it planned to take control of more foreign-owned mines.
Enoch Randy Aikins, a researcher at South Africa's Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC that TraorÃ©'s radical reforms had increased his popularity in Africa. 
""He is now arguably Africa's most popular, if not favourite, president,"" Mr Aikins said.
Support for Western-style democracy has fallen in many African states, research shows
His popularity has been fuelled through social media, including many misleading posts intended to bolster his revolutionary image.
AI-generated videos of music stars like R Kelly, Rihanna,, external Justin Bieber and BeyoncÃ© are seen immortalising him through song - though they have done nothing of the sort. 
Ms Ochieng said that TraorÃ© first caught the attention of Africans when he spoke at the Russia-Africa summit in 2023, telling African leaders to ""stop behaving like puppets who dance every time the imperialists pull the strings"". 
This speech was heavily publicised by Russian media, which has become a major player in promoting TraorÃ©'s pan-Africanist image.
TraorÃ© attended commemorations in Russia last week to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. He posted on X that he, along with military leaders from neighbouring Mali and Niger, were inspired by it ""to winning the war against terrorism and imperialism at all costs"".
Thanks to his rhetoric and pushed by a slick social media campaign, his appeal has spread around the world, including among African-Americans and Black Britons, Ms Ochieng noted.
""Everyone who has experienced racism, colonialism and slavery can relate to his messages,"" Ms Ochieng said, pointing out that African-American rapper Meek Mill had posted about him on X late last year, saying how much he liked his ""energy and heart"" - though he was ridiculed for mixing up names by referring to TraorÃ© as Burkina Faso and later deleted the post.
But France's president is not a fan, describing TraorÃ© as part of a ""baroque alliance between self-proclaimed pan-Africans and neo-imperialists"".
Emmanuel Macron was also referring to Russia and China whom he accused, in a 2023 speech, of provoking coups in Africa's former French colonies, and hypocritically stirring up old arguments over sovereignty and colonial exploitation.
TraorÃ©'s popularity comes despite the fact that he has failed to fulfil his pledge to quell a 10-year Islamist insurgency that has fuelled ethnic divisions and has now spread to once-peaceful neighbours like Benin.
His junta has also cracked down on dissent, including the opposition, media and civil society groups and punished critics, among them medics and magistrates, by sending them to the front-lines of the war against the jihadists.
Thomas Sankara, who was killed in 1987, was praised by supporters for his integrity and selflessness - and remains an icon for many in Africa
For Rinaldo Depagne, the Africa deputy director of the International Crisis Group think-tank, TraorÃ© commands such support because ""he is young in a country with a young population"" - the median age is 17.7 years, external.
""He is media-savvy, and uses the past to build his popularity as a reincarnation of Sankara,"" he told the BBC.
""And he knows the art of politics - how to make a nation completely traumatised by war feel there is a better future. He is really good at that game.""
Sankara rose to power in a coup in 1983 at the age of 33, rallied the nation under the motto ""Fatherland or death, we will win!"", and was killed four years later in another coup that put Burkina Faso back in France's political orbit until TraorÃ©'s seizure of power.
Ghanaian security analyst Prof Kwesi Aning, who previously worked at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, said the popularity of the military leader reflected a political shift taking place on the continent, especially in West Africa.
A 2024 survey in 39 countries by Afrobarometer showed a drop in support for democracy, external, although it remained the most popular form of government.
""Democracy has failed to give hope to the youth. It has not delivered jobs or better education and health,"" Prof Aning told the BBC.
He said TraorÃ© was ""offering an alternative, and re-capturing the spirit of two historic epochs"":
The post-independence era, when there were leaders like Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia
And a later era with Sankara and Ghana's Jerry Rawlings, whose coup in 1979 ""was also very popular at the time"". 
Capt TraorÃ© is at ease chatting to people - here with agricultural workers in March
It was TraorÃ© who stole the show at the inauguration of Ghana's President John Mahama in January, when he arrived wearing battle fatigues with a pistol in his holster.
""There were already 21 heads of state there, but when TraorÃ© walked in, the place lit up. Even my president's bodyguards were running after him,"" Prof Aning said. 
TraorÃ© offered a sharply contrasting image to some of the continent's other leaders, who struggled to walk but clung to power by rigging elections, he said.
""TraorÃ© is stylish and confident, with a very open face and a small smile. He is also a powerful orator, and presents himself as a man of the people.""
In a sign that his Russian-allied junta has made some progress on the economic front, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank have given a generally upbeat assessment.
In a statement in early April, external, the IMF said that despite a ""challenging humanitarian and security"" environment, the economy was expected to remain ""robust"" in 2025, and the regime had made ""commendable progress"" in raising domestic revenue, containing the public wage bill, and increasing spending on education, health and social protection.
As for the World Bank, it said that inflation had surged, external from 0.7% in 2023 to 4.2% in 2024, but the extreme poverty rate, which refers to people living on less than $2.15 [Â£1.61] a day, had fallen by almost two percentage points to 24.9% because of ""robust growth"" in the agriculture and services sectors. 
Despite these reports from US-based financial institutions, relations with both France and America have been frosty.
A recent example being the claim by the head of the US Africa Command, Gen Michael Langley, that TraorÃ© was using Burkina Faso's gold reserves for his junta's protection rather than the nation's benefit, external.
This appeared to be a reference to the long-standing view of the US, and some of its African allies, that Russian forces were propping up TraorÃ© in exchange for a stake in Burkina Faso's gold industry - undermining the military ruler's image as a leader who expelled French troops in 2023 to reclaim the country's sovereignty. 
Gen Langley's comments, made in early April during a US Senate committee hearing, triggered an uproar among the captain's supporters, who felt their hero was being smeared.
This was further inflamed when shortly afterwards, the BurkinabÃ© junta said it had foiled a coup plot, alleging the plotters were based in neighbouring Ivory Coast - where Gen Langley then made a visit.
A huge rally in support of Capt TraorÃ© was held in Ouagadougou on 30 April - along with others in cities around the world, including London
Ivory Coast denied being involved in any plot, while the US Africa Command said Gen Langley's visit had focused on addressing ""common security challenges, external"" - including ""violent extremism"".
But the junta took the opportunity to organise one of its biggest rallies in Burkina Faso's capital over fears that ""imperialists"" and their ""lackeys"" were trying to depose the captain.
""Because Colin Powell lied, Iraq was destroyed. Barack Obama lied, Gaddafi was killed. But this time, their lies won't affect us,"" one protester, musician Ocibi Johann, told the Associated Press news agency. 
Rallies in solidarity with TraorÃ© were also held abroad, including in London, on the same day.
He took to social media afterwards, posting in French and English, external, to express his gratitude to them for sharing his vision ""for a new Burkina Faso and a new Africa"", adding: ""Together, in solidarity, we will defeat imperialism and neo-colonialism for a free, dignified and sovereign Africa.""
It is impossible to say how things will end for the young captain, but he - along with military leaders in Mali and Niger - have certainly shaken up West Africa, and other states have followed their example by ordering French forces to leave.
The three military-ruled neighbours have also pulled out of the regional trade and security grouping Ecowas, formed their own alliance, and have ended free trade in the region by announcing the imposition of a 0.5% tariff on goods coming into their countries.
Mr Aikins said TraorÃ© could learn from others, pointing out that when Rawlings took power in Ghana at the age of 32, he was known as ""Junior Jesus"" but after 19 years he left a mixed legacy - he had been unable to stem corruption despite helping to create an ""enduring"" democracy.
For a ""lasting legacy"", Mr Aikins said, TraorÃ© should focus on achieving peace and  building strong state institutions to bring about good governance rather than ""personalising"" power and cracking down on dissent.

Dust was rising on the track. It hung in the hot midday air as the white jeep came towards us. The driver was less than a minute away.
""I think it's Moshe Sharvit,"" said Gil Alexander, 72, a devout religious Jew who tries to protect Palestinian shepherds from intimidation by Jewish settlers. 
Over the last year we've been documenting his work with shepherds in the northern Jordan Valley, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The man approaching us was placed under sanctions by Britain and the EU last year after they said he had used  ""physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities"".
In a case reported by our colleagues at BBC Eye Investigates last year, a Palestinian grandmother alleged that Moshe Sharvit had forced her to leave her family home in October 2023. Ayesha Shtayyeh also said he pointed a gun at her head and threatened to kill her.
Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank, together
Extremist settlers rapidly seizing West Bank land
""We've been here for 50 yearsâ¦What have I ever done to him?"" she asked when BBC Eye interviewed her. 
She said her family's troubles began after Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'- a settlement that is illegal under both Israeli and international law - chasing away the family's sheep, damaging property and constantly threatening them. The alleged incident with the gun was the final straw.
Moshe Sharvit did not respond to BBC Eye's requests for a response to Ayesha's account.
Back on the mountainside, the man accused of this violence stopped his car and approached us. Nodding towards Gil Alexander he asked us: ""Do you know he's a very dangerous guy?"" 
When our translator explained to Moshe Sharvit we were from the BBC he said: ""Ah the BBCâ¦ great lovers of Israelâ¦"" He went on to call us bad and dangerous people.
Addressing our translator he said: ""So, do you understand that they're the people who are most dangerous to the State of Israel?"" 
Then he phoned the police, asking them to come to the scene. When he wasn't calling the police he filmed us filming him.
Moshe Sharvit and Gil Alexander represent starkly different visions of Israel's future. 
Moshe Sharvit believes all of the West Bank - which settlers and the Israeli government call Judea and Samaria - were given by God to the Jews. 
In this he is supported by senior ministers in the government, including the Minister of Finance, Bezalel Smotrich, and the Minister of Public Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Both men are settlers and leaders of far-right ultranationalist parties.
Ayesha Shtayyeh alleges Moshe Sharvit threatened her with a gun and told her to leave her home of 50 years 
Smotrich has said Gaza will be ""totally destroyed"" and that its people will be ""totally despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places"".
The 'other places' he envisages are foreign countries. Ben-Gvir, who is responsible for the police, has convictions for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.
Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, relies on the support of the far-right settler movement to keep his government in power. 
He criticised the sanctions imposed on Moshe Sharvit and other settlers, saying his government viewed the move ""with great severity"". US sanctions against Moshe Sharvit were dropped when President Donald Trump came to power.
The UN's top court ruled last year that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is against international law and that all settlement activity is illegal. 
Israel rejects this and argues that settlements are necessary for security, citing lethal attacks by Palestinian gunmen on settlers, such as the killing of three people last January in the West Bank.
Gil Alexander (left) and Moshe Sharvit both phoned the police
Settlement expansion is anathema to Gil Alexander. He considers himself a Zionist, but within the existing borders of Israel. 
These are the frontiers that existed before it seized the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. 
He is part of a network called the Jordan Valley Activists â Moshe Sharvit calls them ""anarchists"" - offering solidarity, and working for peaceful co-existence with the Palestinians.
""What they [the settlers] want to see happen,"" Gil Alexander told us, ""[is] that it will be an area completely free of Arabs. It isn't Moshe. It's all the people above him who sent him here. Meaning from the top"". 
Moshe Sharvit's desire to have the Jordan Valley empty of Palestinians is shared by the leader of the regional council, a government-supported body, David Elhayani, who has visited the sanctioned settler.
In his air conditioned office about 15km (9 miles) from Moshe Sharvit's settler outpost he told us ""the notion of settler violence is an invention of the anarchist, extreme left meant to harm the settlement image"". 
As for the future of the Palestinians, he was emphatic. They should go to neighbouring Jordan. 
""This country needs to be free of Arabs. It's the only way. It's a global interest. Why global? Because the minute there won't be Arabs here it will be a Jewish nation for the Jews who won't have to hurt each other, there won't be conflict, there won't be anything.""
Gil Alexander, who describes himself as a Zionist, believes Israeli territory should end at the 1967 borders
Gil Alexander and Moshe Sharvit have a history of antagonism. During an altercation on a Palestinian farmer's land in January 2023, Moshe Sharvit says Gil Alexander tried to seize his firearm from its holster. 
While speaking to our translator he produced a video of the incident on his phone.
""You can see Gil Alexander. Same hat and glasses. That's me. Here you see he grabs my gun.""
Gil Alexander says he was acting in self-defence after Moshe Sharvit had grabbed his walking stick, and the phone of a woman friend who he alleges was pushed violently to the ground. 
He says he feared Moshe Sharvit was going to use the weapon. As a result, Moshe Sharvit got a restraining order which forbids Gil Alexander from being within 2.5km (1.5 miles) of his farm. 
The police have charged Gil Alexander with illegal possession of a weapon (the one he allegedly tried to take from Moshe Sharvit) and assault. The issue will be considered by the Israeli courts.
Moshe Sharvit himself is the subject of a restraining order forbidding him to approach a Palestinian family living near his outpost for six months, since March this year. 
During our encounter the settler claimed that Gil Alexander had breached his restraining order by taking us to the high ground overlooking the valley. The peace activist told us later that he had mistakenly strayed just over half a kilometre inside the area of the order.
Although Moshe Sharvit's settlement is illegal, even under Israeli law, it has not been removed.
Human rights organisations and numerous eyewitnesses testify that the Israeli army and police frequently stand by while settlers attack Palestinian villages. 
The violence has escalated sharply since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 kidnapped, and which triggered the Gaza war.
Moshe Sharvit approached, blocked the road and phoned the police
According to a report issued by the UN office for Humanitarian Affairs there were 1,804 attacks by settlers against Palestinians in the period January 2024 to March 2025.
The Israeli human rights group, Yesh Din (There is Law), reported that only 3% of complaints made against settlers resulted in a conviction. In six days last month - from 22 to 28 April - the UN recorded 14 incidents involving settlers that left 36 Palestinians injured.
In the tense atmosphere on the mountainside, and wanting to avoid any escalation, we decided to leave. 
As we walked away, Moshe Sharvit went to his jeep and drove ahead of us, stopping where the track turned down the mountain. Our way out was blocked. There was no-one we could appeal to apart from the man preventing us from leaving.
Again, he phoned the police asking them to come. Gil Alexander phoned the police and his lawyer. Our team was worried that more settlers would come.
Then something surprising happened. I suggested to Moshe Sharvit that he should agree to be interviewed. After a brief pause, he said: ""Bring the camera.""
What followed was less an interview, than a series of declarations. He was doing the work of God, he said.
Why did local Bedouin shepherds say they were very afraid of him? I asked. 
""No, that is a lie. They're telling stories so the world will think we're crazy. It's not true. It's all lies that are built on lies of dozens of years of lyingâ¦"" he said.
""The Arabs, since the formation of the country and before - all the past 77 years they've been preoccupied with harming the people of Israel, harming the land of Israel and causing the nation of Israel to be miserable and pitiful. But they don't understand that the harder they try, the Lion will wake from his sleep and within one day we'll end this story.""
He repeated the analogy of the Lion later in the interview saying, in what sounded like ominous words, that the Palestinians were ""pushing the lion so hard into the corner that there will be no choice left but to finish this story"". 
""7 October was small. One day it'll be big.""
As for peaceful co-existence such as Gil Alexander supports, he said there was ""no such thing as peace with enemies who try to destroy you"". 
Moshe Sharvit's brother Harel was killed fighting in Gaza in December 2023.
His world is the pastureland, the stony hills of the Jordan Valley, his sheep and cattle, the bed and breakfast he has opened. 
He produced a glossy video, replete with a backing track of American country music, to promote his venture.
He spoke with contempt for the British sanctions against him. They were a new kind of antisemitism, he claimed. 
""The minute someone tries to hurt me I get stronger. My spiritâ¦I receive energies, my spirit continues on its mission, I continue advancing forward and planting roots deep into the land of Israel. I'm not bothered by Britain or America or anyone.""
Moshe Sharvit agreed to be interviewed 
Then he drove away. We were free to move on. Later as we were having lunch in a cafÃ© about 15km (nine miles) away, a policeman appeared, looking for Gil Alexander. 
He went with the police officer for questioning. After about an hour he returned, telling us he had been ordered not to enter the Jordan Valley for two weeks. He plans to lodge his own complaint against Moshe Sharvit over the incident.
We went to Gil Alexander's home in a kibbutz inside Israel that overlooks the Valley. Gunmen from the Palestinian city of Jenin fired at the kibbutz two years ago. 
Gil Alexander is not a pacifist. If he is attacked by Hamas or any other group, he will defend himself.
He said: ""A son of our friends, two months ago he was killed here by a terrorist. He was a soldier in the reserves, 46 years old with six children. He volunteered for the reserves to protect me.""
""If the army hadn't been there, they would have come here. He was killed while defending me. And today he is buried next to my two sons.""
But Gil Alexander seemed weary as we sat drinking tea amid the bright red flowers of his well-tended garden, and the fluttering yellow flags that symbolise Israel's hostages held in Gaza. 
He spoke of a beloved nephew killed fighting in Lebanon in an earlier war.
Did he not, I wondered, at the age of 72, think about retiring from the struggle and enjoying his garden? He laughed. 
There was no chance of that. After two of his sons took their own lives â one was in the army, the other was about to enter the military â he had found a purpose in working for what he calls the ""humanitarian"" ideals of Judaism.
""After the tragedies of my sons, if I don't find meaning in life, I'll go crazyâ¦ And the things I do, are things I believe in. And these are things I also got from my father who was in the French underground during World War Two and fought for French liberation but was against any type of occupation and said, 'Occupation is Occupation.'""
Two days after our encounter with Moshe Sharvit, a lone woman peace activist filmed him banging on the window of her car and rocking the vehicle. 
The woman is clearly frightened by the intimidation. Moshe Sharvit acts as if he has nothing to fear.
With additional reporting by Oren Rosenfeld and Nik Millard."

""That is going to be something that will be very important going forward to support the children in the school and the parents."" 
The tragedy unfolded on Saturday afternoon after the Irish Coast Guard received a report that there were a number of people in difficulty in the water. 
Later that evening, an 18-year-old male's body was recovered from the water.
A juvenile who was rescued from the water was taken to Letterkenny University Hospital, where he died in the early hours of Sunday morning.
A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore.
The Irish Coast Guard thanked all the search and rescue units and members of the public who assisted
Evelyn McLoughlin principal of Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana, where Emmanuel attended, said there were ""no words"" that could ""fully capture the pain and sorrow that we are feeling"".
""We are truly heartbroken,"" she said.
Paying tribute Ms McLoughlin added: ""Emmanuel embodied the true ethos of Scoil Mhuire, he was known for his warm personality, gentle humour and thoughtful nature. 
""He immersed himself fully in our school community and was highly regarded by staff and students alike.""
She added that the school will provide support for Emmanuel's brother, who is a student there, ""through his unthinkable loss"".
The principals of Scoil Mhuire and Crana College delivered a joint statement to the media
Kevin Cooley, principal of Crana College, where Matt attended, added: ""As beautiful as today is, there is a dark cloud of sadness over Buncrana.
""Matt joined Crana College in January 2024, he was welcomed with open arms,"" he said.
""He was preparing for his leaving cert at the start of June. He was a determined young man, he was the most respectful young man you could ever meet.
""We share our thoughts and prayers to the families.""
Mr Cooley also thanked the emergency service for their efforts.
Speaking to BBC News NI, local priest Fr Francis Bradley said: ""You can only imagine they [the families] are absolutely devastated.
""It's difficult to witness, but powerful to witness a mother's love, her feeling of total abandonment.
""Last night, a mother sitting cradling her son, I've looked at the PietÃ , but to see it brought alive in that way is very moving.
""To hear her call out his name, even though there was no hope, to know all I could do was stand in silence in the hope that there was a good shepherd calling his name.
""Here we do not view them as immigrants or asylum seekers, to us they are parishioners.""
Joe Joyce said one of the teenagers managed to make it back ashore
Joe Joyce from Lough Swilly RNLI said when they got the call they immediately launched two lifeboats.
""One of the teenagers managed to make it back ashore,"" he told BBC News NI.
A former RNLI crew member, who was on the lough in his own personal boat, assisted the incident.
""He came on scene and and pulled another 16 year old out of the water.
""Around nine, half nine, we were starting to scale down the search as we lost the daylight and the Coast Guard had their drone team up.
""An object was detected in the water. That object turned out to be a person, an 18-year-old teenager. 
""He was recovered by the Coast Guard to the pier in Buncrana, where a doctor on scene pronounced him dead.""
The incident happened near Ned's Point, just outside Buncrana, at about 16:00 local time
The mayor of Inishowen, Sinn FÃ©in's Jack Murray, told BBC News NI the community is ""devastated.""
""On what was such a happy day, Donegal won the Ulster Championship, the Sun was shining and then that filtered through, the worst news possible that these two young men have lost their lives, it is horrendous,"" he said.
Paying tribute to the two teenagers, Murray said they were ""of different nationalities from Africa, who were talented young boys"". 
""It is just so sad that their lives could be cut short so tragically,"" he said.
""This is a community that has been visited by tragedy far too often,"" he added.
""I would like to think and hope that their families know that we are all thinking of them.""
An Irish Coast Guard helicopter was involved in the search off Buncrana beach on Saturday
100% Redress councillor Joy Beard said people in the area are in ""shock.""
""We are absolutely heartbroken,"" she said.
Beard added that Buncrana is a ""strong community"" that will ""rally around"" the families.
She also paid tribute to the emergency services and coast guard.
Fianna FÃ¡il councillor FoinÃ¡n Bradley said that the three teenagers involved in the incident ""came to Buncrana a number of years ago with their families"" and that they had ""integrated really well into the community.""
He added they were ""known by many people here in Buncrana"" and the community was ""very, very fond of them"".
He described the community as ""numb"" following the incident.
""There is a very sombre air over the whole area this morning."""

Reflecting on current conflicts, the newly selected pontiff called for a ""lasting peace"" in the war in Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, and welcomed Saturday's agreement to end recent hostilities between India and Pakistan.
He said he was ""deeply hurt"" by events in Gaza, expressed hope for a ""lasting accord"" between India and Pakistan, and wished for a ""authentic, true and lasting peace"" in Ukraine.
The Pope also recited the Regina Caeli prayer, in honour of the Virgin Mary, to the crowd in St Peter's Square.
Pope Leo was chosen as the new leader of the Catholic Church on Thursday following the death of his predecessor, Pope Francis, and a two-day conclave in Vatican City. 
On Saturday, he visited a shrine outside Rome before praying at Francis' tomb inside the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.
Pope Leo will be formally inaugurated at a Mass in St Peter's Square next week on 18 May.
Three years ago, as Bishop Robert Prevost, he denounced Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine as an imperialist war and condemned crimes against humanity he said were being committed there.
On Sunday, he restricted himself to echoing his predecessor, Francis, in calling for peace.
""I would also like to address the powerful people of the world, repeating the always current call: 'no more war',"" he told the crowd from the central balcony of St Peter's Basilica.
""The immense tragedy of the Second World War ended 80 years ago...now we're facing the tragedy of a third world war in pieces.""
Pope Leo called for a ""lasting peace"" in the war in Ukraine and said he was ""deeply hurt"" by events in Gaza
A large crowd gathered to hear Pope Leo's first Sunday address
People from across the world joined the crowds to watch Pope Leo's first address
Pope Leo called for a ceasefire in the Middle East and Ukraine
The pontiff earlier highlighted the importance of missionary work and discussion
The pontiff continued: ""I carry in my heart the suffering of the beloved Ukrainian people. 
""May whatever is possible be done to reach an authentic, true and lasting peace as quickly as possible. May all the prisoners be freed. May children return to their families.
""And I am deeply hurt by what is happening in the Gaza Strip. 
""May a ceasefire immediately come into effect. May humanitarian aid be allowed into the civilian population and may all hostages be freed.""
He added: ""I was happy to hear on the other hand that there was a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, and I hope that through the coming negotiations we might soon come to a lasting accord.""
His remarks came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin set out competing plans for a peace process to bring the three-year invasion of Ukraine to an end.
In the Middle East, Israel has cut off all humanitarian aid entering Gaza and resumed its military offensive in the Palestinian territory following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement.
Meanwhile, India and Pakistan agreed to a tentative ceasefire on Saturday after days of cross-border military strikes that followed an attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir on 22 April.
It has been a busy week for the pontiff, who held his first Mass as Pope in the Sistine chapel on Friday before speaking to cardinals on Saturday.
Pope Leo prayed before the simple white marble tomb of his predecessor on Saturday
During this meeting, he described himself as an unworthy choice for Pope, and vowed to continue the ""precious legacy"" of his predecessor.
He highlighted the importance of missionary work and discussion - as well as care for those he called the ""least and the rejected"".
He explained he had chosen the name Leo after a 19th-century Pope known for his teaching on social justice. 
The new Pope also suggested the development of artificial intelligence and other advances meant the church was necessary today for the defence of human dignity and justice.
He is due to hold an audience with the media on Monday ahead of his inauguration next Sunday. 
As part of that Mass he will deliver a homily in the presence of numerous heads of state and dignitaries.
The 69-year-old is the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter, and the first American to become a pontiff. He will lead members of the Catholic Church's global community of 1.4bn people.
Born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, he worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there. He also has Peruvian nationality.
Although Leo was born in the US, the Vatican described him as the second pope from the Americas. Pope Francis, from Argentina, was the first.
Pope Leo is widely seen as a moderate who can offer ""continuity"" and ""unity"" following the death of his predecessor last month. 
The new pontiff is believed to have shared Francis' views on migrants, the poor and the environment.
In his first speech he told the crowds he wanted ""to walk together with you as a united Church searching all together for peace and justice""."

His post on X came shortly after Donald Trump demanded Ukraine agree to Putin's offer of direct talks between the two countries in Turkey.
""There is no point in prolonging the killings. And I will be waiting for Putin in TÃ¼rkiye on Thursday. Personally,"" Zelensky wrote.
He had earlier said his country was open to talks with Russia but only after a ceasefire was in place.
Western powers called for a 30-day pause in fighting to begin on Monday after European leaders spearheading the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" met in Kyiv on Saturday.
Putin's offer of direct talks followed that intervention. 
On Sunday Trump then posted on social media that Ukraine should agree to this ""immediately"" and it would provide clarity on whether there was a way to end the war.
""At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly"" he said, adding: ""Have the meeting, now!""
In his post, Zelensky said he hoped Russia would agree to the ceasefire before the talks.
""We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy,"" he said.
In a late-night address, Putin invited Ukraine to take part in ""serious negotiations"" over the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Putin said he could ""not rule out"" the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing ""a new truce"" - but did not address the calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly.
The Russian leader said: ""This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts.""
Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks on Thursday would be ""the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace""
Moscow has previously said that before Russia could consider a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine.
The Ukrainian president played host in Kyiv to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Poland's Donald Tusk, who later called Trump to discuss their plan.
Sir Keir told the BBC the US president was ""absolutely clear"" that their suggestion of an immediate ceasefire was a ""demand that must be met"".
Appearing at a news conference with Zelensky, the leaders warned that ""new and massive"" sanctions would be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors should Putin not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire ""in the air, at sea and on land"".
Russia and Ukraine last held direct negotiations in March 2022 in Istanbul, shortly after Moscow launched its invasion.
More than three years later, both sides have agreed, in principle, to resume negotiations. But talks and a deal are very different things. Both sides seemingly retain their red lines, which are as far apart as ever."

A fourth round of talks between the US and Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme have taken place in Oman, with both sides agreeing to meet again.
US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff said the discussions in Muscat were encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described them as ""difficult but useful"". 
The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme.
Donald Trump pulled out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018.
He previously warned of possible military action against Iran's nuclear facilities if the fresh set of talks, which began in April, do not succeed.
Two previous rounds of the negotiations were held in Muscat with one taking place  in the Omani embassy in Rome.
A senior US official said the latest discussions lasted more than three hours, adding:   ""Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements. 
""We are encouraged by today's outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.""
Speaking to Iranian state TV, Araghchi said the talks had been ""more serious and more direct"" than on previous occasions. 
""The two sides have now a better understanding of each other's positions. We can characterise the talks today as moving forward.""
But Araghchi said ""contradictory positions taken by the US in the media is not acceptable to us as they do not help the negotiations"".
The talks came in the same week that Witkoff said in an interview with US media outlet Breitbart News that the US expects Iran to dismantle its uranium enrichment activities.
Araghchi said: ""Enrichment is an issue that Iran will not give up and there is no room for compromise on it. However, its dimensions, levels, or amounts might change for a period to allow confidence-building.""
Iran insists its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it will never seek to develop or acquire nuclear weapons.
However, since Trump pulled out of the 2015 agreement - which expires later this year - Iran has increasingly breached restrictions imposed by the existing nuclear deal in retaliation for crippling US sanctions reinstated seven years ago, and has stockpiled enough highly-enriched uranium to make several bombs.
Under the terms of the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to only enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity for the next 15 years.
In February, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog reported that Tehran had stockpiled uranium enriched to 60% purity and could swiftly move to 90%, which would be weapons-grade.
The 2015 nuclear deal took nearly two years of intensive negotiations. At the start of this new effort to reach an agreement, Iran's programme is far more developed and complex, and the wider region is far more volatile."

The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned chess until further notice due to fears the game is a source of gambling. 
Officials said the game has been prohibited indefinitely until its compatibility with Islamic law can be determined.
Chess is the latest sport to be restricted by the Taliban. Women are essentially barred from participating in sport at all.
Since seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban has steadily imposed laws and regulations that reflect its austere vision of Islamic law.
On Sunday, Atal Mashwani, the spokesman of the Taliban government's sports directorate, said chess in Islamic sharia law is ""considered a means of gambling"".
""There are religious considerations regarding the sport of chess,"" he told AFP news agency.
""Until these considerations are addressed, the sport of chess is suspended in Afghanistan.""

The Taliban's broken promises
One cafe owner in Kabul, who has hosted informal chess competitions in recent years, said he would respect the decision but it would hurt his business.
""Young people don't have a lot of activities these days, so many came here everyday,"" Azizullah Gulzada said. 
""They would have a cup of tea and challenge their friends to a game of chess.""
He also noted that chess is played in other Muslim-majority countries.
Last year, the authorities banned free fighting such as mixed martial arts (MMA) in professional competition, saying it was too ""violent"" and ""problematic with respect to sharia"".
""It was found that the sport is problematic with respect to Sharia and it has many aspects which are contradictory to the teachings of Islam,"" a Taliban spokesperson said last August.
MMA competitions were effectively outlawed in 2021 when the Taliban introduced legislation prohibiting ""face-punching""."

A single vote in a Quebec riding has brought Canada's Liberal Party one seat closer to holding a majority in parliament. 
A judicial recount in the Terrebonne riding declared Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste the victor with 23,352 votes, ahead of Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois incumbent Nathalie Sinclair-DesgagnÃ©, who received 23,351.
The result gives the Liberal Party 170 seats in the House of Commons, two seats shy of the 172 required for a majority.
In a statement on social media, Auguste thanked the citizens of Terrebonne for their trust and promised to ""get to work"".
Canada's election rules require a recount if a candidates wins by less than 0.1% of the votes cast.
Officials had initially called Terrebonne for Auguste the day after the election, but during the validation process - which is when Election Canada confirms numbers but does not recount votes - Sinclair-DesgagnÃ© had taken the lead.
Superior Court of Quebec Justice Danielle Turcotte oversaw the recount.
Recounts are underway in three other ridings, according to the CBC.
The Terrebonne result adds to the political comeback for the Liberal Party in Canada, which earlier this year seemed destined for an electoral drubbing.
However, Donald Trump's return to the White House and the subsequent trade war he sparked with Canada turned the country's 28 April election into a referendum on how its leadership would deal with the United States.
Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal Party won enough seats to form a government, but was three seats shy of an outright majority.
As results stand, the Conservative Party has 143 seats, the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois has 22, the NDP has seven, and the Green Party holds one seat."

Former British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari has told BBC News she is ""so happy"" to be in the UK and is thankful to those here who campaigned for her release from Gaza.
The 28-year-old was released from Hamas captivity after being held for more than 15 months after she was kidnapped from her home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023.
Ms Damari, who is visiting the UK for the first time since her release in January, said she was happy to be ""home finally"", as she was surrounded by supporters outside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. 
""Thank you to everyone for praying for me, and shouting my name without knowing me. I don't really have the words to say how thankful I am for that,"" she told the crowd.
""I'm home finally, and with you it's more than a home. It's like a family,"" she said,  adding with a smile that she hopes Spurs will win today. 
Some 59 hostages remain in Gaza, with about 21 thought to still be alive. 
""They need to bring the hostages back now. It's not something to talk about, they just need to bring them home,"" Ms Damari told the BBC.
Later she said that at times she never thought she would make it back to the UK and that she was thankful to everyone in Britain who campaigned for her and her mother Mandy, originally from South London, who led efforts to get her released.
Dressed in a Spurs shirt, Ms Damari hugged her mum, who said: ""I'm so glad she's back and so glad she's here with people who supported her all the time.""
The British-Israeli national was shot in the leg and hand when she was dragged from her home on Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October. Hamas also shot and killed her dog.
She was taken from the safe room of her house with her friends Ziv and Gali Berman. 
The 27-year-old twins are still being held by Hamas and Ms Damari said she is doing all she can to get them and the other 59 hostages - not all of them alive - back to their families in Israel.
Emily pictured with Tottenham Hotspur footballer James Maddison
Earlier this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while they had believed 24 hostages were still alive, there was now uncertainty about the fate of three of them.
Outside the stadium, Ms Damari held a banner showing her two friends and told the crowd: ""May the 59 hostages be home soon. Gali and Ziv Berman are very, very close friends of mine, and I hope they bring him home. Today.""
Her mother Mandy said: ""We need all the 59 hostages back. Gali and Ziv are Emily's friends and it's so important to all the families that the hostages in Gaza have to come back.""
During the Hamas attack, Ms Damariâ¯lost two of her fingers and did not receive proper medical treatment while being held. 
But her injured hand gesture that she flashed on her release has been seen as a symbol of defiance and resilience in Israel, appearing on posters, t-shirts and memes across the country. 
About 1,200 people were killed by Hamas-led gunmen that day, while Gali and Ziv were among 251 others who were taken hostage.
More than 52,780 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Ms Damari has yet to talk about the details of her captivity, but at a visit this weekend to a London synagogue, where an empty seat which had a poster of her on it during the 471 days she was held, she said she had prayed every day as a hostage, and that however terrible it was, each day she remembered she was thankful to be alive.
Ms Damari's mother, Mandy, broke down in tears as she thanked the UK and the British Jewish community for supporting and campaigning for her daughter while she was being held.
Ms Damari was able to spend time with her British family this weekend, although the joy at returning to the UK was tinged with some sadness as her British grandfather died while she was still held by Hamas.
When she returns to Israel she faces another operation on her leg and hand as the damage caused by the bullet wounds have still not fully healed.
But she is determined that as she now has her freedom, her friends and fellow hostages should soon follow her."

Koyo Kouoh, who has died aged 57, was one of the art world's leading figures and a fierce advocate of African creatives.
A Cameroon-born curator, Kouoh had been at the height of her career. 
She was due to become the first African woman to lead next year's Venice Biennale, one of the world's most prestigious contemporary art events, and led one of Africa's largest contemporary art museums.
The cause of Kouoh's unexpected death has not yet been made public. The curator passed away in Switzerland, according to reports.
South African artist Candice Breitz described Kouoh as ""magnificently intelligent, endlessly energetic and formidably elegant"". 
Otobong Nkanga, a Nigerian visual artist, called the late curator a source of ""warmth, generosity and brilliance"". 
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also spoke of Kouoh's impact, saying her passing ""leaves a void in the world of contemporary art"".
Kouoh's colourful life began in 1967, when she was born in Cameroon, a Central African country with a rich artistic heritage.
She grew up in the country's largest city, Douala, before moving to Switzerland aged 13.
There, she studied business administration and banking but, in a pivotal moment, chose not to pursue finance as a career.
""I am fundamentally uninterested in profit,"" she explained in a 2023 interview with the New York Times.
Rather than building on her degree, Kouoh assisted migrant women as a social worker and began to immerse herself in the world of art.
In 2021, Kouoh was invited by French President Emmanuel Macron to a conference about the restitution of African artefacts
She gave birth to her son in Switzerland during the 90s, an experience she described as ""profoundly transformative"", external. She would go on to adopt three other children.
Fed up with life in the Swiss city of Zurich, Kouoh returned to Africa in 1996.
She worked as a curator in Senegalese capital city Dakar, before founding Raw Material Company, an expansive, independent art hub.
Just last week, and six years into her role as the director of South Africa's Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, Kouoh reflected on her love for Dakar.
""Dakar made me who I am today,"" she told the Financial Times, external.
""It's the place I came of age professionally, where I really became a curator and an exhibition-maker... I'm in Cape Town now but, mentally, I live in Dakar. It's the one and only place for me.""
When Kouoh took the top job at Zeitz, Africa's biggest contemporary art museum, the institution was in crisis.
Founding director Mark Coetzee had been suspended in 2018 following allegations of staff harrasment and later resigned. 
Kouoh has been widely credited with turning Zeitz's fortunes around, leading it through the scandal, as well as the Covid pandemic.
""For me, it became a duty to salvage this institution,"" she told The Art World: What Ifâ¦?!, external podcast.
""I was convinced that the failure of Zeitz, if it had failed would've been the failure of all of us African art professionals in the field, somehow indirectly.""
Kouoh took the helm of the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa in 2019
As Zeitz's director and curator, Kouoh oversaw a number of acclaimed exhibitions, including When We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting. The show, which brings together works by black artists from the last century, is currently on display in Brussels.
In a statement announcing Kouoh's ""sudden"" death, Zeitz expressed its ""profound sorrow"" and said that, out of respect, the museum would be closed ""until further notice"".
In her Financial Times interview last week, Kouoh challenged the idea that death would bring an end to her endeavours.
""I do believe in life after death, because IÂ come from an ancestral black education where we believe in parallel lives and realities,"" she said.
""There is no 'after death', 'before death' or 'during life'. It doesn't matter that much. I believe in energies - living or dead - and in cosmic strength.""

President Putin slammed European powers for talking to Russia ""in a boorish manner and with the help of ultimatums"".
He didn't go into detail. He didn't need to. 
This was clearly his response to the ultimatum set by European leaders in Kyiv. 
They had warned Moscow that if Russia didn't agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from Monday, there will be more sanctions against Russia and more military assistance for Ukraine.
On Saturday, Sir Keir Starmer said that ""if he [Putin] is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it"".
The Kremlin's response: we're serious, but we'll show it our way.
Putin's way (his counter proposal) is direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul next Thursday.
But, crucially, no immediate ceasefire.
Starmer asked by BBC if Ukraine ceasefire talks are just an act of symbolism
So, is the Kremlin's offer a serious peace initiative? Or is it simply an attempt by Moscow to play for time and to prolong the war? And, with this proposal, might Russia also be trying to split the Western coalition that is backing Ukraine?
Let's begin with a short, but key question: does Vladimir Putin want peace?
He claims he does. But peace only on Russia's terms. 
Moscow suspects it has little to gain from a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, especially since the Russians believe they currently have the initiative on the battlefield in Ukraine.
Live updates on this story
Frank Gardner: What Trump does next is crucial - and he could go either way
Volodymyr Zelensky hosted world leaders in Kyiv on 10 May including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron
But neither does Russia want to be seen as an obstacle to peace. It's keen to maintain a good relationship with the Donald Trump administration, with which the Kremlin has been working hard on improving ties. 
If a US-Russia rapprochement continues, the Kremlin will be hoping for speedy sanctions relief and an economic boost.
By proposing direct talks in Istanbul, President Putin is sending a signal to the White House: ""I am a man of peace."" 
Why Zelensky can't and won't give up Crimea
But by not committing to an immediate 30-day ceasefire, the likelihood is Russia will continue the war, and push on to seize and occupy more Ukrainian territory. 
The Kremlin leader's vague reference to ""not excluding"" that the Istanbul talks might lead to ""new ceasefires"" will be greeted with deep scepticism by Kyiv.
And when we're talking about war and peace, keep in mind that it was President Putin who ordered the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 
This was his decision, one widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.
He didn't call it a war, though. He portrayed Russia's actions as a ""special military operation"".
Last night, though, Putin declared: ""There is ongoing fighting, war. But we're offering to resume talks that were interrupted, and not by us. What's bad about that?""
The Kremlin may well be calculating that its offer of direct talks in Istanbul will drive a wedge between the US administration and European leaders. 
Following Putin's announcement, President Trump hailed a ""potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine"" in a social media post, and promised to ""continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens"". 
Emmanuel Macron described Putin's offer as a ""first step, but not enough."" The French president also said ""an unconditional ceasefire is not preceded by negotiations.""
Putin announced his proposal in a late-night statement delivered inside the Kremlin. 
I was among a small group of foreign journalists invited to join Russian reporters for what we were told would be a press conference. 
We waited several hours for the event to begin. In the end, the Russian president took no questions. After delivering his statement he left the hall."

The suspects, aged 24, 26 and 27, and widely identified in Japanese media as being Chinese nationals, were detained on Amami, a southerly island where the spiral-shelled crustaceans are a protected species.
Authorities were alerted to the men's live cargo when hotel staff, who had been asked to look after their luggage, noticed the suitcases making a ""rustling noise"", police told local media.
Officers subsequently discovered ""thousands"" of hermit crabs, weighing around 95kg. The third man was found to have a further 65kg in another set of three suitcases.
""Our investigation is ongoing to identify whether they had [the crabs] to sell them, or to keep them as pets, or to eat them,"" a police spokesman told the news agency AFP following the arrests on Wednesday. ""We are reviewing all possibilities.""
Police said the hermit crabs were ""a national treasure"", being a part of Amami Island's plant and animal diversity.
Hermit crabs - so named because they scavenge shells to live in - can regularly be seen on the beaches of the popular tourist destination.
The crabs can be worth up to Â¥20,000 (Â£103), according to the Japan Times."

A ""large-scale air and ground search"" is continuing for a British hiker who has been missing for a week in New Zealand.
More than 40 staff and volunteers are hunting for Eli Sweeting, who is originally from Bristol. The 25-year-old was reported missing on May 4 after failing to return from a solo hike up Mitre Peak, a steep mountain in Milford Sound area of Fiordland National Park on the country's South Island.
New Zealand Police has said they ""remain positive"" despite the challenging terrain, which means at times they can only progress 250 metres (0.1miles) an hour. 
Helicopters, dogs and locals have been assisting with the hunt, and some of his family have also flown out to help.
In a fundraising post, his sister Serena Sweeting described her brother as one of the ""kindest, most compassionate people"". 
""We just want him home safe,"" she said. 
The search party has been focusing on a route heading down the mountain after spotting a light there, but the dense area makes it hard for infrared cameras to detect any signs of movement.
The operation was briefly halted on Wednesday and Thursday due to weather warnings, but resumed again on Friday and Saturday.
Rescue teams have spotted a light on Mitre Peak which they are investigating 
Police confirmed this weekend there was ""large-scale air and ground search effort planned for the coming days"".
The area where Mr Sweeting has hiking has incredibly steep rough terrain, but police said they remained hopeful as Mr Sweeting is an ""experienced hiker"".
The police spokesperson added: ""While the [man] has not yet been located, police remain positive as the search remains ongoing.
""A Land Search and Rescue team stayed near Mitre Peak overnight to continue the search early this morning.""

The Ukrainian leader might have been expected to slam his opposite number in Moscow for not committing to a 30-day ceasefire, as demanded by Kyiv and its Western allies on Saturday.
Instead, writing on X, Zelensky called it ""a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war"".
Zelensky added that Ukraine expected Russia to confirm it would abide by the proposed 30-day ceasefire, starting on Monday.
It's hard to tell if Zelensky really sees Putin's offer of direct talks as a ""positive sign"". This is as much about optics as anything else.
Neither Putin nor Zelensky want to be seen by US President Donald Trump as the obstacle to peace.
Trump's reaction was markedly upbeat. Writing on his Truth Social platform earlier, he hinted once again that this war was close to ending. He wrote: ""A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!""
Putin said he wants to address what he calls ""the root causes of the conflict"".

Steve Rosenberg: Is Putin's offer of talks designed to divide West?
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among the European leaders to visit Kyiv on Saturday
From his perspective, that means Ukraine's unacceptable ambition to be part of a prosperous, democratic Europe rather than returning to Moscow's orbit and become a pliant, satellite nation like Belarus. 
He will also want a firm undertaking that Ukraine will never join Nato.
Moscow demanded on Saturday that, before any ceasefire can start, the West must stop arming Ukraine. 
That of course would leave this country that much less able to fend off Russia's gradual advances on the frontline - or, worse, a new full-scale offensive to take more land.
What Ukraine badly needs from its allies is an uninterrupted flow of air defences to fend off the ever-growing numbers of drones and missiles being fired across the common border at Kyiv and other major cities. 
Shortly after dawn on Sunday, we were woken by an air raid alert and sirens went off as more Russian drones were launched. 
On 9 May, the US Embassy in Kyiv issued a warning to its citizens that there was ""a significant risk of air raids in the coming days"".  
One of the biggest concerns is that the Kremlin may launch another Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile like the one its forces fired at a factory in Dnipro last November. 
With its velocity approaching 10 times the speed of sound, Russia boasts that this missile is ""unstoppable"".
So now the key question is what Trump does next - and this could go either way.
He could decide that his opposite number in Moscow is simply stringing him along, finding one excuse after another not to agree to a ceasefire. 
Or, given his historic warm relations with Putin, will he throw the Russian leader a diplomatic lifeline and put pressure on Ukraine instead to sit down in Istanbul and listen to Moscow's demands, irrespective of whether there is a ceasefire come Monday?"

But the Ukrainian president said: ""We expect Russia to confirm a ceasefire - complete, lasting and credible - starting tomorrow, 12 May, and Ukraine is ready to meet.""
Western powers called for a 30-day pause in fighting to begin on Monday after European leaders spearheading the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" met in Kyiv on Saturday.
A key aide to Zelensky said there must be a ceasefire before direct talks over ending the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - could take place.

Frank Gardner: What Trump does next is crucial - and he could go either way
""First a ceasefire for 30 days, then everything else,"" Andriy Yermak said. ""Russia must not camouflage its desire to continue the war with verbal contortions.""
But Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova insisted talks should occur before a ceasefire.
""Putin was clear: first negotiations about the root causes [of the conflict], then talk of ceasefire,"" she said.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had earlier responded to the call from European allies and the US, saying Moscow would ""have to think this through"" - but warned that ""trying to pressure us is quite useless"".
Putin said in his own statement that he could ""not rule out"" the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing ""a new truce"" - but did not address the calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly.
The Russian leader said the proposed talks should be held in the Turkish city of Istanbul, as they have been before, and that he would speak to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday to discuss the details. 
Zelensky wrote in a social media post on Sunday morning: ""It is a positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war. 
""The entire world has been waiting for this for a very long time. And the very first step in truly ending any war is a ceasefire.
""There is no point in continuing the killing even for a single day.""
Vladimir Putin said the proposed talks on Thursday would be ""the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace""
The Ukrainian president played host on Saturday to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, France's Emmanuel Macron, Germany's Friedrich Merz and Poland's Donald Tusk, who later called Donald Trump to discuss their plan.
Sir Keir later told the BBC the US president was ""absolutely clear"" that their suggestion of an immediate ceasefire was a ""demand that must be met"".
Appearing at a news conference with Zelensky, they warned that ""new and massive"" sanctions would be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors should Putin not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire ""in the air, at sea and on land"".
The four leaders - who make up a significant part of the ""coalition of the willing"" group - formed to reinforce any eventual peace agreement with security guarantees, including the possibility of placing troops in Ukraine.
After the meeting, Zelensky thanked the assembled leaders for ""standing with"" Ukraine.
""Today we will focus on how to build and guarantee real and lasting security,"" he said.
Russian state media also quoted Peskov as saying that statements from Europe were ""generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations"".
Moscow has previously said that before Russia could consider a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine.

Putin later made his own statement. A video showed journalists assembled in a hall inside the Kremlin, listening to the address. 
""This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts,"" he said.
""Who needs peace like that?""
Trump described Putin's announcement as a ""potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine"" in a post on Truth Social. 
""It will be a whole new, and much better world,"" he said, adding that he would ""continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens"".
Putin also accused Ukraine of having repeatedly failed to respond to multiple ceasefire proposals from Moscow, including a 30-day halt in attacks on energy infrastructure and last month's Easter truce.
Another ceasefire Putin flagged was one he ordered in April to coincide with World War Two commemorations. It ended on Saturday at midnight local time (21:00 GMT). 
Kyiv had rejected the unilateral, three-day ceasefire, calling it a ""theatrical show"". 
The Kyiv meeting was a symbolic response to the more than 20 leaders who joined Putin in Moscow a day earlier for the World War Two event.
While the latest ceasefire saw a decrease in fighting, each side accused the other of breaches.
On Thursday - the same day the supposed ceasefire took effect - Ukraine accused Russia of more than 730 violations and said it was responding ""appropriately"". 
Russia's defence ministry insisted the truce was being observed, before accusing Ukraine of 488 violations.
Overnight into Sunday, the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said Russia launched over 100 drones - slightly less than the average number immediately before the start of the ceasefire.
It also said there were 161 clashes along the front lines.
""In spite of everything, we are offering the Kyiv authorities to resume the negotiations... resume direct talks, and I stress, without any preconditions,"" Putin said on Saturday. 
The last direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv took place in 2022, the year Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

A ceasefire between India and Pakistan appears to have held overnight into Sunday, after the two nations accused each other of ""violations"" just hours after a deal was reached.
Days of cross-border military strikes had preceded the US-brokered deal, marking the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades.
US President Donald Trump praised India and Pakistan's leaders for agreeing the ceasefire in fresh comments on Sunday morning, saying millions of people could have died without it. 
This comes after explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir hours after the deal was announced, with both sides accusing each other of violations.
The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan denies any involvement. 
US President Donald Trump announced the ""full and immediate"" ceasefire on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday. He said it had been brokered by the US. 
Pakistan's foreign minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that ""three dozen countries"" were involved in the diplomacy. 
But hours after the announcement, residents - and BBC reporters - in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing explosions and seeing flashes in the sky.
Indian Foreign Secretary Misri accused Pakistan of ""repeated violations"" of the deal, and said his country's armed forces would give ""an appropriate response"". 
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Pakistan remained committed to implementing the deal, ""notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas"", and said troops on the ground should ""exercise restraint"". 
India confirms ceasefire with Pakistan
Kashmir is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from the UK in 1947.
It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it.
Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had ""worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action"".
""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" he added. 
Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached ""for the benefit of everybody"".
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said following the announcement that India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.
He said he and US Vice-President JD Vance had spent 48 hours with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including their respective Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif.
In a further Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump repeated praise for India and Pakistan's leaders for understanding it was ""time to stop the current aggression"". 
""I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,"" he added.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed ""all efforts to de-escalate the conflict"".
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK has been ""engaged"" in talks for ""some days"", with Foreign Secretary David Lammy speaking to both sides.
""I'm pleased to see today that there's a ceasefire,"" Sir Keir said. ""The task now is to make sure that that is enduring and is lasting.""
The recent fighting came after two weeks of tension following the killing of 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam.
Survivors of the 22 April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national, said the militants had singled out Hindu men.
The Indian defence ministry said its strikes this week were part of a ""commitment"" to hold ""accountable"" those responsible for the attack. Pakistan described them as ""unprovoked"".
Pakistan said Indian air strikes and cross-border fire since Wednesday had killed 36 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while India's army reported at least 21 civilians deaths from Pakistani shelling.
Fighting intensified overnight on Friday, with both countries accusing each other of targeting airbases and other military sites."

A World War One soldier has been buried with full military honours nearly 108 years after his death.
Pte John Tame, who was from Windsor and served in the Royal Berkshire Regiment, was killed in Belgium in August 1917.
His remains were found during road works at Zonnebeke, near Ypres, in May 2018, with a cap badge and a Royal Berkshire Regiment shoulder title found nearby.
A DNA match to a living relative confirmed his identity and he was laid to rest at the New Irish Farm cemetery, near Ypres, on Thursday.
Pte Tame's older brothers L/Cpl Alfred Tame and Cpl William George Tame, who served in the same regiment, were both killed during the Battle of Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915.
Their bodies have never been found and they are commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial, about 11 miles (18km) from where their brother is now buried.
Pte Tame's brothers are remembered on the Ploegsteert Memorial, near Ypres 
On Friday, on the 110th anniversary of their deaths, their family and a party from 2nd Battalion the Rifles visited the memorial to remember the missing brothers.
Keith Brooks, Pte Tame's great nephew, helped the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) to identify him by giving a DNA sample.
""John and his brothers Alfred and William have been remembered by the family from just photographs and vague memories from those who have now long passed,"" Mr Brooks said.
""Now, after finding John's remains, he is more than just a distant photograph. This has made him more real along with his story for future generations.
""This has all been achieved because of the excellent work the MOD do with all the research and investigations, giving missing people who have served their country the funeral they all greatly deserve.""
Rosie Barron, who works for the JCCC, said: ""It has been an honour to work with The Rifles to give Pte Tame the full military funeral that he deserves and to have conducted the research which led to his identification.
""It has also been a privilege to meet Keith and to have shared this experience with him and his family.""

US President Donald Trump's administration is ""actively looking at"" suspending habeas corpus, the principle that a person should be able to challenge their detention in court.
Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, says the legal principle is a ""privilege"" that could be suspended to make it easier to detain and deport immigrants.
Recent court challenges by migrants and dissenting students who have been held in immigration detention centres have cited habeas corpus as a reason for their release. 
But what the legal procedure does - and what could happen if it were to be suspended - is complex.
Scholars say the principle that a person should not be illegally imprisoned pre-dates the Magna Carta, and has been a cornerstone of the legal system in the UK, US and other democratic countries around the world for centuries. 
Roughly translated from Latin, habeas corpus means ""you should have the body"" - as in, a person must be able to appear before a court so that a judge can assess if that person has been lawfully detained. 
Also known as the ""Great Writ of Liberty"", habeas corpus grants prisoners the right to challenge their imprisonment in a court of law.
Article One of the US Constitution states that ""the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it"".
While this is the only time habeas corpus is mentioned in the Constitution, it has become an important part of US law - and has frequently been fought over in the courts, including the US Supreme Court.
Abraham Lincoln became the first US president to suspend habeas corpus in 1861, during the American Civil War. 
That led to a showdown with Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, who said it was Congress - not the executive branch of government - that had the power to suspend the writ.
Lincoln continued to suspend habeas corpus in specific incidences, according to the National Constitution Center, external, and in 1863 Congress approved suspending it for the duration of the war when ""the public safety may require it"". 
It was also suspended several times in the years following the Civil War, during the Reconstruction period, to quash rebellions by the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group.
After the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese in World War Two, habeas corpus was suspended in Hawaii, which paved the way for the arrest of Japanese Americans on the island.
The courts have found that both US citizens and non-citizens have the right to habeas corpus. In 2008, the US Supreme Court extended this to include non-citizens detained in a foreign prison - such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. 
But just because prisoners have the right to challenge their detention, it does not guarantee they will be able to leave custody. 
Succeeding with a habeas corpus petition is extremely rare - most people who are detained have been detained for lawful reasons, courts have generally found.
Asadullah Haroon Gul was the first Guantanamo detainee to win a habeas corpus petition in 2021. He was transferred back to Afghanistan more than a decade, external after the US Supreme Court found that detainees had habeas corpus privileges.
But as Trump's administration has ramped up arrests of illegal immigrants and student dissenters, habeas corpus has received renewed legal interest.
In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants being deported under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act must be given enough notice of their removal to file petitions. It temporarily blocked some deportations in Texas for this reason.
Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained after becoming a leading figure in pro-Palestinian campus protests, has filed his own habeas corpus petition, as he is in the middle of deportation hearings."

In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"".
Behind the scenes, US mediators, alongside diplomatic backchannels and regional players, proved critical in pulling the nuclear-armed rivals back from the brink, experts say.
However, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility. 
India accused Pakistan of ""repeated violations"" while Pakistan insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing ""responsibility and restraint.""
Before Trump's ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.
After a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir -  triggering days of aerial clashes, artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of missile strikes on each other's airbases. 
The rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other's attacks.
Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir
Drone war opens a new chapter in India-Pakistan conflict
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio (left) and President Donald Trump
Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, says US   Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on 9 May ""might have been the crucial point"".
""There's still much we don't know about the roles of various international actors, but it's clear over the past three days that at least three countries were working to de-escalate - the US, of course, but also the UK and Saudi Arabia,"" she says.
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that ""three dozen countries"" were involved in the diplomacy - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.
""One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented further escalation,"" Ms Madan says.
This isn't the first time US mediation has helped defuse an IndiaâPakistan crisis.
In his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was woken up to speak with an unnamed ""Indian counterpart"", who feared Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.
Kashmiri men greeted each other after the ceasefire announcement in Srinagar
Former Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US role in calming the conflict.
But diplomats say there is little doubt the US played an important role in defusing the crisis this time.
""The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo claimed they averted nuclear war. While they'll likely exaggerate, they may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad,"" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.
Yet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.
As tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the US was not going to get involved in a war that's ""fundamentally none of our business"".
""We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its gripes with Pakistan... America can't tell the Indians to lay down their arms. We can't tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so we're going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic channels, "" he said in a television interview. 
Meanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: ""I know both [leaders of India and Pakistan] very well, and I want to see them work it out... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now"".
Pakistani people celebrated after the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, in Hyderabad, Sindh province
Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared to be the only difference from previous occasions.
""The American role was a continuation of past patterns, but with one key difference - this time, they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did they step in to manage it,"" Mr Haider told the BBC.
Experts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent ""dual signals"", retaliating militarily while announcing a National Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear overhang. 
The NCA controls and takes operational decisions regarding Pakistan's nuclear weapons. 
This was around the time US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stepped in.
""The US was indispensable. This outcome would not have occurred without Secretary Rubio's efforts,"" Ashley J Tellis, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the BBC.
What also helped was Washington's deepening ties with Delhi.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal rapport with Trump, plus the US's broader strategic and economic stakes, gave the US administration diplomatic leverage to push both nuclear-armed rivals towards de-escalation.
Indian diplomats see three key peace tracks that happened this time, much like after PulwamaâBalakot in 2019: 
US and UK pressure
Saudi mediation, with the Saudi junior foreign minister visiting both capitals
The direct India-Pakistan channel between the two national security advisors (NSAs)
Despite shifting global priorities and a hands-off posture at first, the US ultimately stepped in as the indispensable mediator between South Asia's nuclear rivals. 
Whether overstated by its own officials or underacknowledged by Delhi and Islamabad, experts believe the US's role as crisis manager remains as vital - and as complicated - as ever.
Doubts do, however, linger over the ceasefire's durability after Saturday's events, with some Indian media reporting it was essentially brokered by senior military officials of the two countries - not the US.
""This ceasefire is bound to be a fragile one. It came about very quickly, amid sky-high tensions. India appears to have interpreted it differently than did the US and Pakistan,"" Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, told the BBC. 
""Also, since it was put together so hastily, the accord may lack the proper guarantees and assurances one would need at such a tense moment."""

A serial con-artist who posed as a child therapist and scammed families out of money for a fake trip to Lapland left people terrified, one of her victims has said.
Samantha Cookes used multiple identities - including a nanny, an arts teacher and a surrogate mother - to con families in the UK and Ireland between 2011 and 2024.
Over the years she has been convicted of multiple offences and was sentenced to three years in prison earlier in 2025 for social welfare fraud.
Now her victims have told a new documentary by the BBC and RTÃ about their ordeal with the serial scammer â including one mother who was so concerned about her nine-year-old's safety that she slept with a hatchet beside her bed.
Dublin woman Lynn McDonald told the filmmakers that Cookes, who was born in Gloucestershire, England, had developed a bond of trust with her daughter Ellie after they met in 2016.
But that bond unravelled after she and others discovered she was a scam artist.
Cookes, now 36, later fled, leaving Lynn worried ""she would come back in the middle of the night and take my child"".
Samantha Cookes scammed families in both the UK and Ireland
Lynn first met Cookes, who she knew as Lucy Fitzwilliams, in 2016.
She was introduced to the scammer by a friend when she was experiencing a difficult time and needed more support.
Lynn's younger daughter, Daisy, was born in 2013 with Rett syndrome,, external a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability.
In her guise as a child therapist, Cookes came twice a week to give Ellie, Lynn's older daughter, one-on-one time.
""There was definitely a bond of trust. Ellie was trusting her with her secrets and her worries,"" Lynn said.
""I don't think anybody, when they meet her, knew what's really underneath that skin.""
Hillery Geelan said she met Cookes when she was ""desperate"" for help
Hillery Geelan, another mother from Dublin who was deceived by Cookes, said: ""She finds your weak point and your weak point is always going to be your children.""
She said she was ""desperate"" for help with her son Rhys, who has autism, and had ""nowhere else to turn"".
Cookes earned the families' trust, seeking donations for a women's refuge and collecting money for the fake Lapland trip.
Lynn paid a deposit of Â£400 to Cookes.
However, her behaviour around the trip was starting to raise suspicions. 
""Each one [of us] had involved other people, and each one of us who had involved other people had to collect the money,"" Hillery said. 
""We started Googling how many seats were on airplanes but, by the sounds of it and the amount of people that we were involving, we had personally sold at least five airplanes.""
In the end, the women discovered there was no Lapland trip and no women's refuge - although they had given Cookes donations of food, clothes and money.
When Cookes realised the families knew she was a scammer, she fled.
Cookes, pictured before she moved to Ireland
Hillery said the families ""lived in fear for a very long time"" while Lynn recalled that Cookes had asked her to sign a consent form for the Lapland trip.
She did not sign it but the form, which would have allowed Cookes to take Ellie abroad without Lynn, raised her fears that the scammer could have tried to abduct her daughter.
""When you discover that Lapland isn't happening... you question: 'Why did she want consent to take my child abroad?'"" Lynn said.
She said when Cookes fled, it left her afraid as nobody knew where she was.
""We had police circling our area, our home was on red alert, I had to have cameras put up around my home,"" she said.
The BBC put all of the allegations to Cookes, but she did not respond.
Cookes' story began to unravel further when she appeared on TikTok in 2022 under the name Carrie Jade Williams, giving an account of allegedly living with the degenerative Huntington's disease. 
She received support and even financial aid, including welfare payments from the Irish state.

The end of World War Two in Europe was both a time of celebration and a ""very, very mixed thing emotionally"" for thousands of East Anglian families.
While VE (Victory in Europe) Day celebrations were taking place across the country, many were still waiting to hear news about the men from the Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire regiments, captured by the Japanese at Singapore in 1942.
Felix Jackson, from Ely Museum, Cambridgeshire, said ""no official celebrations were planned at all"" in the city, although a dance was held for ""the younger ones"".
""We talk about the impact of heavy casualties on the World War One Pals Battalions [units comprising men for the same area, workplace or social group] but the fall of Singapore was just as devastating on these communities,"" he said. 
""It's beyond imagination, really, because everybody's gone in the battalion at the same time, down to the lowest private, and there's a lack of information and clarity about what's happened to them for months and, in some cases, years.""
Swaffham hairdresser Tom Allard was serving with the Suffolk Regiment's 4th and 5th Battalions when they were captured by the Japanese in early 1942
Many of those who survived - like Tom Allard from Swaffham, Norfolk - could never bring themselves to talk about their treatment at the hands of the Japanese army, according to Swaffham Museum archivist Sue Gattuso.
Conscripted into the Suffolk Regiment, Mr Allard ""described how he was captured and marched to Changi Prison with the shells falling all around them"", she said. 
Mr Jackson said: ""We know now how badly treated they were and how many of them died from malnutrition, disease, starvation and torture.""
The families were to learn how badly the Japanese Army treated Allied prisoners of war
After the war, Mr Allard became treasurer of Swaffham's FEPOW (Far East Prisoner of War) Association branch.
Another founder member, postman George Whalebelly, was captured with the 4th Royal Norfolks and spent nearly four years as a prisoner of war.
Dr Gattuso said: ""He described building huts in the swamps at Changi and when he was moved to another camp, being made to build a shrine on a golf course to the fallen Japanese, before being sent to build a railway through the jungle.
""He was put on medical work and they had to use anything at hand for dressings; rice poultices were used on ulcers.""
His family had received a postcard from him while in captivity, so unlike many, they had had some news. 
""But I've always wondered about the families whose loved ones were captured or whose fate was unknown. What did they feel about VE Day?"" she said.
""No end of people have approached the museum asking how was it was celebrated in Swaffham in 1945. We've just one photo; they held their celebration the next year.""
Ely's Sgt George Easingwood was awarded the British Empire Medal for his bravery and devotion as a medic, which saved many of the prisoners, said Felix Jackson
The captured Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk battalions were Territorial Army units that drew upon their traditional recruiting grounds across East Anglia.
This meant in places like Ely or Swaffham, ""everybody knew someone"" who had been captured, said Mr Jackson, co-founder of the Cambridgeshire Regiment Research Trust.
""They were open about the fact VE Day was a very, very mixed thing emotionally for Ely; there were celebrations, but they were muted,"" he said. 
The 1st and 2nd Cambridgeshire battalions were about 1,900 strong when they reached Singapore; by 1945, 784 officers and men had died fighting or while prisoners.
Three of the Royal Norfolks' territorial battalions were captured at Singapore - about 2,000 men - and about 600 were to die in captivity. 
Returned FEPOWs from Ely, marching past the city's war memorial in November 1945
Huge efforts were made to find the last known locations of the men who went missing at Singapore, even during the war, said Mr Jackson.
""There's a powerful story of a chap from the Ely Signal Corps who was part of the force to recapture Singapore - he had a list of names of friends who had disappeared three years earlier,"" he said.
In the aftermath of VE Day, the war effort switched to the Pacific conflict. 
Mr Jackson said: ""For a lot of the service personnel, there was the fear and awareness that 'The job's not done, you're now off to the Far East.'""
No-one was aware that World War Two was in its last few months, with liberation for Allied prisoners of only coming after the dropping of nuclear bombs on Japan. 
Swaffham had an active FEPOW Association branch for decades and members can be seen here on 15 February 1959, marking the anniversary of the fall of Singapore

She was just 26 years old at the time - and had clearly impressed Botswana's incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years.
It was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation - and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running.
His main focus, he said, was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds, telling the BBC ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution - ""to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others"".
Key to this was finding a suitable ambassador - and Chombo was clearly it: a young woman already committed to various causes.
He made her minister of youth and gender.
""I've never been more proud to be young,"" she told the BBC at the ministry's headquarters in the capital, Gaborone.
""I'm a young person living in Botswana, passionate about youth development, gender equality, but also so passionate about the development of children.""
The beauty queen did not campaign to be an MP - she is what is called a specially elected member of parliament - and is now one of just six female MPs in the 69-member National Assembly.
Chombo said becoming an MP and then minister came as a complete surprise to her.
""I got appointed by a president who had never met me,"" she said.
""Miss World and the journey that I thought I was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which I would be seen for this very role.""
It was her crowning as Miss Botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change, while trying to inspire other young women.
It also gave her the opportunity to set up the Lesego Chombo Foundation, which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas â and which she is still involved with, its projects funded by corporate companies and others.
""We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented. I'm very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation,"" she said.
Lesego Chombo, now 27,  is an associate at a law firm in Gaborone
As she prepared for last year's Miss World pageant, she said: ""I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.""
Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.
It also has a high level of unemployment - 28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.
Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: ""Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.
""But it's not just the rate of unemployment, it's also just the sphere of youth development.
""It's lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.""
Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.
With Botswana's anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs - when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services - were actually reached.
The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.
Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy - something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.
And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.
While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.
Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.
According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.
""It hurts to know that it could be me next,"" she admitted.
A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create ""peace desks"" at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.
At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.
This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season - this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.
The minister reiterated - on several occasions, including before parliament in March, external - that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.
But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.
She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.
""We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age,"" Chombo said.
""We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.
""It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.""
Lesego Chombo has used her fame to push her projects for social change - focusing on young people
She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs ""to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence"".
""I hear a lot of people say: 'Why do you speak of women more than men?'
""It's because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].
""But when we speak of gender equality, we're saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.""
Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her - saying that women had to work ""10 times harder"" to succeed.
""[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that it's not an easy thing.
""As women, we face so many pressures: 'A woman cannot do this. A woman can't do that.  A woman can't be young and in leadership.' I'm currently facing that.""
She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: ""She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.
""She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.""
Chombo is serious about this. The beauty queen-cum-lawyer-cum-minister knows she has made history - but is also aware that her real work has only just begun.
""Impact. Tangible impact. That's what success would look like to me,"" she said.
""I want to look back and see that it is there and it is sustainable. That when I leave, someone else is able to carry it through.""

But it's been weeks since she has done that.
Freighters, the restaurant where she works, is one of the first places people can grab a bite after crossing the US-Canada border between Sarnia, Ontario, and Port Huron, Michigan.
The Blue Water Bridge, which connects the US and Canada, is in full view from the restaurant's windows.
""A lot of people used to come over and say 'we're here for the view',"" she says of Canadian diners. ""I haven't heard that at all recently.""
Border towns noticed almost instantly when US President Donald Trump began imposing tariffs on countries around the world and saying he wanted to make Canada the 51st US state - because the number of Canadians crossing the border plummeted.
Kristina Lampert
Border crossings between the US and Canada are down some 17% since Trump started bringing in tariffs, according to CBP data.
Canadian's car trips to the US are down almost 32% compared to March 2024, according to Statistics Canada.
Like many of the towns that dot along the 5,525 mile (8,891km) border, the economies of Port Huron and Sarnia are linked and in some ways dependent on one another. Port Huron is a manufacturing town of less than 30,000 people with a quaint downtown and lots of retail, offering visitors an enticing opportunity for a day-trip.
On a day where there is little traffic, a Sarnia resident can cross the border and be in Michigan in a matter of minutes.
Many of these towns faced their first test more than five years ago when the Covid-19 pandemic shut crossings down for 19 months and left local economies reeling.
Now, they are seeing a second economic hit due to Trump's trade war, with many Canadians choosing to ""buy Canadian"" and reducing travel to the US in response to the fraying relationship between the two neighbouring countries.
One place this is being felt is at Sarnia's Duty Free, the last place you can purchase goods before leaving Canada and entering the US. The shelves of perfume and liquor are fuller and the parking lot is emptier since tariffs tensions began.
Barbara Barett, the executive director of Frontier Duty Free Association, says some of the 32 land-border duty frees in Canada have seen as much as an 80% decrease in sales since Trump's return to the White House. Most stores have seeing a 50-60% drop in business.
""We're 100% reliant on the travel across the border,"" she says of duty frees. ""Our stores are often pillars of these communities - communities depend on them.""
Billboard in Port Huron, Michigan
And while the crossing at Port Huron-Sarnia is faring better than most, on a Friday in May the parking lot of the Sarnia Duty Free is almost empty.
Tania Lee, who runs the store with her family, says that has become the new norm.
On Easter weekend - usually one of their busiest of the year, as Canadians take advantage of the break to stop in at a favourite restaurant and go to a church service in Port Huron  - cars were few and far between, and sales were not what they should have been, she says.
""We are suffering because of collateral damage at the border,"" Ms Lee says of her second-generation family business.
She notes that people who live in border towns often cross the boundary multiple times a week. Ms Lee, for example, has a mailbox at a shipping facility in Port Huron that she visits regularly, as do her neighbours.
Port Huron Mayor Anita Ashford in front of Blue Water Bridge which connects Port Huron, Michigan, and Sarnia, Ontario
People across the Blue Water Bridge are feeling the effects too, Mayor Anita Ashford says.
She has heard from both residents of her town and Canadians frustrated about the increased tension between the nations.
Nationally, a 10% drop in Canadian tourism would cost the US up to 14,000 jobs and $2.1bn (Â£1.56bn) in business, according to the US Travel Association.
Michigan is one of the places likely to see the brunt of that impact. In 2023, Canadian visitors spent a collective $238m in the state, according to tourism officials.
That money is essential for border towns like Port Huron, its mayor says.
""I hope people in Washington will start to understand what they're doing to the people,"" she says. ""We are not responsible for this, the [federal] government put us in this position and now we have to deal with it respectfully.""
""We need each other,"" she says."

When Charlie Hopkins thinks back to the three years he spent in one of America's most famous prisons, he remembers the ""deathly quiet"" the most.
In 1955, Hopkins was sent to Alcatraz - a famed prison on an isolated island off the coast of San Francisco - after causing trouble at other prisons to serve a 17-year sentence for kidnapping and robbery.
Falling asleep at night in his cell on the remote island, he said, the only sound was the whistle of ships passing.
""That's a lonely sound,"" Hopkins said. ""It reminds you of Hank Williams singing that song, 'I'm so lonesome I could cry.'""
Now 93 and living in Florida, Hopkins said the San Francisco National Archives informed him that he is likely the last surviving former Alcatraz inmate. Another former inmate, William Baker, appeared to be alive as of last year. 
In an interview with the BBC this week, Hopkins described life at Alcatraz - which formed the setting for the 1996 film The Rock - where he made friends with gangsters and once helped plan an unsuccessful escape. 
Although it closed decades ago, US President Donald Trump recently claimed that he wants to re-open it as a federal prison. 
When Hopkins was transferred to the high-security prison in 1955, from an Atlanta facility, he remembers it being clean, but barren. And there were few distractions - no radio at the time, and few books, he said.
""There was nothing to do,"" he said. ""You could walk back and forth in your cell or do push-ups.""
Hopkins kept busy part of the time with his job cleaning Alcatraz, sweeping the floors and buffing them ""until they shined"", he said.
He was sent to prison in 1952 in Jacksonville, Florida, for his role in a series of robberies and kidnappings. He was part of a group that took hostages to get through roadblocks and steal cars, he said. 
The men who broke out of Alcatraz with a spoon
Charlie Hopkins spent three years in Alcatraz prison after causing trouble in other facilities 
At Alcatraz, Hopkins had some infamous neighbours. The facility housed many violent criminals over its 30 years - Al Capone; Robert Stroud, a murderer known as the ""Birdman of Alcatraz""; and crime boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger - making it the subject of a host of films and television shows.
A 22-acre island, 1.25 miles (2km) off San Francisco and surrounded by freezing waters with strong currents, Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort. It was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison. The US Justice Department took it over in the 1930s, transforming the facility into a federal prison to address rampant organised crime at the time.
Even in the high-security prison, Hopkins said he still managed to get into trouble and spent many days in the facility's ""D Block"" - solitary confinement where inmates who misbehaved were held and rarely let out of their cells. 
His longest stint there - six months - came after he tried to help several other prisoners, including notorious bank robber Forrest Tucker, escape Alcatraz, Hopkins said. He helped steal hacksaw blades from the prison's electric shop to cut the prison bars in the basement kitchen.
The plan didn't work - prison guards discovered the blades in other inmates' cells, Hopkins said. ""A few days after they locked them up, they locked me up,"" he said.
But that did not stop one of the inmates.
In 1956, when Tucker was taken to a hospital for a kidney operation, he stabbed his ankle with a pencil so prison guards would have to remove his leg irons, Tucker told the New Yorker, external. Then, as he was taken to get an X-ray, he overpowered hospital orderlies and ran away, he said. 
He was captured in a hospital gown in a cornfield hours later. 
As more prisoners attempted to escape Alcatraz over the years, officials ramped up security, Hopkins said. 
""When I left there in 1958, the security was so tight you couldn't breathe,"" he said.
All told, there were 14 separate attempts over the years involving 36 inmates, according to the National Park Service. 
One of the most famous involved Frank Morris, and brothers Clarence and John Anglin, who escaped in June 1962 by placing papier-mÃ¢chÃ© heads in their beds and breaking out through ventilation ducts. They were never found, but the FBI concluded that they drowned in the cold waters surrounding the island. 
A year later, the prison shut down after the government determined it would be more cost-effective to build new prisons than to keep the remote island facility in operation. 
Now it's a publicly run museum visited by millions each year that generates about $60m (Â£45m) a year in revenue for park partners.
The building is decrepit, with peeling paint, rusted pipes, and crumbling toilets in each cramped cell. Construction on the main prison facility began in 1907, and more than a century of exposure to the elements has rendered the place all but uninhabitable.
Trump said this week, however, that he wants his government to re-open and expand the island prison for the country's ""most ruthless and violent offenders"".
A tour group visits Alcatraz
Alcatraz ""represents something very strong, very powerful"" - law and order, Trump said.
But experts and historians said Trump's proposal to re-establish the prison is far-fetched, as it would cost billions to repair and bring up to date with other federal facilities.
Hopkins agrees. ""It would be so expensive,"" he said. 
""Back then, the sewage system went into the ocean,"" he added. ""They'd have to come up with another way of handling that.""
Hopkins left Alcatraz five years before it closed down for good. He had been transferred to a prison in Springfield, Missouri and given psychiatric medication that improved his behaviour and helped him heal psychological issues, he said. 
But the avid Trump supporter said he does not believe the president's proposal is serious. 
""He don't really want to open that place,"" Hopkins said, adding that Trump was trying to ""get a point across to the public"" about punishing criminals and those who enter the US illegally.
Hopkins was released in 1963, working first at a truck stop before taking on other jobs. He went back to his home state of Florida, where now he has a daughter and grandson. 
After several decades reflecting on his crimes and life in Alcatraz, he wrote a 1,000-page memoir, with nearly half of the book detailing his troubled behaviour, he said. 
""You wouldn't believe the trouble I caused them when I was there,"" he said. ""I can see now, looking back, that I had problems."""

Speaking to the BBC in Kyiv following a virtual meeting of the ""coalition of the willing"", the UK prime minister said ""we haven't seen unity like this pretty well throughout the conflict"".
Around 30 global leaders reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire from Monday, threatening ""massive"" sanctions if it does not comply.
Noting other conflicts including India-Pakistan hostilities, Sir Keir said ""we are living in a more uncertain world"" that ""requires leadership stepping up"".
The UK prime minister joined French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for the meeting, which was hosted by Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky.
Other members of the ""coalition of the willing"" participated remotely, including Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Canadian PM Mark Carney, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of Nato.
In a phone call with Donald Trump following the meeting, the US president reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire, after Vladimir Putin rejected his initial proposal in March.
Sir Keir said Trump was ""absolutely clear that this is a demand that must be met"".
The leaders assembled in Kyiv warned that ""new and massive"" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire ""in the air, at sea and on land"".
Sir Keir told the BBC that ""material progress"" had been made during the meeting.
""We've been able to collectively get to a much better position and a more unified position today that holds out a better prospect of a ceasefire,"" he said. 
""You've got unity in the demand, but also unity in what the response will be if the demand is not met. We haven't seen that sort of unity during this conflict.""
""I'm not going to pretend this is the end of the process but this is a significant moment we now need to push on and make sure this happens,"" he added.
Further coordinating sanctions on Russian oil, fossil fuels and other assets would make a ""material difference"", the prime minister said.
The Kremlin reacted to the proposal by accusing European leaders of making ""contradictory"" and ""generally confrontational"" remarks about Russia.
Press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that Ukraine's allies must stop sending weapons to Ukraine before any ceasefire can happen - something European leaders have rejected - before later saying Russia would consider the proposal.
""We have to think about this. This is a new development,"" state-run Russian news agency Tass reported Peskov as saying.
The Kyiv meeting was a symbolic show of support for Ukraine a day after more than 20 world leaders joined Putin in Moscow for Russia's World War Two Victory Day parade.
The massive military parade was held in Moscow's Red Square to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 with leaders including China's Xi Jinping, Brazil's  President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, an EU member, in attendance.
""It was a hugely important, symbolic day here in Kyiv because there was a propaganda exercise in Moscow yesterday,"" Sir Keir told the BBC.
""80 years on from VE Day it was really important that we were here today... to demonstrate that the values that underpinned what was being fought for 80 years ago are the same values now"".
Asked whether he feels ""scared about the state of the world"" as others in Britain do - given conflicts in the Middle East and India-Pakistan tensions - Sir Keir said ""we are living in a more uncertain world and we're in a different era of defence and security"".
But he said it did not keep him up at night ""because it's really important that I focus on what I can do - bringing people together, making significant steps today, making sure we're preparing with Ukraine for what might happen next"".
The so-called ""coalition of the willing"" was established by the UK and France to reinforce any eventual peace deal with security guarantees, including the presence of peacekeeping troops in Ukraine."

Top trade officials from both sides met on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January. 
Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%.
There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party. 
And yet this weekend they face each other over the negotiating table.  
So why now?
Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first. 
""Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,"" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator. 
""The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side.""
Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that ""the talks are being held at the request of the US"".  
And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the ""calls of US businesses and consumers"".
The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who ""want to do business very much"" because ""their economy is collapsing"".
""They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,"" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.
While Chinese trade officials head to Geneva, Xi Jinping is in Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin
But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: ""We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""It only matters what happens in that room.""
The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany. 
 Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader.
This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table.
Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to ""fight till the end""- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries. 
Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low.
The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US. 
""I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,"" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore. 
""So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'""
And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk.
On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years. 
And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company owner told the BBC that they were ""looking at the total implosion of the supply chain"".
Toys for sale in China's Yiwu, the world's biggest wholesale market - China sold $10bn worth of toys to the US last year
Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting.
American children may ""have two dolls instead of 30 dolls"", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, ""and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally"". 
Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs.
""Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,"" Mr Olson says. 
""A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose.""
While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise.
The talks will mostly be about ""touching base"", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an ""exchange of positions"" and, if things go well, ""an agenda [will be] set for future talks"".
The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term.
After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a ""phase one"" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not include thornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs. 
In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies.  
What could emerge this time is a ""phase one deal on steroids"", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, from the illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harder on to Beijing's relationship with Moscow. 
But all of that is far down the line, experts warn. 
""The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,"" Mr Olson adds.
""Geneva will only produce anodyne statements about 'frank dialogues' and the desire to keep talking."""

The US president's directive was issued on Friday and forms part of his administration's plan to incentivise undocumented immigrants to self-deport.
In a video, Trump said he was making it ""as easy as possible"" for them to leave the US.
The federal government will fund flights out of the US for undocumented people who choose to leave voluntarily and provide an ""exit bonus"", the executive order stated.
The president's call to increase staff comes as his administration pursues multiple pathways to force undocumented immigrants to leave the US.
His order on Friday did not specify how the increase in staffing at the DHS would be funded.
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the sub-agency that primarily deals with illegal immigration, currently has more than 21,000 employees.
Of those, it has 6,100 deportation officers and more than 750 enforcement removal assistants, according to the agency's website.
Trump has long called for local and state law enforcement, as well as the National Guard, to assist with border enforcement.
The order calls on the DHS to supplement its current efforts ""by deputising and contracting with state and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, officers and personnel within other federal agencies"".
Trump has called for individuals to self-deport, using a government app known as CPB Home. This week, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced $1,000 (Â£751) bonuses and paid travel for people who leave the US voluntarily.
Other deportation methods have been challenged or blocked federal courts, including Trump's use of the 18th Century Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants his administration accuses of gang activity.
Earlier this month, US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez, a Trump appointee in Texas, found that the administration's use of the act was ""unlawful."" A second federal judge in New York later reached the same conclusion.
Trump dubbed his self-deportation initiative as ""Project Homecoming"". 
He said: ""Illegal aliens who stay in America face punishments, including significant jail time, enormous financial penalties confiscation of all property garnishment of all wages, imprisonment, and incarceration and sudden deportation, in a place, and manner, solely of our discretion."""

Thousands of people have celebrated Polish food and culture during the annual Polish Heritage Day.
Organisers said the event had become a huge date in Gloucester's calendar since it began in 2017.
Speaking to BBC Radio Gloucestershire, Mr Silarski said the heritage day had always been about bringing people together.
He said: ""We wanted to do something to show our culture, to introduce ourselves to British people, and show we weren't here to grab their jobs but give something back as well.""
This year's festival included a headline band from Poland, as well as Polish food and drink.
Marcin Silarski, chairman of Polish Association Gloucester, said: ""It's a great atmosphere, everything going as we want it, it's really good.""
Tom Hennessey, Ola Bladyko and Agnieszka Bladyko celebrated their heritage
For Ola Bladyko, who has lived in Gloucester for 20 years, the day was a chance to revisit and celebrate her heritage.
She said: ""It's so nice to feel at home.
""Ever since they started doing it in the park everything is just so beautiful, you feel like you're back in Poland.""
Alicia Hainrych and Mike Meredith attend the event every year
Alicia Hainrych is originally from Poland while partner Mike Meredith was born and grew up in Cheltenham.
She said: ""The sun is shining, the atmosphere is good, and everyone is very friendly.""
Their daughter Maya, who Alicia said describes herself as ""half and half"", was also somewhere enjoying the day.
""She's off somewhere looking at the stalls, probably spending lots of money.""
BBC Radio Gloucestershire's Breakfast Presenter Jon Smith hosted with Natasza Tyka
The day was hosted by Natasza Tyka from Gloucester who returned for another year, along with BBC Radio Gloucestershire's Breakfast Presenter, Jon Smith.
Ms Tyka said: ""Every year it gets bigger and bigger.
""It's full of energy but it's also a really nice family day with lots of people bringing blankets, trying different food, enjoying the Polish music and culture.""

His family have said they cannot claim for the cost of his care as his travel insurance had expired two days before - so friends held a fundraising event at Lost Horizon in Bristol on Saturday.

Donald Trump's administration is ""actively looking at"" suspending habeas corpus - the right of a person to challenge their detention in court - one of the US president's top aides has said.
Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, told reporters on Friday that the US Constitution allowed for the legal liberty to be suspended in times of ""rebellion or invasion"".
His comments come as judges have sought to challenge some recent detentions made by the Trump administration in an effort to combat illegal immigration, as well as remove dissenting foreign students.
""A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,"" Miller said. 
There are several pending civil cases against the Trump administration's deportation of undocumented migrants based on habeaus corpus.  
Most recently, a federal judge ordered the release of a Turkish university student who had been detained for six weeks after writing an article that was critical of Israel.
Last week, another judge ordered a Columbia University student detained over his advocacy for Palestinians be released after a petition on habeas corpus grounds.
However, other judges have sided with the Trump administration in such disputes.
Miller described habeas corpus as a ""privilege"", and said Congress had already passed a law stripping judicial courts of jurisdiction over immigration cases.
Legal experts and critics have questioned the veracity of his interpretation of US law.
""Congress has the authority to suspend habeas corpus - not Stephen Miller, not the president,"" Marc Elias, an attorney for the Democratic Party, told MSNBC. 
One of Trump's key campaign pledges was to deport millions of immigrants from the US, and his administration has pursued different means of expediting deportations since returning to the White House. 
In March, a federal judge's order prevented the Trump administration from invoking a centuries-old wartime law to justify deporting more than 200 Venezuelans, despite the flights going ahead.
But deportations have lagged behind detentions - while one person has been deported erroneously.
Trump's first 100 days in office
CNN reported, citing unnamed sources, that Trump was personally involved in the discussions around suspending habeas corpus.
Trump himself has not mentioned the suspension of habeas corpus, but has said he would take steps to combat injunctions against his actions on deportation. 
Listen: The President's Path: Doubling Down on Deportations
""There are ways to mitigate it and there's some very strong ways,"" he said in April. 
""There's one way that's been used by three very highly respected presidents, but we hope we don't have to go that route.""
Habeas corpus - which literally means ""you should have the body"" - allows for a person to be brought before a judge so the legality of their detention can be decided by a judge.
The legal right has been suspended four times in US history: during the American Civil War under Abraham Lincoln, in Hawaii following the 1941 Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbour, in the Philippines during US ownership in 1905, and while combat the activities of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan group in the 19th Century.
The section of the US Constitution which includes the suspension of habeas corpus grants its powers to Congress and not the president."

""Surrey is a prime parakeet county,"" says Oliver Fry from the Surrey Wildlife Trust. 
Standing in Meadowbank Park in Dorking, he tells Secret Surrey the bright green birds like tall trees, munching on blossom and drinking out of ponds. 
They are often heard before they are seen as they have ""very loud, shrill voices"" and ""argue quite a lot"", Mr Fry explains.
But why are there so many parakeets in Surrey, and where did they come from?
Mr Fry says many popular myths surround how parakeets - an invasive species - arrived in the UK. 
His favourite is that US guitarist Jimi Hendrix released them on Carnaby Street in London near the end of the 1960s. 
""It is lovely to think of him giving these exotic creatures their first taste of Britain."" 
Going back further, the wildlife expert says another urban legend is that parakeets were brought onto the set of the 1951 film The African Queen and escaped. 
But the truth behind their arrival in the UK, according to him, is that they were imported from India and Pakistan as pets.  
""Many people who bought them relatively cheaply in those days got fed up with them and let them go,"" he tells BBC Radio Surrey. 
""The hardiest ones managed to eke out a living. Now they are thriving here."" 
Mr Fry says parakeet imports were at their height in the 1970s and 80s, when large numbers of wild birds started to be shipped commercially by air.
But the non-migratory species was brought in by boat before that and there are records of parakeets living in the wild during Victorian times.
DNA research, external by the University of Kent has traced the majority of British parakeets back to populations from Pakistan and northern parts of India.
Mr Fry says the parakeet trade boomed because they were easy to catch, transport and sell. 
But the bird was a ""rip off"", he continues. ""They generally don't like to be kept in cages, they don't tame down very easily and are noisy."" 
Surreyâs emerald invaders
Though he himself likes them, Mr Fry says the species is controversial for both the public and conservationists. 
""Not everyone loves them. They are very brash, colourful, domineering creatures. 
""That obviously is going to divide opinion.""

""Whatever I was doing - maybe cleaning up or doing homework - when I heard the 'oooh-oooh-oooooh',"" Adesoji Kukoyi says, mimicking the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, ""I dropped everything and ran straight to the television.""
As a child growing up in 1980s Nigeria, Mr Kukoyi was infatuated with sci-fi sensation Doctor Who. British shows like Allo Allo and Fawlty Towers aired regularly as a cultural hangover from the colonial era, but none captured Mr Kukoyi's imagination like the time-travelling Doctor did.
""He always spoke to me,"" 44-year-old Mr Kukoyi, who currently has a vintage Doctor Who theme as the ringtone on his phone, tells the BBC. 
""Like there's somebody watching out for us... yes, we make mistakes, but we do our best, especially if we have a teacher that will lead us on the right path.""
Mr Kukoyi has been watching Doctor Who for decades, so when he heard that on Saturday an episode will, for the very first time, be set in Nigeria, he was elated.
""I was watching last week's episode with my wife and the preview [for the following week] said: 'Welcome to Lagos, Nigeria'. I screamed like a little girl!"" Mr Kukoyi says. 
The setting is momentous not just for Mr Kukoyi - a native of Nigeria's biggest and liveliest city Lagos - but for the show too. Saturday's adventure will be the first primarily set in Africa.
It is fitting that the producers chose Nigeria for this milestone - in 2013, fans worldwide were delighted when nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility.
Adesoji Kukoyi has been watching Doctor Who since he was a child
Ariyon Bakare, who in the upcoming episode plays the mysterious Barber, says fans can expect ""a time-bending cultural ancestral collision"" and ""hair, lots of hair"".
The preview also teases a vibrant barber shop, a brimming Lagos market and a towering, monstrous-looking spider. 
Fans speculate that this creature is Anansi, a legendary character in West African and Caribbean folktales, but scriptwriter Inua Ellams is keeping specifics under wraps.
As for why the show has enjoyed such popularity in Nigeria, he says: ""There's something Nigerian about the Doctor. Nigerians are sort of loud, gregarious people... the Doctor is mysterious, boisterous, sort of over-confident but somehow manages to save the day.""
Ellams, who moved from Nigeria to the UK as a child, also considers why in 62 years, a character known to traverse the universe has barely spent any time in Africa.
It could be that no writer has felt confident enough to produce an authentic African story, he says, or it might be down to the Doctor's need to ""blend into his environment and be inconspicuous"".
""Ncuti Gatwa [who plays the Doctor] being an actor of African descent means that we can tell new stories with the Doctor and negotiate in different spaces because of his appearance. 
""And this is the brilliance of the show - every Doctor creates new opportunities to tell new stories in different ways,"" Ellams tells the BBC.
Ariyon Bakare (left) plays the Barber in what he calls a ""cultural ancestral collision""
But these fresh Doctor Who stories have a smaller reach than the old ones did, as the show is no longer broadcast on Nigerian public TV. If you are in the country and want to catch up on the Doctor's exploits, you would have to subscribe to streaming service Disney Plus.
Regardless, Mr Kukoyi insists that a dedicated troop of Nigerian Doctor Who lovers will be sitting transfixed on their sofas on Saturday evening, bearing witness to the Tardis materialising in Lagos.
""I'm waiting with baited breath,"" he says. ""Finally, he is coming!""
Mr Kukoyi - whose first experience of the Doctor was one played by a stripy scarf-wearing Tom Baker - says his young daughters are not so taken with his beloved show.
He is ""trying to get them onboard"", he says. 
Perhaps seeing the Doctor wearing traditional Nigerian clothing, squeezing his way through a quintessential Lagos market and getting caught up in local folklore will help them fall in love with the show the way their father once did.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Ukraine where he will join fellow world leaders to put pressure on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire in the war.
Sir Keir travelled by train with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Friedrich Merz, who is making his first trip to Ukraine since becoming Germany's chancellor this week.
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is joining them in Kyiv. It is Sir Keir's second visit to Ukraine as prime minister.
He and the other leaders are using the visit to urge Russia to ""agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire"" - a proposal initially made by US President Donald Trump.
The leaders' decision to travel to Kyiv together is a deliberately symbolic response to the more than 20 leaders who joined President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for Russia's Victory Day commemorations on Friday.
The leaders also vowed to ""ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine"".
On Saturday morning, they visited Kyiv's Independence Square to pay their respects to the Ukrainian soldiers killed in action since Russia's full-scale invasion began more than three years ago.
The four leaders will join President Volodymyr Zelensky for a virtual meeting of the ""coalition of the willing"" - the group of around 30 mainly European nations seeking ways to entrench Ukraine's security if a peace deal with Russia is agreed.
In a statement released before their arrival, the leaders said: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom will stand in Kyiv in solidarity with Ukraine against Russia's barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion.
""We reiterate our backing for President Trump's calls for a peace deal and call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace.
""Alongside the US, we call on Russia to agree a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace.
""We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal.
""We are clear the bloodshed must end, Russia must stop its illegal invasion, and Ukraine must be able to prosper as a safe, secure and sovereign nation within its internationally recognised borders for generations to come.
""We will continue to increase our support for Ukraine. Until Russia agrees to an enduring ceasefire, we will ratchet up pressure on Russia's war machine.""
Russia announced it would mark World War Two Victory Day with a unilateral, three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine rejected as a ""theatrical show"".
Kyiv has described the truce as a farce, accusing Russia of launching thousands of attacks since it came into force at midnight on Wednesday. Russia says it has observed the ceasefire and accuses Ukraine of hundreds of violations.
German Chancellor Merz said he had high hopes that a full ceasefire could be agreed as soon as this weekend.
Russia's three-day truce is set to end on Saturday night, but Merz said it could be extended to 30 days and the ""ball is now entirely in Moscow's court"".
Trump reiterated the call for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire after a phone call with Zelensky.
""If the ceasefire is not respected, the US and its partners will impose further sanctions,"" Trump posted on Truth Social."

An author has recounted how he risked torture to smuggle literature into South Africa that helped campaign against Apartheid.
The racist political system which governed South African life from 1948 to 1991 ensured privilege for white South Africans and saw the black population treated extremely harshly.
Ken Keable, from Stoke-sub-Hamdon in Somerset, was recruited to campaign on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC) and said: ""The racism there was so hideous and so unjust, it couldn't last.""
The book he wrote about his campaign has now been adapted into a film that is being screened in cinemas around the country.
Mr Keable was recruited by members of the Communist Party in London, who were working with the ANC to find people who would not arouse suspicion.
""I was approached by the London secretary when I was 23 and he said 'are you prepared to do something illegal?',"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.
""I was a bit surprised, but I said yes and we had a cautious conversation about it, and I was asked to go to South Africa and do some things.""
In 1968, Mr Keable smuggled 1,200 letters addressed to the Indian community into the country, using a suitcase with a false bottom.
Once inside South Africa, he posted the letters so they appeared to come from inside the country.
There was widespread racial segregation under the Apartheid era in South Africa
His second mission, in 1970, involved a visit to Durban, where he set up several devices called leaflet bombs, which were timed to send hundreds of leaflets showering into the sky. 
""At the same time, we set up loudspeaker broadcasts in the street, which were timed to go off at the same time as the leaflet bombs. 
""We didn't know at the time it was being done at five cities simultaneously, and it made headlines in South Africa.
""Despite Nelson Mandela being in jail, the ANC was still alive and kicking and it made an impact,"" Mr Keable said.
Mr Keable said he was told what might happen if he was caught, and that he would be tortured.
""I wasn't afraid. It was a brilliant idea to recruit people like me who were able to do this work. 
""The authorities were on the lookout for ANC people re-entering the country, they weren't going to be looking out for white people like me with no connection to South Africa who weren't known to the authorities.
""It was just obvious in the way people behaved towards each other that it was an unjust society,"" he said.
In 2012, Mr Keable wrote a book about his campaign, entitled London Recruits. The recent film adaptation has already been screened in several independent cinemas. 
""There's a lot of racism around these days and politicians are using racism to meet their ends so it's always topical,"" he said.
""Our activities showed that ordinary people can make a difference, they can take part and change the course of history.""

When a fire ripped through part of the Doagh Famine Village in Donegal last Saturday, owner Pat Doherty said he was ""devastated"" and considered ""giving up on it all"".
But after an outpouring of community support, donations and volunteering, work is underway to rebuild and restore one of Donegal's most popular tourist attractions. 
The fire, which broke out last Saturday was put out and foul play is not suspected.
The original Doagh Famine Village tells the story of an Irish family living through famine times up until the present day.
Until 1984, Mr Doherty lived with his family in one of the thatched dwellings, which is now on display, and he decided to make it a tourist attraction in 1997. 
Mr Doherty hopes he can reopen the family-run business by the end of the summer
Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Doherty said the fire started ""way beyond the famine village, in an outbuilding, where it seems a compressor machine had overheated"". 
Due to dry weather and a strong wind, the fire spread quickly to the newer extension to the attraction. 
While most of the village is to do with the famine, ""we had another part which was to do with the Peace Process and the Traveller community"", those were the parts destroyed by the fire. 
However the original part of the village is intact. 
Donegal County Fire Service said Fire Brigades from Buncrana, Carndonagh and Moville attended the incident
Mr Doherty said many things which were destroyed are now ""lost to history"". 
""We had an original gypsy wagon, that belonged to a family from Letterkenny which cannot be replaced, ever.""
There was an Orange Hall that was constructed as part of the attraction which ""many lodges from all over Northern Ireland had donated to because they wanted their stories told"". 
Despite the irreparable damage caused, Mr Doherty said the power of the community and good will has spurred him to rebuild. 
""We will have to rebuild and hope that we can get the stories back, and it might be a bit different, but maybe better the second time round,"" he added.
""The people who helped us before, the Orange Order, and the republican side too, they are still there, and they want their stories told here.
""Its all for peace - I have not met a loyalist or a republican who doesn't want the world to be a better place,"" he added. 
Mr Doherty explained that when the fire was finally brought under control, ""it was devastation"" that was left
A construction company has volunteered to clear the damaged area of the site so the rebuild can begin, and Mr Doherty hopes he can reopen the family-run business by the end of the summer. 
Mr Doherty described it as ""strange, in a good way"", the degree of goodwill that has poured in from the people and businesses of Donegal. 
A nearby visitor attraction called Wild Alpaca Way began a crowd funder which raised most of its â¬100k (Â£84,000) target within a few days. 
""One lad who had his 17th birthday gave most of his birthday money as a donation, it's very strange. 
""A wee local shop donated â¬2,000 (Â£1,692) of its earnings,"" he added. 
Another outdoor tourist attraction from Donegal presented Mr Doherty with a â¬10,000 (Â£8,462) cheque earlier in the week. 
""We depend on other places, one attraction depends on another in Donegal, they all work together,"" he added. 
A thatched cottage at Doagh Famine Village in County Donegal
Because many of the structures in the attraction featured traditional thatched rooves, Mr Doherty said the insurance does not cover fire damage.  
Donegal County Fire Service said Fire Brigades from Buncrana, Carndonagh and Moville had attended the incident.
""Although a number of important exhibits were lost in the fire, the thatched cottages and other key buildings were protected from the fire,"" a spokesperson said.
Brigades remained at the scene until after 21:00 local time on the evening of the incident.
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) also assisted and said a technical examination of the scene has been completed."

A massive increase in the price of water is just one consequence of a week of aerial attacks on the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.
Once seen as a relatively safe haven from Sudan's devastating civil war, Port Sudan is now reeling from days of bombardment from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.
After six days of drone attacks, smoke is still rising from three fuel depots which were targeted. Rescue teams are gathered around the destroyed sites, but they are struggling to put the fires out.
The conflict, which began as a struggle between the leaders of the RSF and the army more than two years ago, has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and forced more than 12 million people from their homes.
One of those who fled to Port Sudan is 26-year-old Mutasim, who did not want his second name published for safety reasons.
The BBC spoke to him after he had waited hours for a water vendor to turn up.
The vital commodity has become scarce. The explosions at the fuel depots have left Port Sudan without the diesel used to power the pumps that bring up the groundwater.

How war devastated Sudan's museums
Mutasim told the BBC that whereas a day's supply of water cost him 2,000 Sudanese pounds ($3.30; Â£2.50) a week ago, he is now being charged five times that amount.
It leaves him and the seven other members of his family without much water for cooking, cleaning and bathing.
""Soon, we won't be able to afford it,"" he said explaining that he gets money from buying and selling basic goods in the market.
Water is not the only challenge in Port Sudan.
Daily life is going back to normal, markets and shops are open, but there are crowds of cars outside the city's petrol stations as people desperately wait for fuel.
""It could take me five hours to get petrol,"" said Mutasim.
It is a situation that many Sudanese have faced before, but not in this city.
Before the recent attacks, people were able to go out at night in Port Sudan to enjoy themselves
Until last week, Port Sudan was one of the few places in the country that was considered protected from the worst of the civil war.
""We came here two years ago from Omdurman,"" Mutasim said, referring to the city that sits on the other side of the River Nile from the capital, Khartoum.
It cost the family their entire savings - $3,000 (Â£2,250) â to set up in a new place.
""We were forced to leave our home by the RSF, so it was a relief to come here. Life was starting to go back to normal.""
""We were thinking about moving because it is no longer safe here, but it's so expensive - and where do we go?""
Port Sudan has been experiencing blackouts for the past two weeks, which have been made worse by the latest attacks.
""My auntie is over 70 years old, she is struggling with the heat and humidity because there is no electricity for fans at night,"" Mutasim said.
""We can't sleep.""
Hawa Mustafa is unsure what she will do next after Port Sudan was hit by the drone attacks
Hawa Mustafa, a teacher from el-Geneina in Darfur, in the west of the country, also sought refuge in Port Sudan.
She has been living with her four children in a shelter for displaced people for over two years. She said this week's attacks left her ""living in fear"".
""The drones came to us and we returned to a state of war and the lack of safety,"" she told the BBC.
""The sounds of the drones and the anti-aircraft missiles remind me of the first days of the war in el-Geneina.""
Hawa lives without her husband, who has been unable to leave their home due to the deteriorating security situation. She is now responsible for her family.
""I don't know where to go if things get worse in Port Sudan. I was planning to go to one of the neighbouring countries, but it seems that this dream will no longer come true.""
Another person living in the city, Mariam Atta, told the BBC that ""life has changed completely"".
""We are struggling to cope,"" she said. ""The fear is constant.""
People living in Port Sudan's camps get help from aid agencies which use the city as a distribution hub 
Since Sudan's civil war started in 2023, humanitarian agencies have depended on Port Sudan as a gateway to bring in aid, because of its port and the country's only functional international airport.
It has been used by organisations such as the UN's World Food Programme to deliver food assistance.
""Port Sudan is our main humanitarian hub,"" says Leni Kinzli, WFP spokesperson for Sudan.
""In March, we had almost 20,000 metric tonnes of food distributed, and I would say definitely more than half of that came through Port Sudan,"" she told the BBC.
The WFP has said that there is currently famine in 10 regions of the country, with 17 more at risk.
Many aid agencies are now concerned these attacks could block the flow of aid, making the humanitarian situation even worse.
""I think this is going to severely constrain the delivery of life-saving food and medical supplies, which will risk further deterioration of the already critical situation,"" Shashwat Saraf, country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC.
He added that while agencies will look for other routes into the country, it will be challenging.
At night the city is quiet.
Before the attacks, people would gather at the coast and some would watch football in local cafes. But the electricity blackout has left the city in the dark and residents are choosing to stay at home for security reasons.

545,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8d1pngdjzmo,2025-05-10 04:07:35,"Families of Hamas-held hostages tell of growing concern for their fate,","Twin brothers Gali and Ziv Berman are still being held in Gaza
Families of Israeli hostages taken to Gaza in the 7 October attacks have expressed their increasing concern about the fates of loved ones, as doubts grow about how many are still alive.
One family said the hostages were at risk ""every day"" they continued to be held captive by Hamas.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this week there was ""uncertainty"" over the condition of three of the 24 hostages previously believed to be alive.
He was reacting to US President Donald Trump's statement on Tuesday that only 21 of those taken in the Hamas-led attacks were still alive.
The BBC spoke to two families - including the brother of a hostage released by Hamas this year - after Israel's security cabinet approved an expanded offensive in Gaza.
Netanyahu said ministers had decided on a ""forceful operation"" to destroy Hamas and rescue the hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population ""will be moved, to protect it"".
One family told the BBC they hoped the troops would only be used to help with the aim of freeing the hostages, not for any other reasons.
Liran Berman's twin brothers Gali and Ziv have been held by Hamas for 19 months after they were kidnapped from their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October 2023.
About 1,200 people were killed by Hamas-led gunmen that day, while Gali and Ziv were among 251 others who were taken hostage.
More than 52,780 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Israel cut off all deliveries of aid and other supplies on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after it broke a two-month ceasefire that saw 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages released in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Following news of Israel's plan to expand its military operation in Gaza using thousands more troops unless Hamas agreed a new ceasefire and released the remaining hostages, Liran Berman told BBC News: ""I hope that Israel is sending the forces to put pressure on Hamas to sit down.
""When Hamas was feeling threatened, they did the deals. I hope they are not sending the troops to conquer or for revenge.""
Liran Berman says he worries about his two brothers' mental condition
Mr Berman said his 27-year-old brothers were ""at risk every single day"".
""We know they are alive. The released hostages saw them.""
He said he believed Gali and Ziv had been injured when they were seized but that he worried their mental condition was ""not good"" after so long in captivity.
With the release of emaciated and frail hostages in February, Mr Berman said he was worried about his brothers' conditions.
""We need to pressure Hamas and its enablers.""
Or Levy was painfully thin when he was released
For 491 days, Or Levy was held by Hamas not knowing whether his wife Einav had survived the 7 October attack on the Nova music festival where he was taken.
She didn't and for more than a year his three-year-old son Almog was without both his parents. In February, Or, weak and painfully thin, was released by Hamas.
His brother, Michael Levy, told BBC News he was worried about the impact on the hostages if Israel sent more troops into Gaza.
""I'm concerned it will affect the hostages, that the terrorists can decide to do something to them,"" he said. ""I do believe the army knows what it's doing and they will make sure the hostages aren't affected, but it's always a concern.""
But he said he wanted more pressure applied to get them released.
""There is a crime against humanity and everyone including President Trump needs to do more in order to bring them back.""
He said his brother did not receive enough food while he was held hostage in Hamas's underground tunnels in Gaza and ""didn't see sunlight"". He said he showered ""every two months or so"".
""My brother worries about the fact the rest of the hostages will end up dying in captivity because that was his worst fear about himself and it's now his worst fear about those he left behind.""
Of the 251 people taken hostage on 7 October - and the four other captives held by Hamas for around a decade before the attacks - 59 now remain in Gaza.
The Israeli government has publicly confirmed the deaths of 35, leaving 24 hostages. There is now uncertainty about the fate of three of them.
All 59 were kidnapped in the 7 October attack apart from one - the soldier Hadar Goldin who was killed in combat in Gaza during a previous war in 2014.
The living hostages are men in their 20s or 30s, apart from Omri Miran who turned 48 in April.
Of the 35 whose bodies Israel has confirmed are being held in Gaza, nearly all are men who were between 19 and 86 years old when they died. Three are women.
Gunmen handed Tal Shoham to the Red Cross in February
Since the spate of releases earlier this year, former hostages have been speaking to the media and others about their time in captivity. 
Tal Shoham, 49, released in February after 505 days, told a UN event last month: ""There were many times that we received just one pita bread for an entire dayâ¦ Traumatised by hunger, we collected crumb after crumb.""
Eliya Cohen was released in February after 505 days
Eliya Cohen, 28, who was also held for 505 days, told Israel's Channel 12 that once a week Hamas gunmen would make him and other hostages take off all their clothes and would tell them: ""You you're not quite there, you're not thin enough... I'm thinking about cutting the food even more.""
Ilana Gritzewsky's partner Matan remains a hostage
Ilana Gritzewsky was released during another ceasefire in November 2023. Her partner Matan Zangauker is still a hostage. 
The 31-year-old told the New York Times in March that as she was kidnapped from her home she was molested by one of the kidnappers. 
The article says she believes she was also sexually assaulted in Gaza. ""When she came to, she said, she found herself on the floor in a dilapidated building, clearly in Gaza, her shirt up baring her breasts and pants pulled down, with seven gunmen standing over her.""
Ron Krivoi, a sound engineer, was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. 
Last month, The Times of Israel quoted a Channel 12 interview in which he described the tunnels.
""We were inside a very, very small cageâ¦ and we had to lie down and rest in it â you couldn't stand. No height, no toilets, no food. We were five people."""

Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, ""freaked out"".
US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (Â£601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.
It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.
Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.
But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.
US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.
With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.
""I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,"" she says.
Use of rules known as ""de minimis"", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.
Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.
By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.
Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.
Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.
Trump recently called de minimis a ""scam"", brushing off concerns about higher costs. ""Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,"" he said.
However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.
Krystal DuFrene believes it's the consumer who ends up paying the tariff
Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.
Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.
""I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,"" she says. ""Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.""
When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by ""locally based sellers"", with orders fulfilled from within the US.
Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.
""It does kind of feel like the end of an era,"" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.
Gee Davis and her roommate used Temu to get new kitchen organisers as they moved house
She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a ""money grab"" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.
""I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.
""It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.""
As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.
The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.
Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant ""on paper"", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.
She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.
""Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,"" she says.
Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.
Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.
Custom suit company Indochino has said changes to de minimis pose a ""significant threat"" to its viability
Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.
Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.
""If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,"" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.
""But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.""
In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a ""significant threat to the viability"" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.
Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.
His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.
He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects ""thousands"" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.
""We want more time,"" he says. ""The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust."""

Rohit Sharma's abrupt retirement from Test cricket has jolted Indian fans, leaving the team without its captain and most seasoned opener just weeks before a pivotal five-Test series starts in England.
India haven't won a Test rubber in England since 2007. To lose their captain and most experienced opening batter will compel a rethink of selection strategy for the tour.
A charismatic leader and dashing batter, Sharma is widely regarded as a modern day great. 
His stats in Test cricket â 4,301 runs in 67 matches at an average of 40.57 are not imposing. 
But the aplomb and authority, tactical acumen and lead-from-the-front derring-do which he has displayed has won him admiration and respect all over the cricket world.
Sharma's decision to retire from Test cricket, announced via a subdued Instagram post, has sparked widespread speculation. While various factors may have influenced his choice, his prolonged slump in Test form appears to be the primary catalyst.
In his last six Tests - three against New Zealand at home, three against Australia Down Under - Sharma's form was woeful. In 10 innings in these matches, he could muster a paltry 122 runs.
To compound the problem, India lost all these Tests. Being whitewashed by New Zealand 3-0 at home - unprecedented in Indian cricket - put Sharma under harsh scrutiny in the ensuing Border-Gavaskar series in which too he found no relief. He took the laudable, but extreme step of dropping himself from the playing XI for the last Test at Sydney.
Kuldeep Yadav celebrates with Sharma after taking the wicket of England's Ben Duckett in 2024
Since then, India won the ODI Champions Trophy in which Sharma's form was impressive. 
The first few weeks of the ongoing IPL were disappointing but Sharma rediscovered his touch, playing important knocks to put his team Mumbai Indians strongly in the running for a place in the knockouts. But success in white-ball cricket is not necessarily an index to similar form being replicated in red-ball cricket.
Sharma is 38. His recent Test form has been ungratifying. The next World Test Championship cycle would take two years to complete. Did he have the physical wherewithal, the mental bandwidth, motivation and mojo to continue playing Test cricket? Questions he likely asked himself before calling it quits.
Sharma was the first among a clutch of talented batters emerging from the Under-19 pipeline in the first decade of this century. 
The others were Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane. These four were to take over the mantle of India's batting responsibility from Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Saurav Ganguly and Virender Sehwag.
Ironically, while Sharma got the India cap first, in an ODI against Ireland in 2007, he was the last among this quartet to play Test cricket.
He was part of MS Dhoni's team which won the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, but a Test place, which came relatively easily to Kohli, Pujara, Dhawan and Rahane, eluded him until Tendulkar's farewell series in 2013.
Sharma's skill often raised batsmanship to an art form
On debut at the Eden Gardens, Sharma made 177. In Tendulkar's swan song next match at the Wankhede, he made 111. These centuries were obscured by the overflowing of sentiment for Tendulkar, but Sharma's sublime skills, which often raised batsmanship to an art form, was not lost on experts.
Ravi Shastri, who was to have a huge influence on his Test career later by making him opener, likened him to a ""Swiss Watch"" for the precision timing in his strokeplay. Dilip Vengsarkar, former India captain who spotted him for India, highlights his ability to play late which helps in judging length of the ball quicker and better and also enables improvisation.
The style and finesse which made the likes of VVS Laxman and Mark Waugh so wonderful to watch were manifest in Sharma's batting from his earliest days as Test player.
Weaned on the ""Bombay School'' of batting which boasts exemplars of orthodox technique like Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, Sharma's batting carries that strain. 
But growing up in a post-modern milieu when risk-taking has become fundamental to batting in every format, Sharma shifted into higher gears far quicker, often from the start in Tests too once he was secure of his place.
He did not exhibit the bravado of a Sehwag, but when in full flow, he has often shown up the destructive ability of Viv Richards, especially when playing horizontal bat shots like hook, pull and cut.

Sharma scored 40,302 runs in 67 Test matches at an average hovering around 40
It was not until 2019, when the then chief coach Ravi Shastri and captain Virat Kohli coaxed and cajoled him to open the innings that Sharma's career in red-ball cricket bloomed.
By this time, he had smashed three ODI double centuries â apart from a spate of match-winning scores in T20 - establishing him as a Goliath in white-ball cricket.
When he became India captain in 2021, Sharma set his sights on bagging a hat-trick of ICC trophies, and recast the team's playing strategy for each format accordingly.
A genial, fun-loving bearing, marked by endearing earthiness helped him bond with his players easily and strongly. But he was no lax or loose on the field. He was astute, perceptive, intuitive in reading match situations, and particularly good in handling bowlers.
Five IPL titles for Mumbai Indians bespoke his leadership credentials even before he got the job for the national team.
Sharma (left) with Jasprit Bumrah - the captain was adept in handling bowlers
Under Sharma, India reached the World Test Championship final in 2023, only to lose to Australia. 
In the ODI World Cup the same year, his blazing batting as opener, and his strategy of ""total attack"" in which the batsmen would go after runs unrelentingly, took India into to the final where their dreams were dashed by an inspired Australian side. Winning the T20 World Cup a few months later, was some recompense, but not complete redemption.
It is pertinent that Sharma, who quit T20 cricket after winning the World Cup last year, hasn't retired from ODI cricket yet.
Not being part of an ODI World Cup winning team has been festering in him since 2011 when he was not selected in the squad under Dhoni that was to bring India glory after 28 years.
In an interview with podcaster Vimal Kumar released a few days back, he said that his desire to be part of an ODI World Cup winning team remains alive.
The next ODI World Cup is in 2027. Whether Sharma can sustain fitness and form over the two years will be followed with interest in the cricket world. 
But that is hardly the concern of India's selectors. Right now, their worry is to find an opener and a captain to step into Sharma's big boots."

Catholicism has rarely been more prominent in US politics as the Trump administration openly embraces advisers and officials who proudly say faith has shaped their views.
But any jubilation on the American Make America Great Again right about the new Pope this week quickly dissipated as key voices from Donald Trump's Maga movement came to a disappointed conclusion: the first American Pope does not appear to be ""America first"".
Little is known about the political leanings of Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago. 
He has voiced concerns for the poor and immigrants, chosen a name that may reference more liberal church leadership, and he appears to have both supported the liberal-leaning Pope Francis and criticised the US president's policies on social media. 
But the president so far has said only that Leo's election was a ""great honour"" for the US. Still, some of Trump's most prominent supporters were quick to attack Pope Leo, lambasting him as a possible challenge to Trump and on the perception that he will follow Pope Francis in areas like immigration. 
""I mean it's kind of jaw-dropping,"" Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon told the BBC on Friday, speaking of Leo's election.
""It is shocking to me that a guy could be selected to be the Pope that had had the Twitter feed and the statements he's had against American senior politicians,"" said Bannon, a hard-right Trump loyalist, practising Catholic and former altar boy. 
And he predicted that there's ""definitely going to be friction"" between Leo and Trump. 
Pope Leo XIV calls Church 'a beacon to illuminate dark nights' in first Mass
Pope's first speech in full
Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?
The Pope's brother, John Prevost, told The New York Times, external that he thinks his brother would voice his disagreements with the president.
""I know he's not happy with what's going on with immigration,"" he said. ""I know that for a fact. How far he'll go with it is only one's guess, but he won't just sit back. I don't think he'll be the silent one.""
Recent survey data shows that about 20% of Americans identify as Catholic, according to the non-partisan Pew Research Center. 
About 53% identify with or lean towards the Republican Party, though there's plenty of nuance, too: America's two Catholic presidents, John F Kennedy and Joe Biden, were both Democrats. And nearly two-thirds of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances - a departure from the Church's current stance. 
US Catholics also broadly supported Pope Francis: 78% of those surveyed in February viewed him favorably, including a majority of Catholic Republicans.
A number of Catholics in the new Pope's home city of Chicago on Thursday aired disappointment with President Trump and said they hoped Pope Leo XIV would follow the path of his predecessor.
""We hope he'll continue with Francis's agenda going forward,"" said Rick Stevens, a Catholic deacon from New Jersey who happened to be visiting Chicago when he heard the news.
The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads and coordinates US Catholic activities, celebrated Pope Leo's election and the message it sends.
""Certainly, we rejoice that a son of this nation has been chosen by the cardinals, but we recognise that he now belongs to all Catholics and to all people of good will,"" the conference said in a statement. ""His words advocating peace, unity, and missionary activity already indicate a path forward.""
Though Maga supporters represent a small subset of US Catholics, it's one with outsized access to conservative media and Trump's ear. 
On Bannon's War Room podcast - known for its hard-right, pro-Trump bent - one guest after another heaped criticism on the new Pope.
""This guy has been massively embraced by the liberals and the progressives,"" said Ben Harnwell, a journalist who led Bannon's efforts to establish what he calls a ""gladiator school"" for the ""Judeo-Christian West"" outside of Rome.
""He is one of their ownâ¦ he has [Pope] Francis's DNA in him,"" Harnwell said.
The new Pope's brother, Louis Prevost, says his sibling was always dedicated to the church
Jack Posobiec, another Maga commentator dialing in from Rome, was blunt: ""This choice of the American cardinal was done as a response, as a message to President Trump.""
The full picture of what led to Pope Leo's selection on Thursday is still emerging and church decisions don't map neatly onto US politics. Still, watchers around the world have pored over Pope Leo's social media profiles in search of clues about his leanings and beliefs.  
An X account under his name, with tweets going as far back as 2015, shares links to criticism of Trump's approach to immigration and hints at other political views, such as stricter gun control. 
In February, the account sharply rebuked the US vice-president by posting a link to an opinion piece titled ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others"".
The account also posted a link to a letter from Pope Francis after he clashed with Vance over church doctrine and immigration. Vance â a Catholic convert â had given an interview in defence of the Trump administration's immigration policies.
Vance has routinely invoked his faith in defence of the administration, particularly immigration policies, which the White House has said put ""America first"".
""There is a Christian concept that you love your family and then you love your neighbour, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens, and then after that, prioritise the rest of the world. A lot of the far left has completely inverted that,"" Vance told Fox News.
What is behind the new Pope's chosen name, Leo?

But US Democrats were not spared either on the account, which has more than a decade of posts. They appear to support Catholic employers who refuse to pay for contraceptives via employee health plans, and following the 2016 US presidential election, one post links to an article accusing Democrat Hillary Clinton of ignoring pro-life Catholic voters.
The BBC asked the Vatican to confirm the account was Leo's, but did not receive a response.
Vice-President Vance told conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt, external on Friday: ""I try not to play the politicisation of the Pope game.
""I'm sure he's going to say a lot of things that I love. I'm sure he'll say some things that I disagree with, but I'll continue to pray for him and the Church despite it all and through it all, and that'll be the way that I handle it.""
The new Pope's LGBTQ views are also unclear, but some groups, including the conservative College of Cardinals, believe he may be less supportive than Pope Francis.
Matt Walsh, a commentator with the conservative Daily Wire, wrote: ""There are some good signs and bad signs with this new Pope. I want to see what he actually does with his papacy before I pass any kind of judgment.""
But some of the most dedicated Maga supporters already have made up their minds.
Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who has Trump's ear, swaying the president on top personnel decisions, called the new Pope ""anti-Trump, anti-Maga, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis"".
Bannon, who had suggested Leo as a dark horse for the papacy, predicted tensions between the White House and Vatican - and said they could even tear apart American Catholics.
""Remember, President Trump was not shy about taking a shot at Pope Francis,"" he said.
""So if this Pope - which he will do - tries to come between President Trump and his implementation of the mass deportation programme, I would stand by.""

The mayor of New Jersey's largest city has been released following his arrest on Friday after allegedly trying to force his way into a migrant detention facility.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka ""committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings"" to leave Delaney Hall, a facility being run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to acting US attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba. 
Baraka was accompanied by three Democratic members of Congress who were not arrested. They say they were there to conduct ""oversight"" to ensure the facility was not violating any building safety ordinances.
Baraka told CNN he did not break any laws and was ""exercising my right and duty as an elected official"".  
He has been charged with one count of trespassing. 
Ms Habba, who previously worked as a personal lawyer for US President Donald Trump, wrote on X on Friday that Baraka ""committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center"".
""He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state,"" her statement added.
A separate statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that a group of protesters, which included the Democrats, ""stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility"" as a bus containing illegal migrants was being brought inside the fenced perimeter.
""These members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and the detainees at risk,"" the statement added. 
Baraka told CNN on Friday night that he did not enter the 1,000-bed facility unlawfully. He said he was there for a news conference with the three members of Congress who had been granted entry into the facility.
Videos posted online of the arrest show a chaotic scene as protesters and officers physically clash and Baraka, who is also running to be New Jersey governor, is led away in handcuffs.
Shortly before he is arrested, the footage shows officers telling Baraka he will not be allowed inside. At one point he is told: ""That is the last warning. You will be placed under arrest.""
New Jersey's Democratic Governor Phil Murphy said he was ""outraged"" by Baraka's arrest.
Baraka was taken to a DHS detention centre. When he was released after a few hours, he told supporters who had gathering outside the facility: ""We didn't do anything wrong.""
Earlier this year, Newark filed a lawsuit attempting to block use of the facility, which has become a flashpoint over the Trump administration's deportation policies. 
City officials allege the private firm that signed a contract with ICE to operate the facility did not obtain proper permits and blocked necessary inspections. The firm has told media they have the proper permits, while the DHS has said all permits and inspections were up to date. 
New Jersey Democratic lawmakers Rob Menendez Jr, Bonnie Watson Coleman and LaMonica McIver were also present during the protest.
Earlier on Friday, Watson Coleman posted on social media: ""We're at Delaney Hall, an ICE prison in Newark that opened without permission from the city & in violation of local ordinances. 
""We've heard stories of what it's like in other ICE prisons. We're exercising our oversight authority to see for ourselves.""
In another post, McIver said that Baraka ""did nothing wrong"" and had already left the facility when he was arrested.
The move comes as federal agencies continue their crackdown on illegal immigration, following up on a key campaign promise made by Trump."

""Thank you so much. I am a little bit tired, so I will take some time to rest,"" she told reporters and supporters who were crowded outside the facility.
US District Judge William Sessions said the student met all the conditions needed for release and lambasted the government's case against her.
Ms Otzurk, a doctoral student from Turkey, co-authored an opinion piece in her campus newspaper that was critical of Israel's war. Her arrest follows the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US campuses. 
""Her continued detention chills the speech of millions in this country who are not citizens,"" the judge said on Friday as he ordered her release.
Ms Ozturk walked out of the detention facility after six weeks in custody and was greeted by cheers and with her hands on her heart.
She had been detained since March, when US immigration officials arrested her on the streets in Massachusetts. 
Videos of the arrest showed masked plain-clothes officers surrounding her after a Ramadan celebration, handcuffing her and then taking her into an unmarked car. Her detention sparked nationwide protests.
The US Department of Homeland Security had accused Ms Ozturk of ""engag[ing] in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organisation that relishes the killing of Americans"". 
After the judge's ruling, a DHS spokesperson responded: ""Visas provided to foreign students to live and study in the United States are a privilege not a right. 
""The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country.""
Earlier this week, the judge ordered that Ms Ozturk be transferred by 14 May to immigration authorities in Vermont, where she was last held before she was moved to Louisiana.
On Friday, Judge Sessions said that she should be released immediately without travel restrictions, so she can go to Vermont or Massachusetts, where Tufts is located, as needed. 
He heard from a number of witnesses in the case, including Ms Ozturk, her doctor and a Tufts University professor. The government did not call any witnesses during Friday's hearing.  
During her testimony, which she offered virtually, Ms Ozturk told the court about her Fulbright scholarship and her PhD work. She said her asthma had worsened during her detention, and at one point she had to take a short break after suffering an asthma attack on camera.
Judge Sessions said Ms Ozturk had raised ""very substantial"" claims that her First Amendment right to free speech and her due process rights were violated. He said the only evidence the administration had against Ms Ozturk was her op-ed.
""That literally is the case,"" he said, according to court reporters. ""There is no evidence that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence.""
In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is representing Ms Ozturk, said they were ""delighted"" by her release. 
""RÃ¼meysa can now return to her beloved Tufts community, resume her studies, and begin teaching again,"" said Noor Zafar, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU. 
""Today's ruling underscores a vital First Amendment principle: no one should be imprisoned by the government for expressing their beliefs.""
A spokesman for Tufts said the university is ""pleased"" with the judge's ruling, adding: ""We look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies"".
The Trump administration has detained several international students - some legal residents - who have organised in support of the Palestinians.
Last week, a judge ordered the government to release Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi after immigration officials detained him during a naturalisation interview.
The 34-year-old permanent resident was raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank and had been held at a facility in Vermont.
One of the highest profile cases thus far involves Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, a prominent pro-Palestinian activist, who remains in a Louisiana detention facility without charges."

Even before his name was announced from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, the crowds below were chanting ""Viva il Papa"" - Long live the Pope.
Robert Francis Prevost, 69, has become the 267th occupant of the throne of St Peter and he will be known as Leo XIV. 
He is the first American to fill the role of pope, although he is considered as much a cardinal from Latin America because of the many years he spent as a missionary in Peru.
Born in Chicago in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Leo served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. 
Although he moved to Peru three years later, he returned regularly to the US to serve as a priest and a prior in his home city. 
He has Peruvian nationality and is fondly remembered as a figure who worked with marginalised communities and helped build bridges.
He spent 10 years as a local parish pastor and as a teacher at a seminary in Trujillo in north-western Peru.

Pope Leo's first public address from the Vatican balcony - watch in full
In his first words as Pope, Leo spoke fondly of his predecessor Francis. 
""We still hear in our ears the weak but always courageous voice of Pope Francis who blessed us,"" he said.
""United and hand-in-hand with God, let us advance together,"" he told cheering crowds. 
Cardinal Prevost shares a quiet moment with Pope Francis (R) in February 2025
The Pope also spoke of his role in the Augustinian Order. 
In 2014, Francis made him Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru.
He is well known to cardinals because of his high-profile role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops which has the important task of selecting and supervising bishops.
He became archbishop in January 2023 and within a few months, Francis made him a cardinal.
From white smoke to balcony speech, watch Pope Leo XIV unveiled as new pontiff
The new pontiff was born in Chicago in 1955, and served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. 
Before becoming the new leader of the Catholic Church, Leo told Italian network Rai that he grew up in a family of immigrants.
""I was born in the United States... But my grandparents were all immigrants, French, Spanish... I was raised in a very Catholic family, both of my parents were very engaged in the parish,"" he said. 
Although Leo was born in the US, the Vatican described him as the second pope from the Americas (Francis was from Argentina).
Jari Honora, a genealogist and historian in the US state of Louisiana, said Leo has strong ties to New Orleans' black community.
He told the BBC that the new pontiff's maternal grandparents lived in a now-demolished home in the city's seventh ward, and she also rented a place in the iconic Pontalba building in New Orleans' French Quarter.
Mr Honora said Pope Leo's grandparents are described as black or mulatto in historical records, but that the family's identity was listed as white when they moved to Chicago - a common practice among black families looking to escape racial segregation.
The Pope's background ""indicates that [American] stories, the experiences of our ancestors are more tightly woven than we could have ever imagined,"" he said.
""It shrinks that gap between Rome and New Orleans or New Orleans and Chicago.""
Analysis: Continuity the key for Pope seen as unifier in the Church
Reaction: 'I flipped out, I said no way!' - Chicago celebrates hometown Pope
'God loves Peru': Country celebrates new Pope as one of their own
Early attention will focus on Leo XIV's pronouncements to see whether he will continue his predecessor's reforms in the Roman Catholic Church.
In choosing his papal name, Leo has signified a commitment to dynamic social issues, according to experts. 
The first pontiff to use the name Leo, whose papacy ended in 461, met Attila the Hun and persuaded him not to attack Rome. 
The last Pope Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903 and wrote an influential treatise on workers' rights.
Former Archbishop of Boston SeÃ¡n Patrick O'Malley wrote on his blog that the new pontiff ""has chosen a name widely associated with the social justice legacy of Pope Leo XIII, who was pontiff at a time of epic upheaval in the world, the time of the industrial revolution, the beginning of Marxism, and widespread immigration"".
The new Pope's LGBT views are unclear, but some groups, including the conservative College of Cardinals, believe he may be less supportive than Francis.
Leo XIV has shown support for a declaration from Francis to permit blessings for same-sex couples and others in ""irregular situations"", although he has added that bishops must interpret such directives in accordance with local contexts and cultures.
Speaking last year about climate change, Cardinal Prevost said that it was time to move ""from words to action"".
He called on mankind to build a ""relationship of reciprocity"" with the environment.
And he has spoken about concrete measures at the Vatican, including the installation of solar panels and the adoption of electric vehicles.
Pope Leo XIV has supported Pope Francis' decision to allow women for the first time to join the Dicastery for Bishops, an administrative body that identifies and recommends future bishops to the Holy See. 
""On several occasions we have seen that their point of view is an enrichment,"" he told Vatican News in 2023.
In 2024, he told the Catholic News Service that women's presence ""contributes significantly to the process of discernment in looking for who we hope are the best candidates to serve the Church in episcopal ministry"".
The new pontiff is believed to have shared Francis' views on migrants, the poor and the environment.
A former roommate of his, Reverend John Lydon, described Leo to the BBC as ""outgoing"", ""down to earth"" and ""very concerned with the poor"".
In recent months, he appears to have challenged the views of US Vice-President JD Vance.
A social media account in his name shared a social media post on X that was critical of the Trump administration's deportation of a US resident to El Salvador.
The account also shared a critical comment piece written about a TV interview by Vance.
""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others,"" read the post, repeating the headline from the commentary on the National Catholic Reporter website.
Shortly after, the account shared another article, published by The Jesuit Review, and commented that Catholics ""cannot support a rhetoric that demonizes immigrants as dangerously criminal simply because they have crossed the border in search of a better life for themselves and their families"".
The BBC has contacted the Vatican but has not independently confirmed the account, which was created in 2011, belongs to the new pontiff.
Leo moved to Peru as a missionary in 1985 to work in various rural communities.
He was known for working with marginalised people, and immersed himself in learning Spanish.
After a stint back in the United States, he returned to Peru again in 1988 to the city of Trujillo on the north coast where he trained young men to be priests and taught canon law.
In late 2014, when he was back in the US, he was put forward by Pope Francis to return to Peru as the Apostolic Administrator of Chiclayo, a diocese on Peru's north coast and the following year he was appointed the Bishop of Chiclayo. He served in this role for nearly a decade.
In 2015, he obtained Peruvian citizenship. He reportedly often referred to Peru as ""mi segunda patria"", my second homeland.
He championed various charities such as supporting soup kitchens and childcare for struggling families, and advocated for better housing on the north coast, which is prone to floods.
But not all in the country are proud of his record.
Accusations have been made about his handling of sexual abuse cases during his time as Bishop of Chiclayo. Three Peruvian women are among those who went public with claims that - as bishop - he failed to investigate and punish a priest accused of sexually abusing them, with claims dating back to 2007.
They said that when they raised their allegations with the diocese in 2022, no substantial or serious inquiry was opened.
Church officials denied this and said an investigation was opened, but was closed in 2023 by the ecclesiastical district and the Vatican after a local prosecutor said there was not enough evidence to support the civil claim.
An investigation by the prosecutor was reopened after media reports about the case and the BBC understands it is ongoing.
The BBC spoke in Chiclayo to Jesus Leon Angeles, who supports the parish where the accused priest works.
She said while the parish was ""in defence of women"", it was also ""in defence of the truth"" and claimed the allegations were part of a ""campaign"" against Leo when he became a cardinal in Rome.
These allegations and the continued fallout from sexual abuse scandals within the Church are one of the challenges he will face as he now leads Catholics worldwide.

South Africa has criticised the US as reports emerge suggesting Washington could receive white Afrikaners as refugees as early as next week.
A document seen by the BBC's US partner CBS describes the potential resettlement as a ""priority"" for President Donald Trump's government, however the timing has not been publicly confirmed by the White House.
In a statement published on Friday, external, South Africa's foreign ministry described the purported move as ""politically motivated"" and designed to undermine South Africa's ""constitutional democracy"".
In February, Trump described Afrikaners as victims of ""racial discrimination"" in an executive order, opening up the prospect for them to resettle in the US.
The South African authorities said they would not block the departures of those chosen for resettlement, but said they had sought assurances from the US that those selected had been fully vetted and did not have pending criminal charges.
The  statement added that allegations of discrimination against the country's white minority were unfounded, and that crime statistics did not indicate that any racial group had been targeted in violent crimes on farms. 
Some groups representing the rights of white farmers have said they are being deliberately killed because of their race. 
A spokesperson for the US state department told the BBC they were interviewing individuals interested in resettling in the US and prioritising ""Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination"". 
They did not confirm when the resettlement would begin.
The Trump administration has also accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, something Pretoria has repeatedly denied. 
Elon Musk, a top adviser in the Trump administration who grew up in South Africa during apartheid, has been critical of Pretoria, claiming that it is leading a ""genocide"" against white farmers. 
US officials have planned a press event on Monday at Dulles airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents seen by CBS show.
According to US media, 54 Afrikaners will arrive as part of the first group. 
The decision to accept South Africans as refugees comes as the Trump administration has halted nearly all migrant asylum claims. 
In February, South Africa criticised Trump's executive order opening the US up to the resettlement of white Afrikaners, saying in a statement that ""it is ironic"" the US is open to accepting  a group ""that remains amongst the most economically privileged"" while denying vulnerable people from other parts of the world asylum.

The 72-year-old made millions of pounds from protecting businesses in conflict zones before he took part in the failed attempt to overthrow the west African nation's ruler.
Mann was sentenced to 34 years in prison on arms charges and later said he had been the ""manager, not the architect"" of the scheme.
In 2009, the ex-SAS commando was pardoned, released and given 48 hours to leave the country.
The plot had been an attempt to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema - at the time Mann and co-conspirators said the aim was to install exiled opposition leader Severo Moto.
It was uncovered after police in Zimbabwe's capital Harare impounded a plane which had flown in from South Africa.
Mann and more than 60 others were arrested, amid claims they were mercenaries.
They said they were providing security for a mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Simon Mann (second from left) said he had been the attempted coup's ""manager, not the architect""
Mann attended private boys' school Eton before studying at Sandhurst Royal Military Academy and then joining the Scots Guards.
He became a member of the SAS - the army's special forces unit - and rose through the ranks to become a commander.
In 2011, he said the attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea - which saw him arrested with fellow mercenaries after trying to load weapons onto a plane in Zimbabwe - was foiled by the CIA.
After serving three years of his 34-year sentence in Zimbabwe, he was moved to Black Beach Prison in Equatorial Guinea.
Speaking in 2011 about that move, he said ""friends, family, and enemies"" had told him ""if that happens, you have had it, you're a dead man"".
After being pardoned and released, he expressed regret for what he had done, saying that ""however good the money is"", the moral case ""has to stack up""."

A diver has died during preliminary operations to recover British tech tycoon Mike Lynch's superyacht from the waters off the coast of northern Sicily, local police said.
The accident happened on Friday while the diver was underwater in Porticello, police said, adding the precise cause of death was still unknown.
According to local Italian media, the diver was a 39-year-old Dutch national who worked for a specialist salvage company.
It comes as salvage ships arrived earlier this month to waters off the small port of Porticello, near Palermo, where the Bayesian vessel sank during freak weather last August.
Seven of the 22 people onboard the Bayesian last summer were killed, including Mr Lynch, 59, and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah.
Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy, 71, US lawyer Chris Morvillo, his wife Neda Morvillo and the yacht's chef Recaldo Thomas, who was originally from Antigua, also died in the sinking on 19 August.
Fifteen people managed to escape on a lifeboat including a one-year-old and Mr Lynch's wife Angela Bacares.
The cause of the sinking is still under investigation with naval experts saying a yacht of Bayesian's calibre should have been able to withstand the storm and  certainly should not have sunk as rapidly as it did.
Hannah and Mike Lynch were among seven people who died when the Bayesian sank
The salvage operation is being overseen by British marine consultancy TMC Marine and led by Dutch-based companies Hebo, a maritime services company from Rotterdam, and SMIT Salvage, with support from Italian specialists.
About 70 specialist personnel have been deployed to Sicily from across Europe to work on the recovery operation.

On Thursday, the team said on-site preparations were on schedule and ""significant progress"" had been made over the past five days.
Analysis of the yacht and the surrounding seabed confirmed there had been no change to its condition since the last inspection, meaning plans to raise the vessel can now go ahead.
Work to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface was scheduled to begin later this month - subject to suitable weather and sea conditions.
Before the vessel is transported to port, sea water will be pumped out of it.
The Bayesian left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on 14 August before it sank on 19 August
Before the Bayesian is raised it will be held in position by steel slings, as salvage workers detach the vessel's extensive rigging and 72m (236ft) mast, thought to be one of the tallest in the world.
These will then be stored on the seabed and recovered after the team has recovered the ship's hull, which investigators say is a primary source of evidence.
There has not been any pollution from the yacht reported, with conditions being monitored and efforts made to secure its tank vents and openings.
Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Mr Lynch and his daughter, and Mr and Mrs Bloomer, who were all British nationals.

Mexico is suing Google for ignoring repeated requests not to rename the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America for US users on its maps service, Claudia Sheinbaum has said. 
The Mexican president did not say where the lawsuit had been filed. Google did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. 
On Thursday, the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to officially rename the Gulf for federal agencies.
US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office in January calling for the body of water to be renamed, arguing the change was justified because the US ""do most of the work there, and it's ours"".
However, Sheinbaum's government contends that Trump's order applies only to the US portion of the continental shelf.
""All we want is for the decree issued by the US government to be complied with,"" she said, asserting that the US lacks the authority to rename the entire gulf.
Sheinbaum wrote a letter to Google in January asking the firm to reconsider its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico for US users. The following month, she threatened legal action. 
At the time, Google said it made the change as part of ""a longstanding practice"" of following name changes when updated by official government sources.
It said the gulf - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - would not be changed for people using the app in Mexico, and users elsewhere in the world will see the label: ""Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)"".
The Gulf of Mexico has been renamed the Gulf of America on Google Maps in the US
The Associated Press (AP) news agency's refusal to use the Gulf of America name led to a months-long conflict with the White House, which restricted AP's access to certain events. 
A federal judge ordered the White House in April to stop sidelining the outlet.
Trump hinted on Wednesday that he may recommend changing the way the US refers to another body of water. 
During an upcoming visit to Saudi Arabia, he plans to announce that the US will henceforth refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia, AP reported. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has responded by saying he hopes the ""absurd rumours"" are ""no more than a disinformation campaign"" and that such a move would ""bring the wrath of all Iranians""."

The announcement comes after Trump withdrew his first pick for the job after he lost key Republican support in the Senate, which votes on such positions. 
After Trump's 2020 loss to Joe Biden, Pirro made false statements about the election that were part of a lawsuit against Fox News by a company that makes voting machines. The case was settled for more than $787m (Â£594m).
Trump called Pirro ""a powerful crusader for victims of crime"" in a social media post announcing his selection. Meanwhile, critics described her as unqualified.
The president did not indicate whether Pirro, 73, would serve in the job permanently, which requires Senate confirmation, or how long her term would last. 
In the Truth Social post on Thursday night, Trump noted that she previously served as a Republican district attorney in Westchester, New York, as well as a judge. He also touted her roles on various shows on Fox News, including on The Five, which he called ""one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television"". 
Pirro has been a close ally of Trump for decades. In one of his last actions during his first term, he issued a pardon to her husband, who had been convicted of tax evasion decades earlier.
Democrats were quick to criticise the appointment of Pirro, the second Fox News host with to receive a high-profile federal job after Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, raising questions about her credentials for the role and about her career outside of broadcasting.
""Which Fox News host will get the next federal appointment,"" Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat representative from California, wrote on X.
The Democratic National Committee wrote in a statement: ""Jeanine Pirro is yet another unqualified TV personality with a history of putting Trump and violent insurrectionists above the rule of law.""
Republicans, like South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, celebrated the news on social media. He called Pirro a ""grand slam, home run"" choice.
""She is exactly the right person at the right time to take on this responsibility,"" Graham said on X.
Pirro replaces current interim US attorney Ed Martin, a former conservative podcaster who Trump appointed this January.
He was let go after North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a key swing vote, said he would refuse to confirm Martin for the role on a permanent basis, citing ""friction"" over how Martin viewed those involved in the 6 January 2021 riots at the US Capitol. 
Tillis told reporters this week that he had ""no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on January 6"".
Martin has been a staunch critic of the investigation into the Capitol riots. While serving in the role on an interim basis, he fired prosecutors who oversaw prosecutions of alleged and convicted rioters. 
Trump said Martin will remain at the US Justice Department and serve as director of the ""weaponization working group"", which looks into officials who investigated Trump, the president said in another post on social media. 
Since taking office, Trump has issued pardons and ended prosecutions against 6 January rioters who stormed the US Capitol in an effort to block Biden's election win over Trump in the 2020 election."

The prime suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance faces a new unrelated charge, the BBC has been told.
Christian BrÃ¼ckner is due in court next week accused of insulting a member of prison staff.
The precise details of the allegation have not been made public.
If found guilty, it could potentially extend his current jail term that is due to end in September, according to a court official.
BrÃ¼ckner, 48, is behind bars in Germany for raping a 72-year-old American tourist in Portugal in 2005. He has never been charged in the McCann case and denies involvement.
Three-year-old Madeleine McCann vanished from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, in Portugal's Algarve region, in 2007.
It has become one of the highest-profile, unsolved missing person cases in the world.
BrÃ¼ckner was not identified as a suspect in her disappearance until 2020.
German investigators classed the case as a murder inquiry.
However, no charges have ever been brought against BrÃ¼ckner, in the McCann case, and the full details of the alleged evidence have never been released.
A convicted child sex offender, BrÃ¼ckner is a German national who has a history of sex, forgery, drug, and theft offences.
A drifter, he lived in Portugal's Algarve region, on and off, for years.
Now prosecutors are working against the clock as BrÃ¼ckner is scheduled to walk free in September 2025.
Investigators fear that BrÃ¼ckner, as a free man, will skip Germany and disappear.
A ruling, last year, paved the way for his release when he was acquitted of five other sex offence allegations.
In October 2024, judges cleared BrÃ¼ckner of three counts of rape and two counts of child sex abuse â charges dating back to between 2000 and 2017 in Portugal.
Prosecutors have launched an appeal, but a decision on any potential retrial may yet take months.
BrÃ¼ckner is due in court on Thursday morning in Lehrte, Lower Saxony, to face the charge of insulting a prison staff member, a court official told the BBC.
If found guilty, BrÃ¼ckner could face either a fine or up to an additional year in jail.
Interest in BrÃ¼ckner's legal battles continues to be high due to his name being linked, by the authorities, to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.
Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters told the BBC he was aware of the upcoming, unrelated trial at Lehrte District Court, but that it is being handled by a different office.
He also reiterated there are still no plans to charge BrÃ¼ckner over the McCann case.
In 2020, Mr Wolters told the BBC the public would reach the same conclusion as his team had, about BrÃ¼ckner's alleged involvement, if they ""knew the evidence we had"".
The BBC has approached Christian BrÃ¼ckner's legal team for comment."

The US has confirmed that a new system for providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza through private companies is being prepared, as Israel's blockade continues for a third month.
US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said ""distribution centres"" protected by security contractors would provide food and other supplies to over a million people initially, as part of an effort to prevent Hamas stealing aid.
He denied Israel would take part in aid delivery or distribution, but said its forces would secure the centres' perimeters.
It comes as details emerged about the controversial plan, which UN agencies have reiterated they will not co-operate with because it appears to ""weaponise"" aid.
""We will not participate,"" the spokesman for the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Jens Laerke, told the BBC in Geneva, ""only in efforts that are in line with our principles"". 
He added: ""There is no reason to put in place a system that is at odds with the DNA of any principled humanitarian organisation.""
Since early March, Israel has cut off all supplies from reaching Gaza - including food, shelters, medicines and fuel - leading to a humanitarian crisis for its 2.1 million residents.
A third of the community kitchens in Gaza - one of the territory's last remaining lifelines - have been forced to shut down over the past two weeks due to shortages of food and fuel, according to OCHA. 
Among them were the last two field kitchens of World Central Kitchen, a US-based charity which had been providing 133,000 meals daily before it ran out of ingredients on Tuesday.
Prices of basic foodstuffs have also skyrocketed at local markets, with a 25kg (55lb) bag of flour now selling for $415 (Â£313) in Gaza City - a 30-fold increase compared to the end of February, OCHA says.
Mike Huckabee said US President Donald Trump wanted to do everything possible to get aid into Gaza
Huckabee told journalists in Jerusalem that US President Donald Trump saw aid for Gaza as an urgent matter and that his team was tasked ""to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid into the people"".
Israel and the US accuse Hamas of diverting aid. ""Previous actions have often been met with Hamas stealing the food that was intended for hungry people,"" the ambassador said.
The UN and other agencies say they have strong supervisory mechanisms and that when aid has surged into Gaza, incidents of looting have largely halted. The World Health Organization says none of its medical supplies have been looted during the war.
The Trump administration is trying to build momentum behind the new aid initiative ahead of the president's trip next week to wealthy Arab Gulf countries that could help to fund it. 
It says that a non-governmental organisation has been set up and that aid delivery will not be under Israeli military control.
Huckabee said: ""The Israelis are going to be involved in providing necessary security because this is a war zone. But they will not be involved in the distribution of the food, or even the bringing of food into Gaza.""
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked on Friday whether the plan would ""militarise"" aid distribution in the region.
""I would reject that characterisation,"" she responded. 
The newly registered Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) appears to have been set up for this purpose.
A 14-page document from GHF, seen by the BBC, promises to set up four distribution sites, giving out food, water and hygiene kits initially for 1.2 million people - less than 60% of the population. It says the project aims to reach all Gazans eventually.
Aimed at potential donors, the paper states that ""months of conflict have collapsed traditional relief channels in Gaza"".
It goes on: ""GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly - and only - to those in need.""
The document maintains that GHF is ""guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence"".
Its boards of directors and advisors are said to include a former chief executive of World Central Kitchen, along with the American former head of the UN's World Food Programme, David Beasley - though his participation is not yet confirmed.
Full details of how the aid mechanism will work on the ground are not given.
The Israeli military says it plans to expand the Gaza offensive to return the remaining hostages and defeat Hamas
The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.
Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,700 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Last Sunday, Israel's security cabinet approved an intensified military offensive against Hamas in Gaza which could involve forcibly displacing the population to the south, seizing the entire territory indefinitely, and controlling aid.
This was quickly met with widespread international condemnation. Many of Israel's allies pointed out that it was bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.
The UK's Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, told Parliament on Monday that the British government was gravely concerned that the Israeli announcements could lead to the 19-month-long war in Gaza entering ""a dangerous new phase"".
On the subject of aid, he said: ""As the UN has said, it is hard to see how, if implemented, the new Israeli plan to deliver aid through private companies would be consistent with humanitarian principles and meet the scale of the need. We need urgent clarity from the Israeli government on their intentions.
""We must remember what is at stake. These humanitarian principles matter for every conflict around the world. They should be applied consistently in every war zone.""
Some 90% of Gaza population has been displaced during the war, often many times
This week, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, briefed members of the UN Security Council - which includes the UK - behind closed doors about the new plan to resume the delivery of aid.
The Council's five European members - the UK, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia - have requested an urgent meeting to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza, likely to be scheduled for Tuesday.
The UK delegation said Israel's blockade was ""inexcusable"", adding that the only way to end the suffering of both Palestinians and Israelis was to return to a ceasefire, secure the release of all hostages and ""surge"" aid into Gaza. 
Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that Israeli forces were already setting up distribution hubs in Rafah, in southern Gaza, in ""a sterile zone"" designed to be free of any Hamas presence.
According to reports, Israel expects that aid will be distributed to security-screened representatives from each Gazan family who would be allowed to take supplies for his or her relatives only. They would be allowed into the hubs only on foot.
The Israeli defence establishment was said to have assessed that the average quantity of aid that would have to be distributed as 70kg (154lb) per family per week.
The Israeli military would ultimately be stationed outside the distribution hubs, allowing aid workers to hand out food without soldiers being directly involved, the reports say.
Israel and the US argue that the new system would prevent Hamas from being able to steal food for its own benefit. By preventing its access to aid and involvement in security for convoys, they hope to reduce the group's influence over the Gazan population.
However, there are major questions over the plan's feasibility. The current UN system uses some 400 points of aid distribution, while the situation in Gaza is now at a crisis point, with warnings that mass starvation is imminent.
About 60,000 children in Gaza are estimated to require treatment for acute malnutrition
At a UN briefing in Geneva, aid officials said they had carried out ""careful analysis"" before deciding they could not participate in the US-Israeli scheme. They said they had not been formally presented with the GHF document that is currently circulating.
James Elder, spokesman for the UN's children's agency Unicef, said the plan that had been laid out would lead to more children suffering, not fewer. He noted that civilians would have to travel to militarised zones to receive aid, meaning the most vulnerable - children and the elderly - would struggle to get there.
He said the decision to locate all the distribution points in the south appeared designed to use aid as ""a bait"" to forcibly displace Gazans once again. The UN says 90% of the population has been displaced during the war, often many times.
The plan that has been discussed with UN agencies envisages just 60 lorry loads of aid entering each day - far less than they say is needed to meet growing needs, and a tenth of the number that went in daily during the recent two-month ceasefire.
OCHA's Jens Laerke said that in short, the proposals from Israel ""do not meet the minimum bar for principled humanitarian support"".
Analysts say that the current impasse over aid for Gaza is not only an existential threat to the UN's vast humanitarian operation in the Palestinian territory but could also have implications for its future work.
If it was to agree to a scheme accommodating the demands of the military on one side in a conflict, it could dent perceptions of the UN's neutrality and impartiality, and set a dangerous precedent leading to similar demands in other war zones where it operates.
The UN and other aid agencies also point out that they currently have tonnes of supplies piled up near Gaza's border crossings, ready to enter, if Israel would allow it.
Without an end to the blockade, the risk of famine is expected to grow.
Umm Ahmed (L) said she would not comply with Israeli efforts to force her to move south to Rafah to receive aid
In Jabalia, in northern Gaza, which has already been the focus of Israeli military operations against Hamas, Palestinian families told the BBC of their growing despair as they waited for a food handout at a takia, or community kitchen, which turned into a chaotic scramble.
""Every day I come here and wait with my cooking pot to feed my children,"" Umm Ahmed said. ""The pot doesn't fill us up. We have been suffering for two months. There's no flour or anything. Open the borders so we can eat properly.""
She said she would not comply with Israeli efforts to force her to move south to Rafah to receive aid.
""We don't have money for transport, we don't have money to eat!"" she exclaimed. ""I don't want to evacuate from here, I'd rather die than leave.""
""The takia is our last source of food,"" said Mohammed, who had been waiting for five hours in line. ""My wife is pregnant and sick, and I'm unable to get her to the hospital. How am I supposed to get to Rafah?""

As the continuing India-Pakistan crisis takes a dangerous turn, nations around the world are urging calm.
The initial thinking was that after India launched air strikes, and with Pakistan claiming to have shot down several Indian jets - a claim Delhi has not confirmed - both sides could claim ""victory"" and de-escalate.
But there's a danger that any protracted tit-for-tat attacks could lead them to a far more damaging prospect.
During past conflicts, such as in 2019 and 2016, it was the United States and a few other global powers that put pressure on Delhi and Islamabad to bring the situation under control and de-escalate.
Now passions are running high and the nationalist rhetoric has reached a crescendo on both sides. The neighbours are closer to war than in recent decades.
Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it
What we know about India's strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir
âThe World community is keeping quiet; thatâs dangerous,â Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani academic who is a senior fellow at Kingâs College London. 
âThough the flare up has been happening for decades, this is the first time the two countries find themselves in a conflict without anyone monitoring them or forcefully telling them to stop,â she said.
Unless Washington gets more involved, Islamabad and Delhi may continue with their accusations and counter-accusations.
Although US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been telling the senior leaders of India and Pakistan to de-escalate, the message from other American leaders is different.
US Vice-President JD Vance has said that a potential war between India and Pakistan would be ""none of our business"" during an interview with Fox News.
""We want this thing to de-escalate as quickly as possible. We can't control these countries, though,"" Vance said.
Vance was on a visit to India when the militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 civilians, took place.
US President Donald Trump had earlier called rising tension between India and Pakistan a ""shame"".
Local residents stand beside the wreckage of their home that was damaged amid Pakistani artillery shelling
During previous India-Pakistan skirmishes, for example in 2019, tension was defused quickly after India carried out what it called âsurgical strikesâ on what it called terrorist camps inside Pakistan.
One Indian military jet was shot down in the aftermath of the crisis and the pilot was captured by Pakistan. He was released two days later after reported intervention from Washington and other world powers. 
But the intensity of the current conflict is different and passions are running high on both sides.
While the Trump administrationâs priorities are more about tariffs, China and Ukraine-Russia, it may require a concerted attempt by the international community to lower tension between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
The other world power which has a stake in South Asia is China. Beijing has close economic and military ties with Islamabad. It has invested more than $50bn (Â£37.5bn) in Pakistan as parts of its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to boost trade.
China also has unresolved border issues with India and the two countries recently had a border clash in the Himalayan region 2020. Despite the tension, China is the second largest trading partner of India.
""If the US is uninterested [in resolving India-Pakistan tension] then other permanent members of the UN Security Council â P5 - should get involved. It is their responsibility as well,"" Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international affairs expert tells the BBC.
As India accuses Pakistan of supporting the Kashmiri separatist rebels, who carried out the deadly attack on tourists last month, the Chinese academic says ""the P-5 members can launch a credible investigation into the incident"", to address India's concerns.
Gulf states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have close ties to both the countries, could step up their mediation efforts.
Saudi Arabian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir arrived in Delhi on 7 May in what was seen as a surprise visit amid the backdrop of a spike in tensions between India and Pakistan. 
âA good meeting with Adel Al-Jubeir,"" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said, adding that his counterpart âshared Indiaâs perspective on firmly countering terrorismâ.
The Saudi minister arrived in Islamabad on Friday for talks with Pakistan's leaders.
There are an estimated 2.6 million Pakistanis living and working in the Gulf Kingdom. Riyadh has considerable influence in Pakistan.
Saudi Arabia has loaned billions of dollars to Pakistan to bail out the country during economic crises over the years.
One way out of the current crisis could be a situation where both sides can claim victory to satisfy their audience.
Delhi says the missile strikes on suspected militant hideouts inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir were part of a commitment to hold âaccountableâ those responsible for the last monthâs attack in Pahalgam. 
âIndia has already said it has achieved its objectives. Now, the ball is in Pakistanâs court. If they wish to retaliate then that would elicit a strong response from India,â retired Indian Lt Gen D S Hooda said. 
For Pakistan, especially for its powerful military, it would want to show its people that it can stand up against India and teach it a lesson once again by downing five of the Indian air force jets during a dog fight. 
India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its fighter jets in the current skirmish.
But according to Pakistani academic Siddiqa, how the current crisis ends depends on what Indiaâs stated objectives are.
âIndiaâs goal posts keep changing day by day â from punishing Pakistan to attaining something more,â she said."

Community leaders have called for people to stand united as tensions escalate between India and Pakistan following reported military strikes between the two countries.
On Wednesday, Indian forces launched ""Operation Sindoor"" targeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in retaliation for a deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed at least 26 people on 22 April. 
Pakistan denies involvement, but Indian authorities allege attackers included Pakistani nationals.
In the west of England, the impact of the conflict is reverberating on families who are fielding anxious WhatsApp calls. Local leaders are also stepping forward to offer guidance and solidarity.
There is growing concern, not only for relatives overseas, but also over the risk of tensions disrupting the unity between communities in the region.
Bristol Green Party councillor Abdul Malik, who recently returned from his ancestral village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, said the escalation tension has ""caused a lot of grief"". 
After Wednesday's strikes in Pakistan, a gathering was held at Easton's Jamia Mosque. 
""It's so important to give a sense of security to the elders who've lived most of their lives in the UK but still feel so connected to what happens abroad,"" said Mr Malik.
""This isn't a war about religion. This is a political war about borders. We must not bring hatred to our streets and our homes.
""Bristol has a wonderful Indian and Pakistani community. We've sat together. We've listened. This is the time to stand united - and that's what we intend to do.""
A gathering was held at the Easton Jamia Mosque on Wednesday afternoon
""Trying to avoid any conflicts is my main concern,"" said Pankaj Pandya, one of the trustees of the Hindu Temple in Bristol. 
""Hopefully it doesn't escalate, and it doesn't become tit-for-tat leading to an outright war between two nuclear nations.
""Being an Indian myself, it's a concern for not only what is happening between India and Pakistan, but just generally the issues of war throughout the world at the moment.""
Local leaders in the west of England are also are urging communities not to spread misinformation online. 
""There's a lot of fake information and false news being spread around which doesn't help the situation,"" said Atiff Ghafar, vice chair of the Swindon Pakistan Association.
""So, we have been telling and encouraging our communities not to share unverified news reports.""
Pakistan says 36 people have been killed by Indian air strikes and firing. India says at least 16 people were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.
""As someone from the Pakistani diaspora, it's quite sad to see that there's tensions between both communities and innocent lives have been lost on both sides of the border,"" said Mr Ghafar.
""We don't want anything to be spreading across to this part of the world as we have very good cordial and friendly relationships with our Indian diaspora community who have lived with us side by side for a good 50 to 60 years.""
On 29 April, an interfaith and intercultural meeting was organised in Bristol by the International Human Rights Movement (HRM), Bristol Pakistani Forum and the Bristol Multi-Faith forum.
Rana Basharat Ali Khan, chairman of the HRM, said: ""It's so horrible to witness something like this in the 21st Century.
""It is not something we want to witness in this age, while we are fighting for justice.
""We need to change our priorities - we need to focus and invest on humans rather than defence and we need to come off this war affected mentality.""
Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency which has claimed thousands of lives.
Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.
The countries have fought two wars over the area.
Following the 22 April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, a Hindu prayer vigil was held on 27 April at the Hindu Garden of Peace in Gloucester to remember the victims of the deadly attack.
Speaking to the BBC Radio Gloucestershire at the vigil, Manish Jani said: ""It is something horrific against humanity, not just against one country."" 
Hema Patel echoed those emotions: ""Many people were killed, including Christians and Muslims. This is not about condemning any religion; we just pray for peace."" 
Dr Ashok and Dr Pravin Patel, co-chairs of the Hindu Cultural Association, both emphasised unity and empathy over division. 
""The first religion is humanity,"" said Dr Pravin. ""Any heinous act by one human on another is a blot on humanity.""
Atiff Ghafar, vice chair of the Swindon Pakistan Association, is encouraging communities to maintain peace
The Indian government says its forces have launched ""Operation Sindoor"", ""hitting terrorist infrastructure"" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir ""from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed"".
In a statement, the Indian government said that ""nine sites have been targeted"".
""Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution.""
The statement adds that the attack was ordered after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.

Sweden's new national security adviser quit hours after taking up the role as sensitive pictures of him on the dating app Grindr were sent anonymously to the government.
Tobias Thyberg, who took up the job on Thursday and resigned on Friday morning, had omitted the information during security background checks, the government said.
""These are old pictures from an account I previously had on the dating site Grindr. I should have informed about this, but I did not,"" he told newspaper Dagens Nyheter, external.
Thyberg had been due to be in Norway on Friday with the prime minister for a meeting of northern European leaders, but the adviser's participation was cancelled.
According to information provided to Swedish newspaper Expressen, external, the government received several images of a sexual nature from an anonymous sender.
It happened shortly after a press release announcing Thyberg taking up the national security adviser job had been issued.
On Friday Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the information should have come to light during the vetting process, according to Reuters.
""It is a systemic failure that this kind of information has not been brought forward,"" Kristersson told reporters in Oslo.
The resignation comes just months after Thyberg's predecessor in the high-profile job stepped down and was charged with negligent handling of classified information.
Henrik Landerholm announced his resignation in January as police opened an investigation after he allegedly left classified documents in an unlocked safe at a hotel during a conference.
In March Landerholm was charged with careless handling of secret information.
Prosecutors said in the indictment that Landerholm had through negligence disclosed ""information relating to conditions of a secret nature and whose disclosure to a foreign power could cause harm to Sweden's security"".

The head of Liberia's doctors' association has been banned from practising medicine after a regulatory body said it did not have evidence of his initial medical degree.
As part of a qualifications audit, the Liberia Medical and Dental Council (LMDC) asked Peter Matthew George to provide his professional certificates.
In April, the LMDC told Dr George that it had revoked his licence as he had not given satisfactory proof he had graduated in medicine from the UK's University of Hertfordshire as, it said, he had been claiming.
Dr George has disputed the LMDC's findings. He told the BBC there was a ""bias"" against him because of his advocacy in a row between doctors and the government. 
In a letter to Dr George explaining its decision, the LMDC said he had not provided an actual certificate of his qualification from the University of Hertfordshire but instead sent an ""award verification letter"" which said he had ""obtained an MD"". 
The LMDC pointed out that ""MD"" is a qualification acquired in the US and not the UK.
Furthermore, the LMDC said ""of utmost concern is that investigation showed that the only University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom does not currently offer a medical degree"".
The university told the BBC that ""following a thorough review of our academic records, we can confirm that there is no evidence that this individual was ever awarded any degree by the University nor studied here. Any claim to the contrary is therefore false and constitutes a misrepresentation of our institution.
""We are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities in Liberia and will continue to support any investigations as required.""
In his education record on LinkedIn, Dr George said he had studied for a ""professional doctorate in medicine MD, general medicine"" at Hertfordshire between 2010 and 2014. His LinkedIn page has since been taken down.
But in an email to the BBC, Dr George said his primary medical degree was not from the British university. ""I never told anyone so. Those are make-up stories,"" he wrote.
Asked why he had mentioned the University of Hertfordshire, he said: ""Maybe I made an error when writing because am under pressure.""
Instead, he said his initial medical degree was from the University of Central Nicaragua.
He said that since starting practising medicine in Liberia in 2014, and providing his qualifications to the authorities at the time, no-one had raised an issue with his work.
In fact, he said, he had been promoted and praised for improving the medical facilities at the Chief Jallah Lone Government Hospital in Gbarpolu county.
""I have served the Liberian health sector diligently for over a decade with no record of misconduct,"" he said.
Dr George argued that problems started to arise once he became the president of the Liberia Medical and Dental Association (LMDA) in December last year.
He said he was continuing ""the long-standing advocacy for the rights and welfare of doctors and dentists in the country"" and said hostility against him began after the LMDA raised issues with the ""reclassification of all government-employed specialists and consultants"".
The news that he had been barred from the profession has only just emerged as Dr George was given 15 working days to respond. The medical council said it did not receive a response.
In a statement, the LMDA said it had now ""nullified"" his presidency and that he was no longer a member of the association.

Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin make it look like they're the best of friends.
Xi took his place at the right-hand side of Putin, the position of a steadfast ally, as their troops marched together on Red Square as part of Moscow's Victory Day parade.
Hours earlier, Xi described the bond between the two countries as ""unbreakable"" and added that Russia and China should be ""friends of steel"".
This is Xi's 11th visit to Russia since becoming president in 2013 and the two leaders have met on more than 40 occasions. 
Putin has already announced plans to visit China in the autumn and the two leaders have even, in the past, shared a rare public hug.
But there is more to this relationship than meets the eye.
""We see a lot of exchanges between the two men and patriotic displays of togetherness,"" said Mathieu Boulegue, from the Center for European Policy Analysis.
""They can be friends on one end or co-operating on one end and then ripping each other apart on others, and actually be competitors in certain aspects of their relationship.
""We get wowed by the symbolism. There's a lot of performance around this relationship. But it's interesting to look at the real substance.""
Putin and Xi no longer have a partnership of equals
China is the true power in Putin and Kim Jong Un's budding friendship
In truth, President Xi is walking a very fine line. Russia is an important partner for China but Putin's invasion of Ukraine has made him an international pariah in much of the world.
Beijing needs to be careful that its friendship with Moscow doesn't isolate other prospective partners, especially as it is fighting an economic war with the United States.
China has been courting Europe for several months and stepped up its campaign after Donald Trump became US president.
Beijing has been keen to portray itself as a stable alternative global partner in contrast to an unpredictable White House in Washington.

Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US
There were some signs earlier this week that these diplomatic overtures were working.
Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, and AntÃ³nio Costa, the president of the European Council, exchanged messages on Tuesday with President Xi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang to celebrate the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations.
The BBC's Vitaly Shevchenko looks at three things we learned from Putin's Red Square parade
The stumbling block of any prospective partnership has been Beijing's close-knit relationship with Moscow and its economic support for Russia. China has not condemned its ""old friend"" for the invasion and instead calls for an end to the ""crisis"".
If President Xi appears to stand too close to Putin, it could cause friction with Europe at a time when it is looking for friendship.
But the Chinese leader has another key message to send.
Trump's initial attempts to end the war in Ukraine had him touting his close personal relationship with Putin. It prompted analysts to ask if Washington was trying to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing.
Xi will want to make it clear to Trump this is not possible.
""Together, we must foil all schemes to disrupt or undermine our bonds of amity and trust,"" Xi wrote in a signed article for Russian media. 
The Russian and Chinese leaders also described Trump's plans for a ""Golden Dome"" missile defence shield over the US as ""deeply destabilising"", and argued that it would weaponise space.
Both leaders are keen to present their vision of an alternative world order in the face of what they believe is US hegemony.
But Xi will be aware that while China is a superpower â Russia's power is now limited. This is no longer a partnership of equals.
President Xi and President Putin were joined by other world leaders as they observed the military parade
The war in Ukraine has weakened Russia's economy and depleted its arsenal and army. 
Western sanctions have also left Moscow far more reliant on Beijing for economic survival. They have severely weakened the Kremlin on the world stage.
""Russia needs China much more than the opposite is true,"" Boulegue said. 
Moscow will need to ""suck it up"", he added.
Putin may lean into his friend as they watch the tanks roll through Red Square and they can team up when they need each other.
But behind the bold statements, the smiles, handshakes and the occasional hug, there are potential sources of discord and disharmony which could surface in the years to come."

Leo said he had been elected to be a ""faithful administrator"" of a Church that would act as a ""beacon that illuminates the dark nights of this world"".
The ascension of Robert Francis Prevost has been celebrated by the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, with joyous outbursts in his US homeland and in Peru, where he served for 20 years.
In his sermon on Friday, the new Pope said there were many settings where the Christian faith was considered ""absurd"" - with power, wealth, and technology dominating - but it was precisely there that missionary outreach was needed.
""A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,"" he said in the address delivered in Italian.
Pope Leo, 69, wore a white papal robe trimmed in gold as he addressed the seated cardinals in the Sistine Chapel, an event broadcast live by the Vatican administration.
In an unscripted introduction before the homily, Leo also called on Church unity  from his cardinals, telling them in American-accented English: ""I know I can rely on each and every one of you to walk with me"".

Following weeks of anticipation, the previously-unknown Prevost was introduced as the new Pope to the world on Thursday evening in St Peter's Square.
Tens of thousands of worshippers in the square burst into cheers when white smoke curled out of the Vatican's chimney on the second day of the conclave's voting. 
Shortly after, the Chicago-born Prevost appeared on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica. In his first words to the crowds he outlined a vision of a ""missionary"" Church which ""builds bridges, which holds dialogues, which is always open"".

He echoed his predecessor, the late Pope Francis, in calling for peace.
""Help us, and each other, to build bridges through dialogue, through encounter, to come together as one people, always in peace,"" he said.
World leaders have rushed to congratulate Prevost on his election, pledging to work with him on global issues amid uncertain times. US President Donald Trump called it a ""great honour"" to have the first American pope.
The first North American pope delivering his inaugural homily on Friday 
Prevost, who had previously been the Bishop of Chiclayo in Peru, was only made an archbishop and then cardinal in 2023. He was elected by his fellow cardinals in what is believed to be four rounds of voting in the secret conclave that took place two weeks after Francis died.
He is seen as being aligned with the progressive late Pope, who was viewed as a champion of human rights and the poor and celebrated for his charismatic style that sought to make the Catholic Church more outward-facing.
Vatican watchers have noted that Francis appeared to have brought Prevost to Rome in recent years, perhaps to set him up as a potential successor. 
The Augustinian missionary worked for decades with the poor and marginalised in Peru, where he obtained nationality in 2015.
In his previous role as Cardinal Prevost, he had also expressed or amplified criticism of the US administration under President Trump, including its anti-immigration policies.
On an X account under his name, he had criticised Vice President JD Vance in February. Vance, who is a Catholic convert, had said Christians should love their family, neighbours, community and fellow citizens in that order. Prevost had written: ""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others"".
As Pope now, he faces a momentous task in leading the Church in a time of significant global conflicts. Observers have expressed hope that he can offer a counterpoint to more divisive voices on the world stage.
His next appearances, at Sunday's midday Regina Coeli prayer in St Peter's Basilica and a Monday news conference with journalists, will be closely watched for signs as to which direction he intends to lead the Church and what kind of Pope he will be."

Zambia says it has acted to halt the ""systematic theft"" of medical donations, after the US announced it was pulling the plug on $50m (Â£37m) of health sector funding to the country.
Malaria, HIV and TB treatment will become scarcer as a result of the US's decision.
But Zambia's Health Minister Elijah Muchima says there is ""no immediate risk of shortages"", and that 75% of the population can readily access essential drugs.
""We are no longer willing to underwrite the personal enrichment of fraudsters or the corrupt when patients go without or have to buy life-saving medications that we have provided for free,"" US Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said on Thursday.
In response, Zambia's health minister Muchima thanked the US for its ""generous support"" but said the problem of theft predated the current government which took office in 2021.
He also said several Zambian officials had been sacked following the thefts identified by the US, and that ""an advanced digital stock tracking system"" had been set up to help monitor supplies of medicines.
The US cuts are separate to the sweeping foreign aid freeze announced by President Donald Trump in January.  
According to the US' ambassador, the ""difficult"" decision to cut funding was taken after repeated warnings to the Zambian government to safeguard vital drugs meant for the country's most vulnerable patients.

US cuts send South Africa's HIV treatment 'off a cliff'
The US accounts for about a third of public health spending in Zambia, according to a statement from the US embassy in the country.
But US officials said they had discovered the ""country-wide theft"" of medical products that were intended to be distributed for free to the public and were now being sold by private pharmacies.
More than 2,000 pharmacies across Zambia were found selling donated drugs and medical supplies in a year-long investigation conducted by the US embassy.
""Shockingly, across these visits, 95 percent of the pharmacies that were selling the kinds of products that the United States provides, were also selling stolen goods,"" the statement said. 
Nearly half of the pharmacies visited were found selling medication and supplies donated by the US government, it said. 
Other pharmacies were also selling stolen medical stocks purchased by the Zambian government, the Global Fund, and other donor, it added. 
The US embassy said it had presented its findings and offered experts to help stop further theft and bring the culprits to justice in April last year but no action was taken. 
""I regret that to date, the government's actions have fallen drastically short of demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding US assistance and the lives we aim to save,"" the embassy said. 
Zambia's law enforcement operations have focused on ""low-level actors"" and have led to the arrest of ""only a few mid-level officials"" instead of investigating supply sources and pursuing the masterminds behind the theft of medicines, according to the US embassy. 
Gonzales said the US ""can no longer justify to the American taxpayer continuing to provide such massive levels of assistance"".
He said the cuts would affect drugs to treat malaria, HIV and TB. 
""This is not a decision we have taken lightly,"" Gonzales said, shedding tears as he explained how the measure would affect Zambian patients. 

US Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales says the decision is ""difficult"" but necessary 
The aid cuts will take effect January next year to give the Zambian government time to develop alternative arrangements but he said ""the decision had been made"". 
Since the Trump administration took office, it has cut billions of dollars in global health programmes, hitting African countries including Zambia, where HIV remains a major threat especially for adolescents and young adults.
Trump announced the aid freeze on his first day in office in January in line with his ""America First"" foreign policy. 
The aid cuts have affected health programmes across Africa, including shipments of critical medical supplies, including HIV drugs.
The majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes, which provided health and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable nations, have since been terminated.
In March, Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema said Trump had ""slapped us on both cheeks"", saying it was time for his country to strengthen its treasury to procure its own medicines.

""He does have a good sense of humour,"" Father Donaghy said, remembering how the Pope had spoken at an Augustinian meeting in Rome.

Ukraine says it has uncovered a spy network being run by the Hungarian state to obtain intelligence about its defences near their shared border.
Ukraine's security service said it had detained two alleged Hungarian spies who it accused of gathering intelligence.
""For the first time in Ukraine's history, the Security Service has exposed a Hungarian military intelligence network that was conducting espionage activities to the detriment of our state,"" the SBU said.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the allegations ""should be treated carefully as propaganda until such time as we receive any details or official information"".
Speaking on the Hungarian ATV television channel, he said that ""anti-Hungarian propaganda is often employed in Ukraine... which often turns out to have no basis in fact"".
He did not directly deny the allegations but later on Friday, Szijjarto said two Ukrainian diplomats had been expelled from Budapest.
Hungary is a member of the European Union and Nato - both firm allies of Ukraine - but Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly sided with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. 
The alleged spy network was established by Hungary's military intelligence with the aim of collecting data about the location and number of air defence systems, as well as law enforcement officers and their vehicles, in the western Zakarpattia region, the SBU said.
Zakarpattia is the western region of Ukraine that shares an 84-mile (137km) border with Hungary.
The spies had also been gathering information on the public sentiment among local residents to predict their response in the event of a Hungarian incursion, according to the SBU.
The SBU gave no indication that the alleged plot was in aid of Russia.
The woman and man who were detained - referred to by the SBU as ""traitors"" - were former members of the Ukrainian military and were allegedly being supervised by a Hungarian intelligence officer.
The SBU said the male suspect had crossed the border into Hungary to report to his controller, receiving money and a communication device in return. The SBU did not elaborate on how the purported network was uncovered.
The alleged spies were taken into custody at their homes, Ukrainian news agency Interfax reported, and phones and other evidence which indicated they were spies were seized during a search.
The detainees are suspected of treason and face up to life imprisonment.
Relations between Hungary and Ukraine have been strained since Russia's full-scale invasion began more than three years ago.
Orban has attempted to block EU aid packages to Ukraine, opposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas, and has voiced his opposition to Ukraine joining the EU.
Hungary has been a member of Nato, the transatlantic defence alliance, since 1999. But since Orban's rise to power as an authoritarian leader, its policies have often been at odds with Western positions.
Orban's government is among few in Europe that has maintained close ties to Russia following the invasion.
Taken in isolation, these arrests and the alleged espionage network involved amount to a relatively minor event. 
Ukraine's short border with Hungary is far from the front lines, and this has little bearing on the ongoing fighting in the south-east and north-east of the country, where Russia controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory.
But Russia, which uses missiles and drones to target all parts of Ukraine at intermittent intervals, would be keen to know the locations of any military assets.
Former UK Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that this was not the first time Ukraine had accused Hungary of subversive activity on its territory. 
But he added that the sensitive military nature of the alleged targets this time made it far more serious.
Wallace raised the question of who would be the ultimate recipient of this intelligence allegedly gathered from inside Ukraine's borders.
""What Putin fears most is Nato's values,"" he said. ""And if those values are threatened or undermined, then there needs to be some serious discussion within Nato about members that behave that way.""
The SBU's announcement also comes the same day that Robert Fico, the prime minister of another Nato nation, Slovakia, is in Moscow attending Vladimir Putin's showcase Victory Parade to commemorate the USSR's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War 2.
As the rest of Nato strives to maintain unity in the face of Russia's continuing invasion, this latest news will not be welcome.
Around 150,000 Hungarians live in Ukraine's Zakarpattia region, according to the last official census, taken in 2001.
Ukraine and Hungary have clashed in the past over the rights of this community to use their native language and Orban's efforts to promote Hungarian identity there.
Wallace said that when he was defence secretary, another plot was uncovered by Ukraine in which ""Hungarians were handing out passports to the ethnic Hungarians in that pocket of land"", prompting Kyiv to expel a number of diplomats."

The world's first drone war between nuclear-armed neighbours has erupted in South Asia.
On Thursday, India accused Pakistan of launching waves of drones and missiles at three military bases in Indian territory and Indian-administered Kashmir - an allegation Islamabad swiftly denied.
Pakistan claimed it had shot down 25 Indian drones in recent hours. Delhi remained publicly silent. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry, as both sides exchange not just artillery but unmanned weapons across a volatile border.
As Washington and other global powers urge restraint, the region is teetering on the edge of escalation, with drones -  silent, remote and deniable - opening a new chapter in the India-Pakistan conflict.
""The Indo-Pak conflict is moving into a new drone era - one where 'invisible eyes' and unmanned precision may determine escalation or restraint. Thus, in South Asia's contested skies, the side that masters drone warfare won't just see the battlefield - they'll shape it,"" Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Naval War College, told the BBC.
Follow our live updates
Since Wednesday morning, Pakistan says Indian air strikes and cross-border fire have killed 36 people and injured 57 more in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. On the other side, India's army reports at least 16 civilians dead from Pakistani shelling. India insists its missile barrage was retaliation for a deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month - an attack Islamabad denies any role in.
Pakistan's military announced on Thursday that it had shot down 25 Indian drones across various cities, including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. The drones - reportedly Israeli-made Harop drones - were reportedly intercepted using both technical and weapon-based countermeasures. India claimed to have neutralised several Pakistani air defence radars and systems, including one in Lahore, which Islamabad denied.  
Remnants of an Indian drone strike being inspected in Karachi on Thursday
Laser-guided missiles and bombs, drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become pivotal in modern warfare, significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of military operations. These can relay co-ordinates for airstrikes or, if equipped, directly laser-designate targets, and help immediate engagement. 
Drones can be used as decoys or suppression of enemy air defences, flying into contested airspace to trigger enemy radar emissions, which can then be targeted by other munitions like loitering drones or anti-radiation missiles. ""This is how Ukraine and Russia both do it in their war. This dual role - targeting and triggering - makes drones a force multiplier in degrading enemy air defences without risking manned aircraft,"" says Prof Matisek.
Experts say India's drone fleet is largely built around Israeli-made reconnaissance UAVs like the IAI Searcher and Heron, along with Harpy and Harop loitering munitions - drones that double as missiles, capable of autonomous reconnaissance and precision strikes. The Harop, in particular, signals a shift toward high-value, precision-targeted warfare, reflecting the growing importance of loitering munitions in modern conflict, experts say.
The Heron, say experts, is India's ""high-altitude eyes in the sky"" for both peacetime monitoring and combat operations. The IAI Searcher Mk II is designed for frontline operations, offering up to 18 hours of endurance, a range of 300km (186 miles), and a service ceiling of 7,000m (23,000ft). 
While many believe India's combat drone numbers remain ""modest"", external, a recent $4bn deal to acquire 31 MQ-9B Predator drones - which can can fly for 40 hours and up to an altitude of 40,000ft - from the US marks a major leap in its strike capabilities. 
India is also developing swarm drone, external tactics - deploying large numbers of smaller UAVs to overwhelm and saturate air defences, allowing higher-value assets to penetrate, say experts.
Pakistan's drone fleet is ""extensive and diverse"", comprising both indigenous and imported systems, Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst told the BBC.
He said the inventory includes ""over a thousand drones"", featuring models from China, Turkey and domestic manufacturers. Notable platforms include the Chinese CH-4, the Turkish Bayraktar Akinci, and Pakistan's own Burraq and Shahpar drones. Additionally, Pakistan has developed loitering munitions, enhancing its strike capabilities. 
Security forces inspect area after an Indian drone strike on Karachi on Thursday
Mr Haider said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has been actively integrating unmanned systems into its operations for nearly a decade. A key focus is the development of ""loyal wingman"" drones - unmanned aerial vehicles designed to operate in co-ordination with manned aircraft, he added.
Prof Matisek believes ""Israel's technical assistance, supplying Harop and Heron drones, has been pivotal for India, while Pakistan's reliance on Turkish and Chinese platforms highlights an ongoing arms race"".
While the recent drone exchanges between India and Pakistan mark a significant escalation in their rivalry, they differ markedly from the drone-centric warfare observed in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, experts say. There, drones become central to military operations, with both sides deploying thousands of UAVs for surveillance, targeting and direct attacks.
""Deploying drones [in the ongoing conflict] instead of fighter jets or heavy missiles represents a lower-level military option. Drones are less heavily armed than manned aircraft, so in one sense, this is a restrained move. However, if this is merely a prelude to a broader aerial campaign, the calculus changes entirely,"" Manoj Joshi, an Indian defence analyst, told the BBC.
Ejaz Haider believes the recent drone activity in Jammu ""appears to be a tactical response to immediate provocations, not a full-scale retaliation [by Pakistan]"". 
""A true retaliatory strike against India would involve shock and awe. It would likely be more comprehensive, involving multiple platforms - both manned and unmanned - and targeting a broader range of objectives. Such an operation would aim to deliver a decisive impact, signalling a significant escalation beyond the current tit-for-tat exchanges,"" Mr Haider says.

Indian Army personnel secure missile debris discovered in Amritsar's border villages 
While drones have fundamentally reshaped the battlefield in Ukraine, their role in the India-Pakistan conflict remains more limited and symbolic, say experts. Both countries are using their manned air forces to fire missiles at one another as well.
""The drone warfare we're witnessing may not last long; it could be just the beginning of a larger conflict,"" says Mr Joshi.
""This could either signal a de-escalation or an escalation - both possibilities are on the table. We're at an inflection point; the direction we take from here is uncertain.""
Clearly India is integrating drones into its precision-strike doctrine, enabling stand-off targeting without crossing borders with manned aircraft. However, this evolution also raises critical questions.
""Drones lower the political and operational threshold for action, providing options to surveil and strike while trying to reduce escalation risks,"" says Prof Matisek.
""But they also create new escalation dynamics: every drone shot down, every radar blinded, becomes a potential flashpoint in this tense environment between two nuclear powers."""

The 69-year-old is the first American to become a pontiff and will lead members of the Catholic Church's global community of 1.4bn people.
Born in Chicago, he is seen as a reformer and worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.
He also has Peruvian nationality and is fondly remembered as a figure who worked with marginalised communities and helped build bridges in the local Church.
One of the first acts of a new pope is to choose a new name, changing their baptismal one.
The decision is part of a longstanding tradition but it has not always been like that.
For more than 500 years, popes used their own names.
This then changed to symbolic names in order to simplify their given names or to refer to previous pontiffs.
Profile: Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?
Analysis: Continuity the key for Pope seen as unifier in the Church
Over the years, popes have often chosen the names of their immediate or distant predecessors out of respect or admiration and to signal the desire to follow in their footsteps and continue the most relevant pontificates.
For example, Pope Francis said his name honoured St Francis of Assisi, and that he was inspired by his Brazilian friend Cardinal Claudio Hummes.
Americans showed their joy at the election of the first pope from the US 
The new Pope has not yet specified why he has decided to be known as Pope Leo XIV.
There could be many reasons for it, but the name Leo has been used by many popes over the years.
Pope Leo I, also known as St Leo the Great, was pontiff between 440 and 461 AD.
He was the 45th pope in history and became known for his commitment to peace.
According to legend, the miraculous apparition of Saints Peter and Paul during the meeting between Pope Leo I and Attila the king of the Huns in 452 AD made the latter desist from invading Italy.
The scene was then depicted by Raphael in a fresco.
Pope Leo XIII was known for his dedication to social justice
The last pope to choose the name Leo was Pope Leo XIII, an Italian whose baptismal name was Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci.
Elected in 1878, he was the 256th occupant of the throne of St Peter and led the Catholic Church until his death in 1903.
He is remembered as a pope who was dedicated to social policies and social justice.
He is particularly known for issuing an encyclical - a letter sent to bishops of the Church - called ""Rerum Novarum"", a Latin expression which means ""Of New Things"".
The encyclical included topics such as workers' rights and social justice.
Leo is among some of the most popular papal names.
The most commonly used name has been John, first chosen in 523 by Saint John I, Pope and martyr. 
The last pope to choose this name was Italian Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, elected Pope John XXIII in 1958, who was proclaimed Saint by Pope Francis in 2014."

Smiling, he continued: ""A greeting to all and in particular to my dear Diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru.""
The first American pope is a citizen of Peru and has spent much of his life there, travelling between the two countries for decades until 2014, when Pope Francis appointed him bishop of the Chiclayo Diocese in the country's north.
On Thursday, Peruvians rejoiced at the appointment of one of their own to the highest position in the Catholic Church.
Standing near Lima's cathedral shortly after bells rang out in celebration of the appointment, elementary school teacher Isabel Panez said: ""For us Peruvians, it is a source of pride that this is a pope who represents our country.""
Prevost would often say that he had ""come from Chicago to Chiclayo â the only difference is a few letters,"" Diana Celis, who attended several Masses officiated by the then Bishop Robert Prevost, told the Associated Press news agency.
He reportedly referred to Peru, where around three quarters of people are Catholic, as ""mi segunda patria"" â my second homeland.

Pope Leo XIV marks new beginning for Catholic Church
Continuity the key for Pope seen as unifier in the Church
Who is the new pope, Robert Prevost?
Born in Chicago in 1955, he is the son of Louis Marius Prevost, of French and Italian descent, and Mildred Martinez, of Spanish descent.
After completing studies in theology in Chicago and in canon law in Rome, the Catholic Church sent him to Peru for the first time. 
He arrived at the Augustinian mission in Chulucanas, in the Peruvian department of Piura, in 1985, aged 30, and the following year, joined the mission in Trujillo. For almost three decades, he worked between the US and Peru. 
Then, in 2014, Pope Francis appointed Prevost bishop of Chiclayo, a position he assumed the following year, after becoming a Peruvian citizen.  
Jose Luis Perez Guadalupe, who was the minister responsible for signing Prevost's naturalisation, told BBC Mundo that he was ""a very attentive and very thoughtful man, who listened more than he spoke.""
These were his first encounters with a country that would come to shape his life. 
People celebrate at the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Chiclayo, Peru with a banner saying Pople XIV has a Chiclayo heart. 
Janinna Sesa, who met Prevost while she worked for the church's Caritas nonprofit, told the Associated Press during torrential rains in 2022 he waded through mud to help people in Chiclayo and nearby villages.
He also delivered food and blankets to remote Andean villages, driving a white pickup truck and sleeping on a thin mattress on the floor. There, Sesa said, Prevost ate whatever was offered to him, including the peasant diet consisting of potatoes, cheese and sweet corn. 
But, if the opportunity came up, he would enjoy carne asada â one of his favorite dishes â accompanied by a glass of Coca-Cola.
He also had an interest in cars. ""He has no problem fixing a broken-down truck until it runs,"" Sesa said. 
Prevost was the driving force for the purchase of two oxygen-production plants during the coronavirus pandemic, which killed more than 217,000 people across Peru.
""He worked so hard to find help, that there was not only enough for one plant, but for two oxygen plants,"" Sesa said.
Edinson FarfÃ¡n, the Peruvian Bishop of Chiclayo since 2024, said Pope Leo would continue Pope Francis's legacy of working with the poor and advocating for ""a Church with open doors"". He was ""very close to Pope Francis"", he said. 
""He was undoubtedly deeply influenced by this particular Church of Chiclayo. Chiclayo is a city that greatly values the simple faith of its people. He has a special affection for the diocese.""
""It's his beloved diocese, it's his life. He learned here everything he can share and will share with the entire world.""

But not all in the country are proud of his record.  
Serious accusations have been made about his handling of sexual abuse cases during his time as Bishop of Chiclayo. 
In 2023, three Peruvian women went public with claims that as bishop he failed to investigate their reports of having been abused as teenagers by two priests in Chiclayo, dating back to 2007. They said that when they raised their allegations with the diocese in 2022, no proper inquiry was opened.
Church officials in Chiclayo said that action was taken and the accused priests were put on precautionary suspension, and that the case was referred to the Vatican's Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which handles serious abuse cases.
The diocese said it was Rome's decision to shelve the case without a full canonical trial and that it conducted a preliminary investigation.
These allegations about his leadership are one of the challenges he will face as he now heads the Church worldwide.
A mass at Las Nazarenas Church, in Lima, Peru, 8 May 2025.
Perez Guadalupe said that while Prevost primarily remained focused on church matters in Peru, he was ""very attentive to the reality"" of the country.  
In 2023, when violent anti-government protests following the ousting of then-president Pedro Castillo left 49 dead, Prevost told Peruvian media he felt ""much sorrow and much pain"". 
That year, Pope Francis called Prevost to Rome to serve as the prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, the powerful head of the office that vets bishop nominations from around the world and one of the most important jobs in the Catholic Church. He was also appointed president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. 
Prevost said that he had asked Pope Francis to allow him to remain in Peru longer.
As he heard Prevost was the new pope, Thomas Nicolini, a Peruvian who studies economics in Rome, went to St Peter's Square. 
He told the AP that Chiclayo is, ""A beautiful area, but one of the regions that needs lots of hope."" 
""So, now I'm expecting that the new pope helps as many people as possible, and tries to reignite, let's say, the faith young people have lost."""

The fact that the conclave was over quickly suggests that from the outset, a significant number of the voting cardinals felt Robert Prevost was the one amongst them best equipped to take on the challenges a pope faces.
In the lead up to the election - during the formal meetings of cardinals, and the informal dinners and coffees they had to discuss the type of person they were looking for - it was apparent that two words kept coming up, ""continuity"" and ""unity"".
There was a recognition among many that Pope Francis had started something hugely impactful, through reaching out to those living on the margins of society, to those on the peripheries of the Catholic world and also to those outside the faith.
Pope Leo XIV's first speech in full
Pope Leo's first public address from the Vatican balcony - watch in full
Who is the new pope, Robert Prevost?
There was appreciation for his endeavour to become a voice for the voiceless and focus on the poor and those whose destinies were not in their own hands.
But there was also a sense that work had to be done to resolve the (sometimes very public) splits between those of different schools of thought within the Church hierarchy, often characterised as traditionalist and progressive.
It was in that context that Robert Prevost's name started to be talked of as a serious contender. As someone who supported Pope Francis behind the scenes, but who different factions could still think of as one of their own.
But the voting cardinals had been tasked by the Church with considering not just what the institution and Catholic believers needed, but also what humanity needed at a difficult juncture, with war and division the backdrop.
Again, Cardinal Prevost - the US-Peruvian dual national, who was talked of as feeling as at home with his North American peers as he was with Latin American colleagues - was seen as someone who, as pope, could connect different worlds.
Pope Francis was sometimes criticised for lacking an ability to win more allies in the US on the big issues of migration, climate change and inequality, because of a disconnect in understanding the most effective ways of communicating his arguments to them.
For those who had in their minds that the primary requirement being sought of a new pope was an ability to bring ""continuity"" and ""unity"", during his speech on St Peter's balcony, Leo XIV gave strong clues as to why the cardinals chose him.
In his talk of ""building bridges"" and people globally being ""one people"" he evoked echoes of Pope Francis and also talked of unity at its fullest.
In these early days, his past will be heavily scrutinised.  His political views examined, his track record on dealing with abuse dissected, and his comments over the years on social issues charted.
Much of this is already in the public domain so it can only be assumed that the cardinal electors felt there was nothing of enough consequence to impair his ability to lead the Catholic Church and be the global moral voice they were looking for.
Huge challenges lie ahead. But with resolution after just four conclave votes, he starts out with a strong mandate from the men he will need the most through his papacy."

Hours into the ceasefire Russia had called for, we drove into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine to see what, if any, impact it was having.
The Ukrainian military escorted us to an artillery position, south-west of the fiercely contested city of Pokrovsk. 
Overcast skies made the drive through mud tracks running past wide open fields slightly less vulnerable to attacks from drones.
Russian President Vladimir Putin had proposed a three-day ceasefire starting at midnight local time on 8 May, to coincide with the anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe â a public holiday in Russia on Friday known as Victory Day.
But from the artillery position we heard the sounds of continuous explosions â incoming and outgoing mortar fire -  evidence that there was no ceasefire in the trenches and on the frontlines.
I asked Serhii, one of the soldiers of the 3rd Operational Brigade of the National Guard if there had been any attacks from Russia overnight.
""Yes, they have been attacking overnight. We have had glide bombs and drones here. Russia can't be trusted. In the evening they call a truce and in the morning they attack. There is no truce. We are always prepared for anything,"" he said.
Some minutes later, he was sent the co-ordinates of a target over the radio. A few soldiers ran through deep muddy trenches, to a clearing where a howitzer was hidden from sight, covered by branches and leaves. They uncovered it, pointed it in the right direction and fired. It let out a deafening sound, and the recoil blew up leaves and dust from the ground.
Serhii, a soldier in the 3rd Operational Brigade of the National Guard, told the BBC ""there is no truce.""
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had rejected Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire. Instead, he has called for a longer 30-day truce, as proposed by the US, a proposal that has once again been reiterated by its President Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform on Thursday night. 
Trump has even threatened that Washington and its partners would impose further sanctions if the ceasefire is not respected.
As the war of attrition grinds on, each side trying to wear the other down, I asked, Max, a 26-year-old soldier how he felt about global diplomatic efforts pushing for a ceasefire.
""You don't think about things like that when you are here. You have to have 'tunnel vision'. You can't let emotions dictate your actions. You wait for a command and act, and if there is no command you find a way to spend your time. But you don't let thoughts like this enter your mind,"" he said.
We drive north from the artillery position, to the city of Dobropillya, which is roughly 12 miles (19km) from Russian positions. Thousands of people still live in the city, among them are many of those who've been forced to move here because their home towns have become too dangerous to live in.

Svitlana, who has relocated to Dobropillya from Pokrovsk, can hear the sound of explosions on the outskirts of the city.
We meet Svitlana who is from Pokrovsk but has now relocated to Dobropillya. I asked her if she thought Russia's ceasefire call had made any difference on the ground. ""You can hear the sounds here,"" she said, referring to the continuous sounds of explosion, like rolling thunder, that we could hear from the outskirts of the city. ""That is the sound of Russia's ceasefire. That's why I say we should never trust them.""
Twenty-six-year-old Serhiy chimes in: ""The ceasefire is announced just to confuse people and deceive them, and so they (Russia) can say to the world 'we are so good, we are trying to get Ukraine through peaceful means' but in reality, everything they do is the opposite of it.""
In Dobropillya's main market, we meet 65-year-old Oleksandr. ""It was quieter last night. Before that we used to hear Shahed drones flying regularly,"" he said. ""But now we are hearing alarms again, and I'm not sure I can see any truce.""
As he talks, his face crumples into a sob. ""I'm afraid. I have my wife and son here. I'm very scared for my family. I'm scared we might be forced to flee our homes,"" he said, breaking down.
Dobropillya is roughly 12 miles or 20km from Russian positions.

575,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8dnm4dv2zo,2025-05-09 01:19:49,"How good is the UK trade pact for America?,","When President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping taxes on imports from around the world last month, he said the measures aimed to right America's trade relationships. 
In his new pact with the UK, we got a glimpse of the kind of agreements he might seek to negotiate across the globe. 
Both the US and UK have so far offered limited details about the new trade deal, which both say is still being worked out in the weeks ahead.  
But anyone hoping the White House will either significantly roll back its tariffs - or win major concessions abroad - seem bound for disappointment. 

Under the outline presented on Thursday, the 10% import tax that Trump announced last month on most UK goods will remain intact. 
Otherwise, the plans mostly amounted to the White House agreeing to walk back some of the import taxes it has unveiled on strategic sectors, such as cars and steel.
In exchange, the White House said it had won changes - which were unspecified - that would expand opportunities for sales of American beef, ethanol and other agricultural products in the UK. 
""The actual substantive items that they negotiated are pretty narrow,"" said Stan Veuger, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. ""In some sense you could say they basically took the status quo, made marginal changes and called it a deal.""
US and UK agree deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metals
What is in the UK-US tariff deal?
What tariffs has Trump announced and why?
The Trump administration, which has seen markets panic at its tariff announcements, was eager to sell the announcement as significant, describing it as a ""breakthrough"".
In the UK, Sir Keir Starmer, who also has incentive to want to be seen as a solid negotiator, called it ""historic"", while noting there was more work to be done.
Steelmakers and car firms in the UK did express relief, saying the tariff rollback would help save jobs. 
But it was hardly missed on anyone that despite progress, goods from the UK are still facing higher tariffs than they were a few weeks ago. 
In the US, most analysts agreed that substantive benefits would be limited, despite the two sides discussing trade on and off for nearly a decade.
Mr Veuger noted that Trump in his first term was similarly willing to declare victory on deals with China, Mexico and Canada that experts likewise said would have narrow impact.
""I think for Trump the goal really is to have a deal and it doesn't really matter what it looks like in the substance, "" he said. ""It tells me it's not that hard to get to a deal but it also tells me there's not that much room to make changes.""
Thursday's announcements drew an unusually sharp rebuke from American carmakers, which noted that the plans made UK-made cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada. 
Other analysts pounced on the irony of the president dismissing concerns that tariffs are driving up prices for dolls while he agrees to lower taxes on imported cars for the ultra-wealthy like Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, which are UK companies. 
The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said it welcomed the deal but other groups representing farmers, a key part of Trump's political base, were notably muted.
The American Farm Bureau Federation called it an ""important first step"", while noting ""more work is needed"".
""This is a good deal for American farmers ... but it is at the end of the day a fairly narrowly-focused framework,"" said Lewis Lukens, former acting US Ambassador to the UK and deputy chief of mission to the US embassy in London during part of Trump's first term.
""It gives Trump a political victory with not too much really to show behind it.""
Republicans, traditionally a free-trade party, were quick to celebrate the achievement.
Rep Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska, who chairs a subcommittee on trade, told the BBC he was ""pleased"" over the initial trade pact. 
""This is a significant step toward eliminating barriers to American products in foreign markets and friendshoring supply chains,"" he said, commending the administration for the swift negotiations, though noting he was happy to see details of the deal were still being negotiated ""to address additional concerns"". 
In a note to clients after the press conference, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the announcement indicated ""rising desperation"" in the White House to ease its tariffs before they caused significant economic damage.
But those economic risks are coming not from the UK, but America's relationship with China, which sent more than $400bn worth of goods to the US last year, more than six times that of the UK. 
Trump has hiked import taxes on Chinese products to at least 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own duties on American goods. 
Trade traffic between the two countries has dropped precipitously since last month, raising fears that the tariffs will lead not only to price rises, as had been widely predicted, but shortages as well. 
The two sides are set to have their first talks this weekend, but what will come out of them remain unclear. 
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on a 90-day pause that Trump placed on some of the highest tariffs he had announced last month on partners such as the European Union, Vietnam and Cambodia.  
Earlier this week, Trump appeared testy when asked by reporters about his trade negotiations.
""Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?'"" he said. ""I wish they'd ... stop asking.""
But it seems unlikely that this announcement with the UK will be the one to get the critics off his back.

After the sorrow of death, the joy of a new beginning.
The warm May sun was still high in the sky when a roar echoed out in the streets surrounding St Peter's Square.
One street over, startled people looked at each other, then at their phones. Then, they began to run down the narrow alleyways leading to the Vatican. ""White smoke, they're saying white smoke!"", they called out.
By the time they reached the square, a white haze was still hovering over the left hand side of the Apostolic Palace where 133 cardinals had been locked away since the day before, voting to elect the new head of the Catholic Church.
As the evening sunshine streamed through the statues of the apostles on the ledge of St Peter's Basilica and bells tolled joyously over the square, young and older people zig-zagged through the crowd, and a group of nuns held hands as they swerved journalists and cameras.
LIVE UPDATES: Robert Prevost becomes first American pope 
Pope Leo's first public address from the Vatican balcony - watch in full
Who is the new pope, Robert Prevost?
It was less than three weeks ago that Pope Francis blessed the crowds from the balcony at St Peter's, and his memory hung over the square on Thursday; almost everyone asked to share their impressions mentioned Francis and the need for the new Pope to follow in his footsteps.
""We just arrived today from America,"" one woman named Amanda told the BBC. ""It feels like a blessing. We came here for this and here it is.""
""Divine timing!"" she joked. Two stylish women in their 20s said they were ""about to cry"". ""It's a historic moment, it's crazy,"" one said, adding she hoped the next Pope would be ""at least as good as the last one"".
This was a sentiment echoed by many in those last minutes before Pope Leo XIV was announced.
""It doesn't matter to us where he's from as long as he follows in on Francis' footsteps and creates unity for all of us Catholics,"" said a French woman as she herded her five children to get closer to the front of the square. 
By the time Dominique Mamberti - the proto-deacon tasked with delivering the iconic ""Habemus Papam"" address to the square - appeared on the balcony, St Peter's was full to the brim. It fell silent, though, once Robert Francis Prevost's name was read out.
Those in the know may have identified the Chicago-born 69-year-old cardinal - who worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made a bishop there â as a potential pontiff early on.
But many people in the square looked puzzled at first, and the complete lack of phone coverage meant that most couldn't look him up on the internet - so the first impression most got of Pope Leo XIV came down to the way he introduced himself from the ornate balcony.
Visibly moved at first, and dressed in white and red vestments and speaking in confident - if lightly accented - Italian, he read out a much lengthier speech than the remarks made by his predecessor Francis in 2013.
""I would like this greeting of peace to reach all your hearts and familiesâ¦ and people around the world. May peace be with you,"" the new Pope began as the square fell silent.
At other moments, his address was met with frequent warm applause, especially when he mentioned ""peace"" - which he did on nine occasions - and the late Francis.
A section of the speech delivered in Spanish in which Pope Leo XIV remembered his time in Peru was met with cheers from various pockets of South Americans dotted across the square.
He also insisted on the need for unity, and at the end asked everyone to join together in prayer. When he began reciting Ave Maria, a deep hum rose as the square followed suit, with some praying in their own languages.
Carla and Juan said this was their first trip to the Vatican
The crowd began to slowly amble out of the square shortly after. As people streamed past them, a young couple held each other close, beaming. ""I still have goosebumps,"" said Carla, from Barcelona.
""The energy is contagious, it's amazing - it's our first time here, and for me it's 100% surreal,"" said Juan, who is from Ecuador and had never been to the Vatican before. Asked what his hope for Pope Leo XIV was, he said: ""That the Holy Spirit guides him. I hope that means we can all be united together going forward.""
Gemma, a Rome resident, said she hadn't even heard the name Robert Prevost until she came across it on Instagram this morning. ""The reaction of the square wasn't that warm,"" her friend Marco added. 
""If he'd been Italian everyone would have kicked off."" ""But it was a beautiful evening, a beautiful occasion,"" said Gemma. ""It was my first conclave. And this new Pope is only 69, so who knows when the next one will be?""
The square emptied. The restaurants around the Vatican filled up with pilgrims, clergy, and tourists. Couples snapped the last selfies outside the basilica.
Over in the Apostolic Palace - now unsealed - Robert Prevost held a moment of private prayer.
Then, for the first time, he re-entered the Sistine Chapel as Leo XIV, the 267th Pope."

""To have the Pope from America is a great honour,"" Trump said when asked for reaction to the news.
Pope Leo, 69, was born in Chicago and attended university outside Philadelphia, before becoming a missionary in Peru. 
The US has the fourth largest number of Catholics in the world, and congratulations started pouring in soon after the first American pope's name was announced.

""I'm sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church,"" Vance wrote on X.
Former President Joe Biden, a devout Catholic who has spoken about his warm relationship with Pope Francis, also offered his congratulations.
""Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois,"" Biden, the second Catholic president in US history, wrote on social media. 
Former President Barack Obama, who launched his political career in Chicago, wrote on X: ""Michelle and I send our congratulations to a fellow Chicagoan, His Holiness Pope Leo XIV.""  
""This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith.""

""This an historic and hopeful moment for Catholics in America and for the faithful around the world,"" he said.
""We join those praying for the success of Pope Leo XIV as he prepares to lead the Catholic church, serve the neediest, and share God's love.""
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also congratulated the new pope and wrote on social media: ""May God bless the first American papacy in these historic days."" 
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a Catholic, also extended his congratulations.
""This is a moment of profound significance for the Catholic Church, offering renewed hope and continuity amid the 2025 Jubilee Year to over a billion faithful worldwide,"" Rubio said. 
""The United States looks forward to deepening our enduring relationship with the Holy See with the first American pontiff.""
As cardinal, it appears Prevost did not shy away from occasionally challenging the views of the Trump administration. 
An account under his name reposted a post on social media platform X which was critical of the Trump administration's deportation of a US resident to El Salvador, and shared a critical comment piece written about a TV interview given by Vance to Fox News.
""JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others,"" read the post, repeating the headline from the commentary on the National Catholic Reporter website.
The BBC has contacted the Vatican but has not independently confirmed the account, which was created in 2011, belongs to the new pontiff.

From a woman waving a colonial-era flag in a shopping mall, to bakery staff selling cakes with protest symbols on them - dozens of Hongkongers have been reported to the police by one man for what he believes were national security violations.
""We're in every corner of society, watching, to see if there is anything suspicious which could infringe on the national security law,"" former banker Innes Tang tells the BBC World Service. 
""If we find these things, we go and report it to the police.""
When the UK returned Hong Kong to China 28 years ago, internationally binding treaties guaranteed the city's rights and freedoms for 50 years. But the national security law (NSL), imposed by Beijing a year after Hong Kong's 2019 mass pro-democracy protests, has been criticised for scuttling free speech and press, and for ushering in a new culture of informing.
The law , externalcriminalises activities considered to be calls for ""secession"" (breaking away from China), ""subversion"" (undermining the power or authority of the government), and collusion with foreign forces.
An additional security law called Article 23, voted in last year, has further tightened restrictions. 
With new laws and arrests, there has been limited reporting on Hong Kong's pro-China ""patriots"", external - the people who are now running and policing the city, as well as the ordinary citizens who openly support them. But the BBC has spent weeks interviewing Innes Tang, 60, a prominent self-described patriot.
He and his volunteers have taken screen grabs from social media of any activities or comments they believe could be in breach of the NSL.
He also established a hotline for tip-offs from the public and encouraged his online followers to share information on the people around them.
Innes Tang has reported dozens of fellow Hongkongers to the police
Nearly 100 individuals and organisations have been reported to the authorities by him and his followers, he says.
""Does reporting work? We wouldn't do it if it didn't,"" Mr Tang says. ""Many had cases opened by the policeâ¦ with some resulting in jail terms.""
Mr Tang says he hasn't investigated alleged law breakers himself, but simply reported incidents he thinks warrant scrutiny - describing it as ""proper community-police co-operation"".
Mr Tang is not the only so-called patriot to engage in this kind of surveillance.
Hong Kong's authorities have set up their own national security hotline, receiving 890,000 tip-offs from November 2020 to February this year - the city's security bureau told the BBC.
For those who are reported to the authorities, pressure can be relentless.
Since the NSL was enacted in 2020, up until February this year, more than 300 people had been arrested for national security offences. And an estimated 300,000 or more Hongkongers have permanently left the city in recent years.
Pong Yat-ming, the owner of an independent bookshop that hosts public talks, says he often receives inspections from government departments which cite ""anonymous complaints"".
He received 10 visits in one 15-day period, he says.
Kenneth Chan, political scientist and university lecturer, who has been involved in the city's pro-democracy movement since the 1990s, jokes he has ""become a bit radioactive these days"".
Kenneth Chan says some friends and colleagues now avoid him 
Some friends, students and colleagues now keep their distance because of his outspoken views, he says. ""But I would be the last person to blame the victims. It's the system.""
In response, Hong Kong's government said it ""attaches great importance to upholding academic freedom and institutional autonomy"". But it adds that academic institutions ""have the responsibility to ensure their operations are in compliance with the law and meet the interests of the community at large"".
Innes Tang says he is motivated to report people by a love of Hong Kong, and that his views on China were cultivated when he was young, when the city was still a British colony.
""The colonial policies weren't really that great,"" he says. ""The best opportunities were always given to the British and we [the locals] did not really have access.""
Like many of his generation, he nursed a longing to be united with China and taken out of colonial governance. But he says many other Hongkongers at the time were more concerned with their livelihoods than their rights.
""Democracy or freedom. These were all very abstract ideas which we didn't really understand,"" he says.
An average citizen should not become too involved in politics, he says, explaining he only became politically active to restore what he calls ""balance"" to Hong Kong society following the turbulence of 2019.
He is giving a voice, he says, to what he calls ""the silent majority"" of Hongkongers who do not support independence from China, nor the disruption created by the protests.

But other Hongkongers consider rallies and demonstrations a longstanding tradition, and one of the only ways to voice public opinion in a city that now does not have a fully democratically elected leadership.
""We are no longer a city of protests,"" says Kenneth Chan, who specialises in Eastern European politics. ""So what are we? I don't have the answer yet.""
And patriotism isn't inherently a negative thing, he says.
It is ""a value, maybe even a virtue"", he argues, although it needs to allow citizens to keep ""a critical distance"" - something that is not happening in Hong Kong.
Electoral reform was pushed through in 2021 - stating that only ""patriots"" who ""swore loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party"" could hold important positions in government or the Legislative Council [LegCo] - Hong Kong's parliament.
As a result, the council struggles to function, believes Hong Kong-based China commentator Lew Mon-hung, a former member of the Chinese government advisory body, the CPPCC.
""The public think a lot of these patriots are 'verbal revolutionaries' or political opportunists - they don't really represent the people,"" he says.
""That's why ridiculous policies still pass with a huge majority. There is no-one to constrain or oppose, no-one to scrutinise.""
Even patriot Innes Tang says he wants to see the current system challenged.
""I don't want to see every policy passing with 90% of the vote,"" he tells the BBC.
There is a danger the National Security Law will be weaponised, he says, with people saying: ""If you don't agree with me, I accuse you of infringement of the national security law.""
""I don't agree with this type of stuff,"" says Mr Tang.
Hong Kong's government said: ""The improved LegCo is now rid of extremists who wish to obstruct and even paralyse the operation of the government without any intention of entering into constructive dialogue to represent the interests of all Hong Kong people.""
For now, says Mr Tang, he has stopped reporting on people. Balance and stability, he believes, has returned to Hong Kong.
The number of large-scale protests has dwindled to none at all.
In academia, fear of surveillance - and how life might change for someone who infringes the laws - means self-censorship and censorship have become the ""order of the day"", says Kenneth Chan.
Pro-democracy parties are no longer represented in the Legislative Council and many have disbanded - including the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, once the most powerful party.
In one promotional video, Mr Tang and his team show off banners - each represents a person or organisation they have reported to the police
Innes Tang has now set his sights overseas.
""There aren't any particular issues in Hong Kong now, so I asked myself - shouldn't I have a look at how I can continue to serve my community and my country?"" he says.
""For a non-politician and civilian like me, this is an invaluable opportunity.""
He now works as a representative for one of several pro-Beijing non-profit groups, regularly visiting the UN in Geneva to speak at conventions giving China's perspective on Hong Kong, human rights and other issues.
Mr Tang is also in the process of establishing a media company in Switzerland, and registering as a member of the press.
For Kenneth Chan in Hong Kong, his future hangs in the balance.
""One third of my friends and students are now in exile, another third of my friends and students are in jail, and I'm sort ofâ¦ in limbo,"" he says.
""Today I'm speaking freely with youâ¦ no-one would promise me that I would continue doing it for the rest of my life.""
In a written reply to the BBC, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said that national security is a top priority and inherent right for any country. It ""only targets an extremely small minority of people and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public""."

A judge declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the murder trial of a Michigan police officer who fatally shot a black man during a traffic stop.
Christopher Schurr was charged with second-degree murder for the killing of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on 4 April 2022. 
The killing of Mr Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant, sparked widespread protests and put the question of racial injustice and policing in the spotlight.
""It hurts. My family, my wife, we are bleeding,"" Mr Lyoya's father said after the judge declared mistrial on Thursday. ""We will continue to fight until we get the true justice for Patrick.""
The mistrial is a partial victory for Mr Schurr, who still could face another trial.
The 4 April incident was caught in graphic detail and from multiple angles on a police bodycam and dashboard camera, an eyewitness' phone and a doorbell security system from a nearby home. 
Footage shows Mr Lyoya fleeing from Mr Schurr on foot following a traffic stop. The two men scuffle over Mr Schurr's Taser before he shoots Mr Lyoya, who was face-down on the ground.
The scuffle over the Taser was central to Mr Schurr's defence, who testified that he was in great fear because a Taser can cause ""excruciating pain"" and injury.
""I believed that if I hadn't done it at that time, I wasn't going to go home,"" Mr Schurr said of shooting Mr Lyoya.
Mr Schurr, an officer in the Grand Rapids police department for seven years, was fired soon after he was charged in 2022.
Patrick Lyoya came to the US with his family from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2014. He had lived in Grand Rapids for about five years, according to the office of civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the Lyoya family.
The mistrial comes just one day after three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of  murder in the killing of Tyre Nichols, a black man who was beaten during a traffic stop in 2023."

India has accused Pakistan of attacking three of its military bases with drones and missiles, a claim which has been denied by Islamabad.
The Indian Army said it had foiled Pakistan's attempts to attack its bases inÂ Jammu and Udhampur, in Indian-administered Kashmir, and Pathankot, in India's Punjab state.
Blasts were reported on Thursday evening in Jammu city in Indian-administered Kashmir as the region went into a blackout.
Pakistan's defence minister told the BBC they were not behind the attack.
""We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,"" Khawaja Asif told the BBC, adding: ""We will not strike and then deny"".
Blasts were reported in the city of Jammu which went into a black-out
Earlier on Thursday, India said it had struck Pakistan's air defences and ""neutralised"" Islamabad's attempts to hit military targets in India on Wednesday night.
Pakistan called that action another ""act of aggression"", following Indian missile strikes on Wednesday on targets in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.
India's strikes on Wednesday sparked a chorus of calls for de-escalation from the international community with the UN and world leaders calling for calm. 
The attacks and incidents of shelling along the border have fanned fears of wider conflict erupting between the nuclear-armed states.
It is being viewed as the worst confrontation between the two countries in more than two decades.
India said it hit nine ""terrorist infrastructure"" sites on Wednesday in retaliation for  a militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.
Pakistan has strongly denied Indian claims that it backed the militants who killed 26 civilians in the mountainous town of Pahalgam.
It was the bloodiest attack on civilians in the region for years, sending tensions soaring. Most of the victims were Indian tourists.
Indian-administered Kashmir has seen a decades-long insurgency against Indian rule which has claimed thousands of lives.
Kashmir has been a flashpoint between the countries since they became independent after British India was partitioned in 1947. Both claim Kashmir and have fought two wars over it.
Locals in border areas have had to be evacuated due to the cross-border shelling - here women and children arrive at a shelter near Jammu
There were calls for restraint from around the world after India launched ""Operation Sindoor"" early on Wednesday.  
But on Thursday both sides accused each other of further military action.
Pakistan's military spokesman said drones sent by India had been engaged in multiple locations.
""Last night, India showed another act of aggression by sending drones to multiple locations,"" Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said. ""These locations are Lahore, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bahawalpur, Miano, Chor and near Karachi.""
He said one civilian had been killed in Sindh province and four troops injured in Lahore.
The US consulate in Lahore told its staff to shelter, external in the building. 
India said its latest action had been taken in response to Pakistan's attempts to ""engage a number of military targets in northern and western India"" overnight.
""It has been reliably learnt that an Air Defence system at Lahore has been neutralised,"" a Defence Ministry statement said. Pakistan denied the claim.
There was no independent confirmation of the two countries' versions of events.
Later in the day India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a news conference in Delhi: ""Our intention has not been to escalate matters, we are only responding to the original escalation.""
Meanwhile, casualty numbers continue to rise. Pakistan says 31 people have been killed and 57 injured by Indian air strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and firing along the Line of Control, since Wednesday morning.
India's army said the number of people killed by Pakistani firing in the disputed Kashmir region had risen to 16, including three women and five children.
India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam but on 7 May it accused the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group of carrying it out.
Indian police have alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, a claim denied by Islamabad. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.
In a late-night address on Wednesday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to avenge those killed in India's strikes.
He repeated Pakistan's claim that it had shot down five Indian fighter jets, saying that was a ""crushing response"". India has not commented on that claim.
Following the reports of Thursday's explosions in Jammu, local media cited Indian military sources on Thursday in reporting that blasts across the Jammu region were also reported in the towns of  Akhnoor, Samba and Kathua."

In his first address from the balcony of St Peter's Basilica on Thursday evening, Leo XIV spoke warmly about his predecessor and thanked the cardinals who had elected him to succeed the late Pope Francis.
Here is a translation of the speech which he delivered in Italian and Spanish:
Peace be with you. Dearest brothers and sisters, this was the first greeting of the risen Christ, the good shepherd who gave his life for the flock of God. I, too, would like this greeting of peace to enter your hearts, to reach your families and all people, wherever they are; and all the peoples, and all the earth: Peace be with you.
This is the peace of the Risen Christ, a disarming and humble and preserving peace. It comes from God. God, who loves all of us, without any limits or conditions. Let us keep in our ears the weak but always brave voice of Pope Francis, who blessed Rome - the Pope who blessed Rome and the world that day on the morning of Easter.
Allow me to continue that same blessing. God loves us, all of us, evil will not prevail. We are all in the hands of God. Without fear, united, hand in hand with God and among ourselves, we will go forward. We are disciples of Christ, Christ goes before us, and the world needs his light. Humanity needs him like a bridge to reach God and his love. You help us to build bridges with dialogue and encounter so we can all be one people always in peace.
Thank you Pope Francis.
Thank you to my cardinal brothers who chose me to be the successor of Peter and to walk together with you as a united Church searching all together for peace and justice, working together as women and men, faithful to Jesus Christ without fear, proclaiming Christ, to be missionaries, faithful to the gospel.
I am a son of Saint Augustine, an Augustinian. He said, ""with you I am a Christian, for you a bishop"". So may we all walk together towards that homeland that God has prepared for us.
To the Church of Rome, a special greeting:
We have to look together how to be a missionary Church, building bridges, dialogue, always open to receiving with open arms for everyone, like this square, open to all, to all who need our charity, our presence, dialogue, love.
(Speaking in Spanish)
Hello to all and especially to those of my diocese of Chiclayo in Peru, a loyal, faithful people accompanying the bishop and helping the bishop.

To all you brothers and sisters of Rome, Italy, of all the world, we want to be a synodal church, walking and always seeking peace, charity, closeness, especially to those who are suffering.
Today is the day of the Supplicatio [plea] to Our Lady of Pompeii.
Our blessed mother Mary always wants to walk with us, be close to us, she always wants to help us with her intercession and her love. So let us pray together for this mission, and for all of the Church, and for peace in the world.
We ask for this special grace from Mary, our mother.
Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
To all the faithful here present, and to all those who receive his blessing through the radio, through television, and other technologies of communication. You can recognise him in the way recognised by the church.

An Isle of Man bomb disposal specialist who was killed while volunteering in Ukraine has been described as a ""hero"" who saved ""countless lives"".
Chris Garrett died after he was involved in an incident near Izyum, in the east of the country, on Tuesday.
The 40-year-old, who had been working to clear mines and train Ukrainian troops since 2014, had co-founded a humanitarian and mine clearance charity called Prevail Together with his partner Courtney Pollock.
Board member Shaun Pinner said Mr Garrett's ""legacy will carry on"" through the charity's work and he would be ""like a talisman"" for the organisation.
He praised Mr Garrett, who was known as ""Swampy"" to his friends and leaves behind a young daughter, for his record clearing some 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes of land mines throughout his time in the war-torn country. 
He was a ""very disciplined and motivated person"" who ""loved talking to people and making new friends"", Mr Pinner said. 
The death was ""like losing a family member"", he added.

The bodies of a journalist and his partner have been found in South Africa in an advanced stage of decomposition, more than two months after they went missing, local media groups have said.
Police said they had found human remains, but DNA tests still needed to be conducted to confirm they were those of radio journalist Sibusiso Aserie Ndlovu and his partner Zodwa Precious Mdhluli.

Armed Israeli security forces have forced the closure of three schools run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.
Hundreds of Palestinian students were sent home from the schools in Shuafat refugee camp just after classes began on Thursday morning.
Unrwa's Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, said Israeli authorities were denying children their basic right to learn and accused them of a ""blatant disregard of international law"".
An Israeli ban on Unrwa took effect earlier this year and Israel accuses the agency of being infiltrated by Hamas. Unrwa denies this claim and insists on its impartiality. 
Videos showed girls in uniform hugging each other outside one school in Shuafat following the arrival of Israeli forces outside.
A closure order fixed to the wall of the school read: ""It will be prohibited to operate educational institutions, or employ teachers, teaching staff or any other staff, and it will be forbidden to accommodate students or allow the entry of students into this institution.""
Unrwa said that more than 550 pupils aged six to 15 were present and that one of its staff members was detained, in what its director in the occupied West Bank called ""a traumatising experience for young children who are at immediate risk of losing their access to education"".
Israeli security forces surrounded three schools in Shuafat just after classes began
The agency said that Israeli police were also deployed at three other schools in East Jerusalem, forcing them to send their students home too.
""Storming schools and forcing them shut is a blatant disregard of international law,"" Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X. ""These schools are inviolable premises of the United Nations.""
He added: ""By enforcing closure orders issued last month, the Israeli authorities are denying Palestinian children their basic right to learn.
""Unrwa schools must continue to be open to safeguard an entire generation of children.""
The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank not under Israeli control, said the move was a ""violation of children's right to education"".
The British consulate in Jerusalem said the UK, EU, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Japan strongly opposed the closure orders issued against the Unrwa schools and stood ""in solidarity with students, parents, and teachers"".
""Unrwa has operated in East Jerusalem under its UN General Assembly mandate since 1950. Israel is obliged under international humanitarian law to facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the education of children,"" they added.
Last year, Israel's parliament passed laws forbidding contact between Israeli officials and Unrwa, as well as banning activity by the agency in Israeli territory.
Israel captured East Jerusalem, along with the rest of the West Bank, in the 1967 Middle East war.
It effectively annexed East Jerusalem in 1980 in a move not recognised by most of the international community, and sees the whole city as its capital.
Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their hoped-for future state.
Approximately 230,000 Israeli settlers currently live in East Jerusalem alongside 390,000 Palestinians.
Most of the international community considers the settlements built there and elsewhere in the West Bank to be illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last year - although Israel disputes this."

Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, of New Albany, Mississippi, is accused of repeatedly sending the Friends star unwanted voicemail, email and social media messages since March 2023.
The 48-year-old is alleged to have crashed his grey Chrysler PT Cruiser through the front gate of Aniston's home in the Bel Air neighbourhood of Los Angeles on Monday afternoon.
Prosecutors said the collision caused major damage and Aniston, 56, was at home at the time of the incident. 
According to the LA Police Department, a security guard stopped Carwyle on Aniston's driveway before police arrived and arrested him.
Carwyle has been charged with felony stalking and vandalism, prosecutors said on Thursday.
He also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm.
Carwyle is accused of harassing the Friends actor since 1 March 2023 by sending her unwanted communications. 
He is due to appear in court on Thursday. 
If convicted of the charges, he could face up to three years in prison, according to the LA Police Department. 
District Attorney Nathan Hochman said: ""Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions. 
""My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorise others.""

Access to the social media account of Istanbul's jailed opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, has been blocked by the authorities in Turkey.
Imamoglu, who is the main rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, can no longer send messages in Turkey to his 9.7 million followers on X. His account is still accessible abroad.
His social media feed has been his main tool for communicating with his supporters and keeping himself in the public eye.
He had been posting daily by sending messages out from prison via his lawyers.  ""It's like the authorities want to make him disappear,"" one commentator said.
Imamoglu's Republican People's Party (CHP) - the main opposition party in Turkey - told the BBC that blocking his account was a continuation of ""the coup attempt on 19 March"", when he was arrested.
''Now they won't even allow him to speak to the public,"" said CHP Secretary General Selin Sayek Boke. ""It clearly shows the fear of those in power that they will be losing power. It's a coup attempt against the next ballot box.""
Opinion polls suggest that Ekrem Imamoglu, who has been elected mayor of Turkey's largest city three times, would win a presidential election if he was able to stand.
The next presidential election is not due to be held until 2028.
A message on his account on Thursday said it had been blocked due to a legal demand, although it is still available in Turkey with the use of a virtual private network (VPN).
A short message on Imamoglu's account showed it had been blocked ""in response to a legal demand""
A lawyer representing X said he had filed a court challenge to the ban, at the request of the social media platform.
Istanbul prosecutors are investigating a post on Imamoglu's account, on the basis that it may constitute an incitement to commit crime, according to the president's communications office.
In that post last month, the mayor condemned his arrest and a wider crackdown on the opposition and called on the nation to complain and ""raise your voice"".
Some X users have replaced their profile pictures with images of the mayor, including Yusuf Can, analyst at the Middle East Programme of the Wilson Centre in Washington.
""Elon Musk has blocked the account of the hostage mayor and presidential candidate, upon Erdogan's request â silencing the country's most prominent opposition voice. We are all Imamoglu,"" he said.
The mayor has been behind bars since March on corruption charges, which he has denied.
He is being held in Marmara high security prison in Silivri, on the outskirts of the city he was elected to run. 
He has plenty of company - around 100 people were arrested with him - including city officials and members of his party. Dozens more have been arrested since, including his lawyers, and lawyers acting for those lawyers.
Human rights groups say the arrests are part of an accelerating attack on civil society in Turkey.
Imamoglu's supporters say the charges against him are politically motivated, and that Turkey's courts have been weaponised. The government has said the judiciary are independent.
In his most recent post, on Wednesday, Imamoglu called on supporters to join a protest rally in Istanbul that night.
It was one of the biggest in recent weeks with tens of thousands turning up.
His arrest in March sparked the largest anti-government protests in Turkey in over a decade.
The protests were largely peaceful but around 2,000 people were arrested in just a few days, many of them students.
The demonstrations are continuing in Istanbul, and around the country, but numbers have been smaller."

Two university security officers were injured when protesters forced their way into Butler Library on Wednesday, according to a statement from the university president, who called activists' actions ""outrageous"".
Video posted on social media showed chanting protesters entering the library, many wearing keffiyeh headscarves and masks, defying a ban from the Trump administration that was imposed after widespread campus demonstrations last year.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the visa statuses of those involved would be reviewed.
More than 70 protesters were reportedly arrested. No one has yet been charged, and authorities have not given details about who is being held and whether they are in the US on visas.
In a post on social media, the protesters accused the university of ""violent repression"" and said that they had refused to show their IDs to police and campus public safety officers.
Rubio described the group as ""trespassers and vandals"". He added that ""pro-Hamas thugs are no longer welcome in our great nation"", echoing Trump's justification for his recent crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protests. 
As well as targeting prominent individuals - by revoking hundreds of international student visas and threatening deportations - Trump's team has also taken direct aim at top-tier US universities, such as Columbia, which he accuses of failing to fight antisemitism on campus.
Columbia suspends and expels protesters who occupied building
Who is Mahmoud Khalil, former Columbia student facing US deportation?
Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?
Videos of the latest action at the prestigious New York institution showed protesters vandalising bookshelves by writing ""free Palestine"". 
Another clip showed public safety officers blocking the library door's exit and asking those inside to show their Columbia IDs or face arrest, which led to an hours- long standoff.
Claire Shipman, the Columbia president, said she had asked the New York Police Department (NYPD) for assistance on Wednesday, adding that many of the protesters involved in the latest action were not students.
""At the direct request of Columbia University, the NYPD is responding to an ongoing situation on campus where individuals have occupied a library and are trespassing,"" police confirmed in a post on X.
Ms Shipman said that while the protest was isolated to one room in the library, ""it is completely unacceptable that some individuals are choosing to disrupt academic activities as our students are studying and preparing for final exams"".
The Columbia president, who took over the role in March after her predecessor resigned, asked students to stay away from the library. 
""We will not tolerate hate or violence in any form in our city,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a post on X.
It marks the first time that Columbia University has called the NYPD for an on-campus protest since April 2024, when protesters occupied Hamilton Hall for nearly 24 hours.
Crowds of protesters grew as a standoff with security and a group calling themselves ""Columbia University Apartheid Divest"" at the library continued into the evening
Columbia has drawn particular ire from Trump, who claims many universities have tolerated antisemitism and harassment of Jewish students.
The president has already threatened to withhold some $400m (Â£309m) in federal funding for Columbia, as his administration continues to threaten those involved in previous campus protests with deportation.
In March, Columbia agreed to several demands from the Trump administration, including a ban on face masks at protests and a change in oversight of some academic programmes, after the administration said it planned to withhold millions in federal funds.
It is unclear whether the funds will be reinstated, though a lawsuit was filed by some of the faculty members over the cuts.
Columbia was the epicentre of last year's protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel. But it is not the only institution that the US government has targeted.
The administration has warned 60 universities that funding may be cancelled if allegations of antisemitism on campuses are not addressed.
On Tuesday, Trump also terminated $2.2 billion in taxpayer funds to Harvard University after ordering a review of its federal financing. The university has refused to bend to Trump's demands.
Pro-Palestinian protest activity appears to be increasing at US colleges again, as graduation ceremonies begin and heightened attention is drawn towards campuses.
On Monday, over two dozen protesters were arrested by police in armoured gear at the University of Washington for occupying an engineering building."

A US judge in Boston ordered a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to deport migrants to Libya, saying it would ""clearly violate"" a prior order he made that ensures their right to due process.
The order came after two US officials told BBC partner CBS News that the US may soon start deporting migrants to Libya as part of its crackdown on immigration.
In response to the deportations report, Libyan Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh wrote in a statement on X that his country refused ""to be a destination for the deportation of migrants under any pretext."" 
Responding to the same report, a spokesperson for the US state department said they would not discuss the matter.
The officials who spoke to CBS - who requested anonymity - said the US military could fly migrants to the North African country as early as this week.
The move is likely to spark controversy - Libya has been mired in conflict for more than a decade and the US state department advises Americans not to travel there due to factors like crime, terrorism and civil unrest.
Immigration lawyers moved quickly on Wednesday to prevent the Trump administration from carrying out the deportations, asking a Massachusetts judge to ""urgently"" issue a temporary block. 
""Multiple credible sources report that flights are preparing to immediately depart the United States carrying class members for removal to Libya,"" the attorneys wrote in their court filing
US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston responded late on Wednesday afternoon by issuing an order that restricts the Trump administration's ability to quickly deport the migrants.
In his ruling, Judge Murphy said the deportations ""blatantly"" defy an injunction he had previously issued that protects the due process rights of migrants subject to final deportation orders.
That earlier ruling requires officials to provide migrants with a written notice in their language and a meaningful opportunity to file a claim to protect them from removal.
Asked whether he was aware of the plan to deport migrants to Libya, President Donald Trump said on Wednesday: ""I don't know. You'll have to ask homeland security.""
Libya is thought to be one of several countries asked to accept migrant deportations by Trump's administration. 
This week Rwanda confirmed it was in the ""early stage"" of talks with the US, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini and Moldova have all been named in media reports.
Migrants on edge as Trump administration ramps up raids and arrests
Trump's first 100 days - in numbers
It is not clear how many people the US hopes to deport to Libya, or which part of Libya the migrants would be sent to. 
Since the overthrow of former ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has been divided into two - the west is ruled by a UN-backed government, of which Dbeibeh is prime minister, while military strongman Gen Khalifa Haftar controls the east.
Haftar's son met US officials in Washington last Monday, but the US state department and a Libyan spokesperson said the meeting was not about deportations.
Since returning to office in January, President Trump has launched a mass deportation campaign - at times relying on controversial tactics such as the invocation of a centuries-old wartime law.
Earlier this week, the government offered migrants who are in the US illegally a sum worth $1,000 (Â£751) to leave the country.

A woman has been killed in an axe attack at the University of Warsaw in Poland, police said.
The university said she was a staff member and had come under attack in the main campus building on Wednesday evening. A university guard who came to her aid was seriously injured.
A 22-year-old Polish man has been arrested. His motives remain unclear although a local prosecutor said he was a third-year law student who was Polish but not from Warsaw.
The university described the attack as a ""huge tragedy"". It declared a day of mourning on Thursday with no classes taking place.
The attacker entered the college campus shortly after 18:40 local time (16:40 GMT).
From there he moved on to the university's biggest lecture hall, the Auditorium Maximum building.
Polish reports said the woman killed in the attack was a 53-year-old porter who died at the scene. The security guard who came to her help is 39.
The university said that everyone had been shocked by the murder. 
""We express our great sorrow and sympathy to the family and loved ones,"" the rector, Alojzy Nowak, said in a statement.
Justice Minister Adam Bodnar was taking part in a panel discussion in a nearby lecture theatre. He said he had not seen the attack but was told by his state protection officers what had happened.
He praised one of his officers who he said ran to the scene to help the university guard who tackled the attacker.
Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski also expressed his shock at what he described as a ""macabre crime"" on the campus. ""This brutal attack must be severely punished,"" he added.
The university had been due to host its annual music festival, Juwenalia, on Friday and Saturday but that has also been cancelled."

The auction house Sotheby's has postponed its sale in Hong Kong of hundreds of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains, after a threat of legal action by the Indian government. 
The sale of the collection - described as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era - had drawn criticism from Buddhist academics and monastic leaders. India had said it offended the global Buddhist community.
Sotheby's said the suspension would allow for discussions between the parties.
A British official named William Claxton PeppÃ© unearthed the relics in northern India nearly 130 years ago, alongside bone fragments identified as belonging to the Buddha himself. 
The auction of the collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems of the Historical Buddha Mauryan Empire, Ashokan Era, circa 240-200 BCE, was due to take place on 7 May.  
In a letter to the auction house two days earlier, the Indian government said that the relics constituted ""inalienable religious and cultural heritage of India and the global Buddhist community. Their sale violates Indian and international laws, as well as United Nations conventions"".
A high-level Indian government delegation then held discussions with Sotheby's representatives on Tuesday.
In an emailed statement, Sotheby's said that in light of the matters raised by India's government ""and with the agreement of the consignors, the auction ... has been postponed"". 
It said updates on the discussions would be shared ""as appropriate"".
Notice of the gems sale had been removed from its auction house by Wednesday and the website page promoting the auction is no longer available.
William Claxton PeppÃ© was an English estate manager who excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, the believed birthplace of Buddha. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago.
The findings included nearly 1,800 gems, including rubies, topaz, sapphires and patterned gold sheets, stored inside a brick chamber. This site is now in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
Sotheby's had said in February that the 1898 discovery ranked ""among the most extraordinary archaeological discoveries of all time""."

Cassius Turvey's death sparked protests and vigils across Australia
Two men have been found guilty of the murder of Cassius Turvey, an Aboriginal schoolboy who was chased down by a vigilante gang and beaten, in a case which outraged Australia.
The 15-year-old Noongar Yamatji boy died of head injuries in October 2022, 10 days after he was brutally assaulted on the outskirts of Perth - prompting vigils and protests nationwide.
Four people were charged with his murder and Jack Steven James Brearley, 24, and Brodie Lee Palmer, 29, were on Thursday found guilty after a 12-week trial.
Mitchell Colin Forth, 27, was instead found guilty of manslaughter, and a woman who was with the trio in the moments before the attack was acquitted.
Speaking outside court, Cassius' mum Mechelle Turvey said she was ""numb with relief"" at the verdict after ""three months of hell"".
But she added that ""justice, to me, will never be served because I don't have my son, and he's not coming back"".
The trial was told the attack on Cassius was the culmination of a complex series of tit-for-tat events ""that had absolutely nothing to do with him"", according to the Australian Associated Press.
The group had been ""hunting for kids"" because somebody had damaged Brearley's car windows, prosecutors said.
""Somebody smashed my car, they're about to die,"" Brearley was heard saying on CCTV footage captured shortly before the incident and played to the court.
There is no suggestion Cassius had any involvement in what happened to the car, but he was among a throng of kids who were confronted by the trio of men while walking along a suburban street after school.
A boy on crutches was assaulted, sending the others scattering through nearby bushland to escape.
Prosecutors alleged the trio caught Cassius and knocked him to the ground, where he was hit on the head at least twice with a short metal pole, leaving him with a brain bleed.
In the days after the attack, Cassius underwent surgeries in hospital, aimed at relieving the pressure on his brain and saving his life. Meanwhile, Brearley was caught on camera boasting about beating the child.
""He was laying in the field and I was just smacking him with a trolley pole so hard, he learnt his lesson,"" he was heard saying on a phone call played at the trial, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Brearley told the court his assault on Cassius was self-defence, and claimed it was Palmer who had hit him with the metal pole. Palmer said the opposite, blaming Brearley.
Ultimately the jury found both responsible for his murder, and Forth guilty of manslaughter.
The men are due to return to court for sentencing hearing on 26 June.
Outside court, Mrs Turvey embarked on a list of thank yous, including for the trial witnesses, most of whom were ""young children that are scarred for life"".
""I'd like to thank all of Australia, people that know us, for all of their love and support,"" she added.

Speaking to the BBC the month after his death, Mrs Turvey said her son was beloved in the local community.
Along with two of his friends, he had set up a small business in order to reach out to neighbours and mow lawns. He wanted to change the negative stereotypes about Aboriginal youth in Australia.
""He was funny. He loved posing,"" Mechelle Turvey said, showing photos of Cassius smiling.
His killing in 2022 sparked national grief and anger. Thousands of people attended vigils for Cassius in more than two dozen places across the country, with events also being held in the US and New Zealand.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese claimed the attack was ""clearly"" racially motivated - though this was not advanced as a motive in court - and it reopened a national debate about racial discrimination.
""Australia does have a shocking reputation around the world for this kind of violence,"" Human rights lawyer Hannah McGlade told the BBC at the time."

Eighty years ago during World War Two, a Spanish artist found himself with an unlikely job, being paid by the British government to draw satirical cartoons of the enemy, from a quiet Nottinghamshire village.
Lindah Kiddey said villagers in Laneham were initially suspicious of their resident artist Mario Armengol, with some believing ""he must be a spy"".
In fact, he was working to support the government's propaganda effort, creating cartoons which poked fun at Hitler and his army. 
Mr Armengol's story is to be the subject of a new documentary which is currently being developed by Spanish journalists. 

One of Mario Armengol's cartoons, predicting a dark outcome for Hitler
But how did an artist from Catalonia come to be in Nottinghamshire during World War Two? 
Ms Kiddey, from Radcliffe-on-Trent, whose mother Rolindez De Madariaga had a  long relationship with Mr Armengol, despite them both marrying other partners, is one of the people who is helping to tell his life story. 
She said the artist was born in 1909 in San Juan de las Abadesas, near the Pyrenees and was put on a list of ""undesirables"" due to his political beliefs during the Spanish Civil War in 1938.
Although he was married, he left the country and crossed into France, where he was arrested and joined the Foreign Legion.
Lindah Kiddey says Mr Armengol was her mother's ""soul mate""
Mr Armengol was eventually posted to Britain in July 1940, where he was given permission to stay and met Ms Kiddey's mother at her family's Spanish restaurant in Liverpool, where they formed a connection.
Ms Kiddey said he was suffering from ""shell shock"" now known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to experiences in the Spanish civil war and the ongoing World War Two. 
Mr Armengol moved from London to the quiet village of Laneham, where he began work creating cartoons for the British Ministry of Information, ultimately drawing about 2,000 cartoons and artworks to support propaganda efforts. 
Mario Armengol's cartoon suggesting Hitler is marching to disaster
Ms Kiddey said: ""The good citizens of Laneham, a tiny village, were basically farmers and they'd never seen a foreign person before, let alone a man with a strong accent, wearing a beret, who was sending these large parcels on a weekly basis through their tiny post office to His Majesty's government, so they thought he must be a spy.""
But, she said he befriended people, entertained the local children and became ""a sort of folk hero"".
""He was very charismatic, people were drawn to him because he was such a dynamo,"" she said.
Hitler depicted as a 'Popeye' style character
She said the cartoons were distributed across North and South America, to encourage the Americans to join the war, and across Europe, even going in to underground publications in occupied countries.
Later in life Mr Armengol and Lindah Kiddey's mother, Rolindez De Madariaga, lived together in Nottinghamshire and are buried in the same plot at Radcliffe-on-Trent cemetery.

Ms Kiddey said she hoped a new documentary being produced by two Spanish journalists, as well as art exhibitions that have taken place in Spain, will all help to introduce his work to a wider audience. 
""The war cartoons stand alongside any of the major cartoonists of the time, in terms of caricature and content. 
""His fine art is magnificent and his industrial and commercial design is also wonderful,"" she said.
The new documentary about the life of Mario Armengol is due to be out in 2026.

Little jumpers knitted by grandmothers are being used to prevent penguins caught in oil spills from getting ill while trying to clean their feathers.
Dubbing themselves the Knitting Nannas, the group based at Hazelgrove Court Care Home in Saltburn, Teesside, have been sending their mini creations to a charity in Australia.
The woolly tops are used as a barrier to stop the birds ingesting toxic chemicals when they try to preen themselves after swimming through oil.
Joyce Baxtrem, 94, explained that she has knitted jumpers for both her children but she had ""never knit for a penguin"" before.
Phillip Island, south of Melbourne, is home to 40,000 penguins and preparation is ongoing to help look after them in the event of an oil spill.
Rehabilitation jumpers can be temporarily placed on an affected penguin until its feathers can be cleaned by rescue workers.
Knitting groups around the world are sending jumpers to help the penguins
Hazelgrove activities co-ordinator Sharon Lewis said she loves finding worthwhile projects for the knitting group.
""We have now posted them to Australia and we've been in touch with the charity to make sure they arrived safely.
""The residents love getting involved and using their lifelong skills to support others. 
""It gives them a sense of purpose and pride and it's always incredible to receive pictures of cute animals wearing their knitted items.""
Joyce Wooffindin, 83, could not believe she was creating clothes for penguins but said: ""This is the sort of thing we do at Hazelgrove.""
Thanking the Knitting Nannas, Rebecca Passlow from The Penguin Foundation said ""generous knitters and groups from all around the world"" have been making jumpers to help. 
In the past, the nannas have also knitted blankets for baby rhinos, which were sent to a wild rhino sanctuary in South Africa.

The leader of Australia's third-largest political party, the Greens, has conceded his seat in Melbourne after a tight electoral vote count that lasted several days.
Adam Bandt, who had safely held the seat of Melbourne since 2010, told reporters on Thursday afternoon that he had called Labor candidate Sarah Witty to congratulate her on her victory.
Australia's centre-left Labor party won Saturday's federal election by a landslide, decimating the conservative Liberal-National Coalition while also gutting the left-leaning Greens.
While the Greens got the highest vote in Melbourne, Bandt said the main reason for their loss was the preference votes for Liberal and the far-right One Nation party.
Australia uses a preferential voting system, where candidates are ranked in order of preference.
If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are redistributed, and that process is repeated until someone secures a majority.
""To win in Melbourne we needed to overcome Liberal, Labor and One Nation combined, and it's an Everest we've climbed a few times now, but this time we fell just short,"" Bandt said. 
""We came very close,"" he added, ""but we couldn't quite get there.""
Bandt also cited the so-called Trump effect as a ""key defining feature of the election"" - the Coalition's PM candidate Peter Dutton was often compared to the US President, which he rejected but it stuck.   
Bandt said that contributed to a five-week ""riptide"" that saw votes swing away from Liberal and Dutton, and towards Labor.
This same effect also pulled votes away from the Greens, he added: ""The riptide from Liberal to Labor had an effect on us as well."" 
""People in Melbourne hate Peter Dutton, and with very good reason. They've seen his brand of toxic racism for many years... and like me, many wanted him as far away from power as possible.
""My initial take is some votes leaked away from us, as people saw Labor as the best option to stop Dutton.""
Like Bandt, Dutton also lost his seat in the election, adding to his resounding defeat at the polls by incumbent Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
Bandt has held the seat of Melbourne since 2010
Bandt, who has been leader of the Greens since 2020, said he wanted to thank the Melbourne community for ""regularly giving me the highest vote, including this election, and to thank you for the last 15 years and the chance to do some amazing things together"".
He listed off a string of achievements by the Greens under his leadership, including the party's pivotal role in the marriage equality plebiscite, the First Nations Voice to Parliament referendum, and advancing ""world-leading climate legislation"".
""Fighting the climate crisis is the reason I got into politics, and I want to thank everyone in Melbourne for helping us make a difference,"" Bandt said.
He also thanked his party colleagues, noting that he leaves the party with ""the vote for the Greens higher than when i started, and our biggest ever representation in parliament"".
Bandt thanked the African and Muslim communities in Melbourne, as well as ""everyone that had the courage to speak up against the invasion of Gaza, and spoke up for peace in Palestine"".
Finally, he thanked his wife, Claudia.
""Not only could I have not done this without her, we've done it together,"" he said.
In his closing remarks, Bandt offered some ""free advice to the media"".
""We're in a climate crisis,"" he said. ""I really want the media to stop reporting on climate as a political issue, and start thinking of it as if our country were being invaded. We should treat the climate crisis as if there was a war on.""
""Please, please start taking the climate crisis seriously, and holding this government and any future government to account."""

Mr Foster joined the Royal Navy when he was just 17.
""In 1940 I was a telegram boy. Then at 16 I heard you join the boy service in the Royal Navy so I went and volunteered. My parents were furious,"" he said.
When it was VE day, he remembers being aboard his ship and there being rum to celebrate - but not for him. He was 19 and you had to be 20 to get the alcohol.
""I was given a glass of lime juice,"" he recalled.
The Royal Family of Norway returned on a British ship after the liberation - the HMS Norfolk
As HMS Viceroy and other vessels headed towards Norway, minesweepers were in front of them as they approached the port at Trondheim. 
Mr Foster remembered being unsure of what to expect as they approached the shore.
""We thought the Germans might want to carry on with the war.""
He saw a senior German officer sitting a deckchair, smoking, and plenty of Russian prisoners of war who were happy to see the allied forces.
Mr Foster told the BBC the living conditions on ships ""were worse than the Germans"". He was on a destroyer originally built in 1917 which was cold and wet.
""It was very uncomfortable. The modern sailors wouldn't accept it,"" he added.
Norway has recognised those in the British military who were part of the liberation
Among his medals and historical papers from the time, which includes the Norway medal of honour, Mr Foster also has a letter from Winston Churchill.
It thanked the crew of HMS Viceroy for sending over some brandy, which the sailors found after destroying a German U-boat.
""A cannister floated up which should have contained an inflatable life raft but instead of that there were one or two cases of German schnapps.""
The decision was made to send some to the Prime Minister.
Winston Churchill sent a thank you note to the HMS Viceroy for some brandy
Mr Foster said he is ""very proud"" of the part he played in the war, but it did not come without tragedy for his family, as his brother Gordon died.
""His reward is a military grave in Italy. I'll never forget the sadness it created for my mother.
""I thought I don't want this to happen to me now. I don't want my mother to go through this again.
""He wasn't a fighting man, he was called up to the army. He was a gentleman.""
Mr Foster said he feels lucky to have his memories still and said it ""feels like yesterday"".
""I feel as though if some of my shipmates were to walk along the road now, I'd consider it natural, as if they ought to be there.""

596,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly8y1kglkpo,2025-05-08 00:07:08,"Is Ivory Coast's red card politics an own goal for democracy?,","Even a stellar international business career cannot prepare you for the hard realities of politics in Ivory Coast, where some are questioning the democratic credentials of the West African nation most famous for being the producer of much of the world's cocoa and some of its finest footballers.
That is the painful lesson Tidjane Thiam is learning as he waits to see whether deal-making in the corridors of power and popular pressure from the street can rescue his bid to become president of Ivory Coast.
Seemingly relentless progress towards the election set for this October came to a juddering halt on 22 April when a judge ruled that the 62-year-old had lost his Ivorian citizenship by taking French nationality decades previously and not revoking it until too late to qualify for this year's vote.
Moving back to Ivory Coast in 2022 after more than two decades in global finance, Thiam had immediately been seen as a potential contender to succeed current head of state Alassane Ouattara who, at 83, is now in the final year of his third term of office.
A scion of a traditional noble family and a great nephew of the country's revered founding President, FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny, he had impressed as a top government official and minister in the 1990s, overseeing infrastructure development and radical economic reforms.
A military coup then pushed Thiam to seek a fresh career abroad, which culminated in high-profile stints as chief executive of UK insurance giant Prudential and then the banking group Credit Suisse.
But returning home at last, three years ago, he embarked on a steady advance towards the next Ivorian presidential election.
After the death in 2023 of former President Henri Konan BÃ©diÃ©, long-serving leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), Thiam was perfectly positioned to take his place and then on 17 April this year he was chosen as the party's candidate for the upcoming presidential race.
That was no guarantee of victory, and especially if - as seems quite plausible Ouattara opts to run for a fourth term, backed by all the assets and advantages of incumbency and a track record of four successive years of annual economic growth above 6%.
However, Thiam stood out as the prime alternative.
President Ouattara congratulates French-Ivorian SÃ©bastien Haller after he scored the goal that clinched the Africa Cup of Nations title for Ivory Coast last year
As an opponent of the ruling Rally of HouphouÃ«tists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), he offered Ivorian voters the chance to change their government.
Yet with his centrist politics and solid technocratic credentials, his candidacy offered reassuring competence and the prospect of continuing the impressive economic progress that Ouattara has piloted since 2011.
Now that potential trajectory is blocked. If the court decision stands - and Ivorian law offers no option of appeal for this particular issue - Thiam will be out of October's contest.
It is a race from which past court convictions have already excluded three other prominent opposition figures - former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro and a former minister, Charles BlÃ© GoudÃ© - all central actors in the political crises and civil conflicts that brutally paralysed the progress of Ivory Coast between 1999 and 2011.
The prospect now is that Ouattara or any chosen RHDP successor candidate will approach the election without facing any heavyweight political challenge.
That can only deepen Ivorians' already widespread popular disillusionment with the country's political establishment.
This is against the wider context of a West Africa where the radical anti-politics rhetoric of the soldiers who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger already finds a sympathetic audience among many disenchanted young people.
That really matters in societies where, typically, three-quarters of the population is under 35.
The economy of Ivory Coast, regarded as the regional powerhouse, is growing and  has recovered well under Ouattara from the devastation of recent civil wars
Amidst this crisis for West African democracy, there have been some moments of encouragement.
In Liberia in 2023 and in Senegal and Ghana last year, incumbent governments were voted out, in free and fair elections whose results were accepted by all contestants without argument.
The Senegalese result, in particular, owed much to the massive enthusiastic mobilisation of young people.
Many hoped that Ivory Coast could offer a further positive example of democratic choice and the offer of change, and an example that might be all the more influential because the country is a prosperous regional powerhouse.
It is the economic engine of the CFA franc single currency bloc and besides the cocoa industry, it is also a key hub for business services and finance and a leading political voice in the regional grouping, the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).
What happens in Ivory Coast really matters and is widely noticed, across West Africa and indeed, also right across francophone Africa more generally.
Ouattara is one of the continent's most prominent statesmen, commanding broad respect internationally too.
And yet now the run-up to the country's crucial next presidential election has become ensnared in a return version of the identity politics that so soured the bitter disputes and instability of the 1990s and 2000s.
Back then, the governments of first BÃ©diÃ© and then Gbagbo used the contentious ""ivoiritÃ©"", meaning ""Ivorian-ness"" law to shut Ouattara out of standing for the presidency on the grounds that his family allegedly had foreign origins. 
It was only in 2007 that the government scrapped the ban on his candidacy and only in 2016 - when he was already in office - that a new constitution at last ended the requirement that the stated parents of presidential candidates be native-born Ivorians.
President Ouattara (R) has reconciled with Laurent Gbagbo since the 2011 post-poll unrest, but his predecessor is barred from seeking office again
The poisonous mobilisation of identity issues had been a major contributing factor to the civil wars, street violence and northern separatist partition that brutally scarred Ivory Coast for more than a decade, up to 2011, at a cost of thousands of lives.
Today the country feels far from such large-scale conflict.
There is no popular appetite for a return to confrontation and politicians are staying well away from the incendiary rhetoric of the past.
But the Thiam saga shows how identity issues, even in a more legalistic form and in this hopefully more peaceful era, can still weigh heavily.
Ivory Coast only permits dual nationality under certain limited conditions.
So in its 22 April ruling, an Abidjan court declared that, under the terms of a little-used post-independence law, Thiam had automatically lost his Ivorian citizenship almost four decades ago when he acquired French nationality - after several years' study in Paris.
Although he officially surrendered that this February, and thus automatically recovered his original citizenship, this was too late for inclusion on this year's register of eligible voters or candidates.
Tidjane Thiam told the BBC: ""The bottom line is, I was born an Ivorian""
In vain, his lawyers had argued that, through his father, Thiam had French nationality from birth - which, if accepted, would exempt him from the dual nationality ban.
Seeking to highlight the absurdity and inconsistencies of the situation, he argued that, logically, the country should now hand back its prized 2024 Africa Cup of Nations football title because many of the players also have French nationality.
""If we apply the law the way [that] they just applied it to me, we have to give the cup back to Nigeria - because half of the team was not Ivorian,"" he told the BBC.
And Thursday could bring yet another setback in a scheduled court hearing where a judge may now rule that Thiam cannot, as a non-national, lead the PDCI.
The past two weeks have seen continuing political and legal debate over this whole saga, with the Thiam camp hoping that a combination of popular pressure and discreet political negotiation will lead to a compromise that lets him back into the presidential race, perhaps along with the other excluded contenders.
And Ouattara, should he chose not to run, might want to safeguard his impressive track record and secure his international reputation by intervening with some kind of deal that allows Thiam to run.
With months to go before the polls, there is still time for that. But no-one is counting on it.

Her latest remarks come after she and Prime Minister Mark Carney met with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday to talk about a new partnership.

The meeting between Trump and Carney, however, appeared to go well, as the two agreed on a ""fresh start"" for the US-Canada relationship, Joly said.
The foreign minister told the BBC on Wednesday that it was important for Canada to assert its sovereignty while putting itself in a position to negotiate a ""new trade and security partnership"" with its southern neighbour.

While Trump praised Carney during and after Tuesday's meeting, his messages were mixed on the question of whether he would remove tariffs on Canada. 
He was initially non-committal, saying ""we'll be talking about different things"", but later told reporters there was nothing Carney could say to sway him in Canada's favour.
Trump has imposed general tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico, and sector-specific import taxes on cars, some of which have been suspended pending negotiations.
The US president, who accuses Canada of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl south, levied similar duties on steel and aluminium.
Joly said the tariffs caused widespread anxiety in Canada, and became the number one ballot question in the recent Canadian election. 
""Some have lost their jobs, and many families are affected,"" she said. ""My job and the prime minister's job is to make sure that we defend them."" 
Carney told reporters that he ""pressed the case"" to the US president on lifting tariffs, and found him to be ""willing to have that negotiation"".
On Wednesday, the prime minister was back in Ottawa where he held a virtual meeting with the leaders of Canada's provinces to update them on his trip.
Ontario premier Doug Ford told reporters that they congratulated Carney. 
""I don't think I'd have the restraint that he had, to be very frank, but in saying that, I think it's a good start on a new relationship,"" Ford said.
Carney is now busy assembling his cabinet, which is expected to be unveiled next week ahead of Canada's parliament opening later this month.
The prime minister invited King Charles III to formally open parliament on 27 May - the first time Canada's monarch has done so since 1977. 
The King's visit is yet another ""clear signal"" of Canada's sovereignty, Joly said. 
Canada also plans to host the G7 summit in June, which Trump is expected to attend."

""These,"" says Dr Anas al-Hourani, ""are from a mixed mass grave."" 
The head of the newly-opened Syrian Identification Centre is standing next to two tables, covered in femurs. There are 32 of the human thigh bones on each laminated white tablecloth. They have been neatly aligned and numbered. 
Sorting is the first task for this new link in the long chain from crime to justice in Syria. A ""mixed mass grave"" means that corpses were thrown one on top of another.
The chances are, these bones belong to some of the hundreds of thousands believed to have been killed by the regimes of the ousted president Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, who together ruled Syria for more than five decades. 
If so, says Dr al-Hourani, they were among the more recent victims: they died no more than a year ago.
Dr al-Hourani is a forensic odontologist: teeth can tell you so much more about a body, he says, at least when it comes to identifying who the person was. 
But with a femur the lab workers in the basement of this squat grey office building in Damascus can begin the task: they can learn the height, the sex, the age, what sort of job they had; they might also be able to see whether the victim was tortured.
The gold standard in identification is of course DNA analysis. But, he says, there is just one DNA testing centre in Syria. Many were destroyed during the country's civil war. And ""because of sanctions, a lot of the precursor chemicals that we need for the tests are currently not available"".
They've also been informed that ""parts of the instruments could be used for aviation and so for military purposes"". In other words, they could be deemed ""dual use"", and so proscribed by many Western countries from export to Syria.
Add to that, the cost: $250 (Â£187) for a single test. And, says Dr al-Hourani, ""in a mixed mass grave, you have to do about 20 tests to gather all the parts of one body"". The lab relies entirely on funding from the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The new government of Islamist rebels-turned-rulers says that what they call ""transitional justice"" is one of their priorities. 
Many Syrians who have lost relatives, and lost all trace of them, have told the BBC that they remain unimpressed and frustrated: they want to see more effort from the people who finally chased Bashar al-Assad from power last December after 13 years of war.
During those long years of conflict, hundreds of thousands were killed, and millions displaced. And, by one estimate, more than 130,000 people were forcibly disappeared. 
At the current rate, it can take months to identify just one victim from a mixed mass grave. ""This,"" says Dr al-Hourani, ""will be the work of many, many years.""
Eleven of those ""mixed mass graves"" are slung around a beautiful, barren hilltop outside Damascus. The BBC are the first international media to see this site. The graves are quite visible now. In the years since they were dug, their surface has sunk into the dry, stony earth.
Accompanying us is Hussein Alawi al-Manfi, or Abu Ali, as he also calls himself. He was a driver in the Syrian military. ""My cargo,"" says Abu Ali, ""was human bodies.""
Abu Ali thinks he transported lorry-loads of civilian corpses under the Assad regime
This compact man with a salt and pepper beard was tracked down thanks to the tireless investigative work of Mouaz Mustafa, the Syrian-American executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US-based advocacy group. He had persuaded Abu Ali to join us, to bear witness to what Mouaz calls ""the worst crimes of the 21st Century"".
Abu Ali transported lorry loads of corpses to multiple sites for more than 10 years. At this location, he came, on average, twice a week for roughly two years at the start of the demonstrations and then the war, between 2011 and 2013. 
The routine was always the same. He'd head to a military or security installation. ""I had a 16m (52ft) trailer. It wasn't always filled to the brim. But I'd have, I guess, an average of 150 to 200 bodies in each load.""
Of his cargo, he says he is convinced they were civilians. Their bodies were ""mangled and tortured"". The only identification he could see were numbers written on the cadaver or stuck to the chest or forehead. The numbers identified where they had died. 
There were a lot, he said, from ""215"" - a notorious military intelligence detention centre in Damascus known as ""Branch 215"". It is a place we will re-visit in this story.
Abu Ali's trailer did not have a hydraulic lift to tip and dump his load. When he backed up to a trench, soldiers would pull the bodies into the hole one after another. Then a front-loader tractor would ""flatten them out, compress them in, fill in the grave.""
Three men with weathered faces from a neighbouring village have arrived. They corroborate the story of the regular visits by military lorries to this remote spot. 
And as for the man behind the wheel: how could he do this for week after week, year after year? What was he telling himself each time he climbed into his cab? 
Abu Ali says he learned to be a mute servant of the state. ""You can't say anything good or bad."" 
As the soldiers dumped the corpses into the freshly excavated pits, ""I would just walk away and look at the stars. Or look down towards Damascus.""
Damascus is where Malak Aoude has recently returned, after years as a refugee in Turkey. Syria may have been freed of the chokehold of the Assads' dynastic dictatorship. Malak is still serving a life sentence.
For the past 13 years, she has been locked into a daily routine of pain and longing. It was 2012, a year after some of the people of Syria had dared to raise a protest against their president, that her two boys were disappeared.
Malak Aoude's two sons were disappeared under Assad's rule
Mohammed was still a teenager when he was conscripted into Assad's army, as the demonstrations spread and the regime's deadly crackdown sparked a full-blown war. 
He hated what he was seeing, his mother says. Mohammed started absconding, and even went on the demos himself. But he was tracked down. 
""They broke his arms and beat his back,"" says his mother. ""He spent three days unconscious in hospital.""
Mohammed went AWOL again. ""I reported him missing,"" says Malak. ""But I was hiding him."" 
In May 2012, 19-year-old's Mohammed luck ran out. He was caught along with a group of friends. They were shot. Malak says there was no formal notification. But she has always assumed he was killed.
Six months later, Mohammed's younger brother Maher was dragged from school by officers. It was Maher's second arrest. He'd gone to the protests in 2011, aged 14. That had led to his first arrest. When he was let out of detention, a month later, he was in his underwear, covered, says his mother, in cigarette burns, wounds and lice. ""He was terrified.""
Malak thinks Maher was disappeared from school in 2012 because the authorities had found that she had been hiding his older brother. Now, for the first time in 13 years, Malak returns to that school, desperate to get any clue about what happened to Maher.
The new headteacher produces a couple of battered red ledgers. Malak traces the rows of names with her finger, and then finds her son's name. December 2012, the record flatly states: Maher has been excluded from school because he has failed to turn up for lessons for two weeks. 
There is no explanation that it is the state which has disappeared him. There is something else, though: a folder with Maher's school records has been found. Its cover is adorned with a photograph of a wise Bashar al-Assad, gazing thoughtfully into the distance. Malak picks up a pen from the headteacher's desk and scribbles over the photo. Six months ago, that gesture could have been lethal.
For years, the only scraps Malak had to cling to were two men who say they saw Maher in ""Branch 215"" - that same military detention centre which produced so many corpses for Abu Ali to transport. 
One of the witnesses told Malak that her boy had told him something about his parents that, his mother says, only he could have known. It was definitely him. ""He asked this man to tell me he was doing fine."" Malak heaves and leaks tears, stuffs a tattered tissue into the corners of her eyes.
For Malak, like so many Syrians, the fall of Assad was not just a day of joy, but of hope. ""I thought there was a 90% chance Maher would walk out of prison. I was waiting for him.""
But she has not even been able to find her son's name on the prison lists. And so the throb of pain continues to course through her. ""I feel lost and confused,"" she says. 
Her own younger brother, Mahmoud, had been killed by a tank firing on civilians in 2013. 
""At least he had a funeral."""

""Not even in my wildest imagination did I think this would happen,"" said Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David, describing the day he found out that he had been appointed a cardinal.
He was speaking to the BBC at his cathedral in Caloocan, on the outskirts of the Philippine capital Manila. He was leaving the next day for Rome to join the conclave, one of three cardinals from the country who will take part in choosing the next pope.
""Normally you would expect archbishops to become cardinals, but I am only a humble bishop of a little diocese where the majority of the people are slum dwellers, urban poor, you know.
""But I thought just maybe, for Pope Francis, it mattered that we had more cardinals who are really grounded there.""
Cardinal David has only been in the job for five months, after his surprise elevation last December. But in some ways he personifies the late pontiff's legacy in his country.
Pope Francis had set himself the goal of bringing a Catholic church he believed had lost its common touch, back closer to the people. 
""Apu Ambo"", as Cardinal David is affectionately called by his congregation, fits that mission well, having spent his life campaigning for the poor and marginalised.
The Philippines has the largest Roman Catholic population in Asia, nearly 80% of its 100 million people, and the third-largest in the world.
It's one reason why Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is believed to be a papabile, or frontrunner to replace Pope Francis â Tagle was also talked of as a contender in the last papal conclave 12 years ago.
The country is considered a bright spot for the Roman Catholic church, where faith is strong, its rituals woven into the fabric of society.
Yet the church is facing headwinds there. Its doctrines on divorce and family planning are being challenged by politicians, and newer charismatic churches are winning converts.
Pope Francis helped restore morale in the Philippines church, though he did not offer answers to these challenges beyond being more welcoming of diversity and urging the clergy to be more responsive to the needs of the poor.
But those on the activist wing of the church did feel encouraged by his support. 
For Cardinal David that support was critical when he faced his greatest test, during the war on drugs declared by former President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016.
He took me to see a plaque he had erected in front of his cathedral in memory of Kian Delos Santos, a 17 year-old boy from his diocese who was gunned down by police in August 2017.
Kian was just one of many thousands who died in Duterte's campaign â estimates range from 6,300 to 30,000. What made his case different from most was that the usual police justification, that he was armed and had resisted arrest, was contradicted by eyewitnesses and security camera videos. 
The police officers had murdered him as he pleaded for his life. Three officers were eventually convicted of the murder, a rare instance of accountability in the drug war.
The cardinal is still visibly affected by the hundreds of killings that happened in his diocese â a cluster of low-income neighbourhoods typical of the areas targeted by the police in their notorious tokhang, or ""knock and plead"" raids, against alleged drug dealers and users.
Cardinal David had a plaque put up in memory of Kian
""It was just too much seeing dead bodies left and right,"" Cardinal David says. 
""And you know, when I would ask people what they thought, you know, why these people were targeted. They said they're drug users. I said, so what? So what? Who told you that just because people use drugs, they deserve to die?""
He began offering sanctuary to those who feared they were on police hit lists, and then drug-rehabilitation programmes, in the hope this might protect them.
He also did something the church as a whole did not do for several months: he openly criticised the drug war as illegal and immoral.
As a result, he received many death threats. President Duterte accused him of taking drugs, and talked about decapitating him. The government also filed sedition charges against him, though these were eventually dropped.
In those difficult years Cardinal David found he had a powerful backer, in Rome.
On a visit to the city in 2019 Pope Francis had taken him aside to give him a special blessing, saying he knew what was happening in his diocese and urging him to stay safe. 
When they met again in 2023, and he reminded the Pope that he was still alive, he says the pontiff laughed and told him: ""You have not been called to martyrdom yet!""
A photo of Kian held up at a protest in Manila in 2018, the year after he was killed 
The role of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines has changed over its 500-year history in the archipelago. 
It was closely associated with the Spanish conquest, Spanish friars acting as de facto colonial administrators and the church becoming a big landowner. When the US replaced Spain as the colonial ruler in 1898, enforcing a separation of church and state, the political influence of the Catholic clergy waned. 
But the church retained the allegiance of most of the population; even today, after inroads made by charismatic protestant churches, nearly 80% of Filipinos identify as Roman Catholic.
Since independence in 1946 the church has had an uneasy relationship with power. Its deep roots and establishment status have made it an influential player, wooed by political factions but also needing their support to protect its interests.
Attitudes began changing in the 1970s and 80s, the time when a young Pablo David and many other senior church figures today were studying to enter the priesthood.
This was the era of ""liberation theology"", which came out of Latin America and argued that it was the duty of the clergy to fight against the pervasive poverty and injustice all around them. 
When then-President Marcos, father of the current president of the Philippines, declared martial law in 1972 and began jailing and killing his critics, some priests even went underground to join the armed resistance. 
But the church hierarchy continued what it called ""critical collaboration"" with the Marcos dictatorship.
That changed dramatically in February 1986, when the then-Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jaime Sin, called on people to come out on the streets and oppose Marcos, sparking the famous ""people power"" uprising which deposed the president.

Cardinal Sin would reprise that role in 2001 when he helped overthrow another beleaguered president, Joseph Estrada.
After that, though, church leaders were accused of cosying up to Estrada's successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, partly to gain her support in opposing growing political and social pressure to expand access to family planning and legalise divorce.
And they were reluctant to condemn President Duterte's drug war because, despite the appalling human cost, it remained popular with the Filipino public, at least away from the poorer areas where the killings took place.
Nearly 40 years after its pivotal role in overthrowing the Marcos regime, the church's influence once again seems to be waning, as it did a century ago.
For instance, the Church's fervent opposition could not prevent the Philippines Congress from passing the Reproductive Health Law of 2012 that made family planning easily accessible.
This is despite the fact that many Filipino Catholics remain conservative on issues like gender and divorce, says Jayeel Cornelio, a sociologist who has written extensively on Catholicism in the Philippines.
The church's defeat over family planning, he says, is indicative of its diminished sway over national politics.
""The Catholic church was practically sidelined during the Duterte presidency. When Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos ran for president in 2022, many Catholic leaders and institutions expressed their dissent and even endorsed the opposition. But Marcos still won.""
As visible as the Catholic faith is in the Philippines, the power of the Church has declined
Many Filipinos welcome this, including, it seems, Cardinal David.
""It is not the business of the church to govern, neither is it the business of government to run a church"", he said. 
""But we can complement one another - I cannot say we will be apolitical. So long as we stick to our role as a moral and spiritual leader, we can give guidance, even about political and economic matters.""
Even that more limited view of the church's proper role, though, has run into opposition. 
Thirteen years after overcoming ecclesiastical objections to the Reproductive Health Bill, the Philippines Congress is now trying to get a bill passed which would legalise divorce, something else the church disagrees with.
""I do not expect them to change their official doctrine, but in my job as a lawmaker, I try to address the problems that Filipinos face, and I don't want them to meddle in my work. It is against our constitution to legislate in favour of any religion,"" says Geraldine Roman, the first transgender member of Congress in the Philippines.
A practicing Catholic, she credits Pope Francis with creating a more welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ people with his ""who am I to judge"" statement. 
""Nobody misgenders me in my church now,"" she says.
But she objects to the Catholic church lobbying against the divorce bill, which she argues will free thousands of Filipino women trapped in abusive marriages.
""The church is free to try to indoctrinate Catholics into sticking it out in their marriages. But in the end, it is the decision of the couple, and not even the church can meddle in that decision.""
Geraldine Roman is the first Filipina transgender member of Congress
Other challenges include a congregation which is increasingly disengaged. While the number of Roman Catholics has fallen only slightly in the past three decades, the number attending mass at least once a week has dropped by half, to just over one third of those surveyed recently.
Then there are the various scandals associated with the Catholic church, especially the sexual abuse of minors, which critics say Pope Francis, while he did tackle the issue, did not do enough to address.
Cardinal David recalled how President Duterte ""loved to wave"" a book called ""Altar of Secrets"", an expose of alleged scandals in the Filipino church, and how he would say, ""oh, those hypocrites. Don't listen to them. They don't practice what they what they preach. They are abusers. I must say some people swallowed it hook, line and sinker. So I am not surprised that our moral credibility has been challenged.""
But, he adds, defensiveness is not the way the Church can win back its credibility.
""It should be humility. As Pope Francis advised, dare to be vulnerable. Dare to be criticised. Try not to remain on that pedestal where people cannot reach you, show your humanity.""

For the past three years, when peers of Australia's former Liberal Party leader Peter Dutton were grilled over his divisive persona, they'd often profess his celebrity status in the north.
""Peter is one of usâ¦ He's very popular in Queensland,"" said the leader of the Nationals, the Liberal's coalition partner, earlier this year.
But on election night, it was Dutton's home state that delivered Labor its election win, with the red landslide ousting the veteran MP from his own seat of Dickson.
While votes are still being counted, Labor could pick up as many electorates in Queensland as it did across every other state and territory combined.
And that's thanks, in no small part, to a new bloc of young voters and women who are disillusioned with the Coalition, and attribute the party's emphatic loss to the ""Dutton effect"".
As 65-year-old coalition voter Sue, who didn't share her last name, bluntly puts it: ""This is where [Dutton's] fromâ¦ People know him and they don't like him.""
The Moreton Bay region, about an hour north of Brisbane, is supposed to be Dutton heartland. Before Australia's federal election on 3 May, all three seats here were Liberal-held - though only by small leads, with Dutton's electorate of Dickson having the narrowest in the state.
Dutton's family have deep roots here, with his dairy farming great-grandparents having settled in the area in the 1860s. 
When he first entered parliament 24 years ago, the region was made up of urban pockets and industrial estates surrounded by swathes of semi-rural land. Not quite metropolitan or rural, is how the former police officer described it in his maiden speech as MP.
Now Brisbane is one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, and these outer northern suburbs are one of the main places it is squeezing people in. Residential development has exploded, and more  families, priced out of locations closer to the city, have moved in to Moreton Bay.
Full of the ""quiet Australians"" Dutton said would deliver him the election, outer-suburban neighbourhoods like these were at the heart of the Coalition's strategy. 
The average household in Moreton Bay earns less than both the state and national average, with many of them relying on the health, trade and hospitality sectors for work. The Coalition hoped promises to cut fuel expenses, improve housing affordability and back small businesses would woo voters concerned about the cost of living. 
Kenneth King says Dutton is a great local member
Many Moreton Bay residents, like campaign volunteer Kenneth King, also felt Dutton's links to the area would give them a boost.
""I've known Peter Dutton for a lot of years,"" the Dickson local told the BBC on polling day. ""He's always been someone of high character, serious about effective policies and a lot of empathy for ordinary Australians.""
""He's very well respected in the communityâ¦ People know him.""
But there's a difference between being well known and well liked, says Aleysha, a swing voter in the neighbouring electorate of Petrie, who declined to give her surname.
""I don't know whether he appeals to the everyday person,"" the 26-year-old nurse says. ""He doesn't put himself in the people's shoes.""
Her vote over the years has gone to a range of parties from right across the political spectrum â except the Greens, she adds with a quick laugh.
""I don't sit with any party. Being a Christian, it's whatever party aligns closest to my values,"" she says, adding that the future of her two young children is the other major consideration.
Luke Howarth held the seat of Petrie for 12 years
This election, that meant her vote went to Coalition incumbent Luke Howarth, who she knows personally from her church.
But while she's praying for a miracle, with the final votes still being counted, she's not surprised to find Howarth may be on his way out.
She says Labor ran very visible campaigns in the area, but tells the BBC that it was driving past the image of Howarth and his leader on billboards which stuck in her mind. 
""Unfortunately I think that's what did it,"" she says.
""Peter Dutton's face behind him was a huge turnoff - for me personally too.""
Sue, who lives in the same electorate and is generally a conservative voter, says this election she was torn at the ballot box.
""I had a huge hesitation over it,"" she says. ""I don't like Albanese; I think he's like, weak. 
""[But] Dutton's an unattractive personality... He thinks he's presenting himself as strong, but he presents himself as a bit of a bully.""
""Way back when, he seemed like a really good local member, but as he climbed the ladder, I don't know, something changed.""
The Redcliffe Peninsula forms part of the Petrie electorate
Ultimately Sue also voted for Howarth - and she's similarly convinced Dutton lost him the seat.
""I spoke to a few friendsâ¦ some did change their votes because of Peter Dutton,"" she says. ""People, rightly or wrongly, aligned Dutton with Trump. And that's very negative for just about any sane person.""
Many of the constituents the BBC spoke to stressed they did not want American style politics here.
Drew Cutler grew up in the seat of Longman, which shares borders with both Dickson and Petrie - and though he no longer lives in the area, the 28-year-old was so invested in the outcome he came back to campaign for Labor.
Won by Coalition MP Terry Young on a margin of 3% last election, it is now too close to call.
Mr Cutler, a former Labor party staffer, believes Labor ran very strong local campaigns. But he also thinks Dutton's policy flip-flopping and the aura of instability that projected was potent.
That included announcing, and then walking back, public service job cuts and plans to end work-from-home arrangements, as well as a fluctuating stance on electric vehicle taxes.
Such optics were especially damaging, Mr Cutler argues, when contrasted with the image of strong, decisive leadership Dutton tries to convey.
""I almost think the Australian people would have respected him more if he stuck to itâ¦ and said, 'This is what I'm putting forward - if you don't like it, don't vote for it',"" Mr Cutler tells the BBC.
Back in Dickson, Rick - a retiree and fresh Liberal Party member - said on election night that he also felt confusion played a role in the party's defeat, particularly among young people.
""I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,"" he said.
But 30-year-old April, who didn't provide her last name, says it is Dutton who didn't understand.
She can't remember a time when he wasn't in power in Dickson, and feels that over time he has lost touch with his own constituents and the country more broadly.
For her, the last straw was his instrumental role in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.
""I think he has caused a lot of harm to a lot of minority groups across the scale,"" she says.
For others in the electorate though, the last straw was watching Dutton fly to a fundraiser in Sydney as the area in and around Dickson was hit by Cyclone Alfred in February.
April (bottom right) decided to campaign for a third option
April didn't feel like Labor Party's offering was strong either, especially on climate action, so she decided to campaign for Ellie Smith, the so-called 'teal' independent running in the seat.
Disappointment - borderline embarrassment - that Dutton was from her local area had crystallised into determination: ""I felt like it was a duty in a wayâ¦ our responsibility to get him out.""
Ultimately, the Coalition lost at least six seats to Labor in Queensland â all bar one in Brisbane. And while they are a few votes ahead in Longman as the count continues, they could still lose that too.
Queensland has long been a bit of a political wildcard, and often finds itself in the ""spotlight"" at federal elections, says Frank Mols.
The University of Queensland politics lecturer points out the state helped deliver Kevin Rudd's historic election win in 2007 and Scott Morrison's ""miracle"" victory in 2019. Last election, as a record number of people across the nation voted for candidates outside the two major parties, Queensland surprised the nation by giving the Greens three seats - up from none.
There are a couple of factors that make the state more ""volatile"" and likely to deliver upsets, Dr Mols says.
Firstly, it is the only state or territory, except for the island of Tasmania, where more than half of the population live outside the capital city of Brisbane.
""We talk about Queensland always being two elections, one in the south-east corner, and then the rest - and they often get very different patterns.""
Labor also picked up the far-north Queensland seat of Leichhardt, which takes in Cairns
There's also more political fragmentation in the state, Dr Mols says, which combined with Australia's preferential voting system can make political equations here tighter, and trends harder to predict.
But he â like many of the voters the BBC spoke to â largely puts last weekend's surprise for the Coalition down to Dutton and his broadly-criticised campaign performance.
While there's a tendency to attribute success or failure to policy issues, more often its really about voters' emotional response to candidates and leaders, Dr Mols says.
""If you do the barbecue test, is Dutton a person you would walk up to? Is he somebody you would warm to or gravitate towards?
""You can wonder: was Peter Dutton, in hindsight, the Labor Party's best asset?""
Labor's Ali France is the first person to unseat an opposition leader at an election
But Dutton may have had the opposite effect for the Greens Party, which has lost at least two of the three seats it gained in Brisbane in 2022. Their party leader, Adam Bandt, also appears to have been defeated in Melbourne, an electorate he'd held for 15 years.
""Perhaps in desperation, [Dutton] was gravitating towards culture war issues, sort of echoing Trumpian themes, if you like, and that has been punished,"" Dr Mols says. ""But also the Greensâ¦ who were perhaps seen as being at the other end of that shouting match, have not done well.""
Dr Mols also believes that desperation to keep Dutton out may have seen some former Greens voters prioritise Labor this time - though he points out more centrist Teal independents appear to have bucked that trend.
In any case, he doesn't see the result in Queensland as a groundswell of love for Labor. The state was still the only jurisdiction in Australia where there were more first preference votes for the Coalition than Labor.
""There has to be enough of a swing towards a party, but it's often that preferencing that actually tilts it over the line,"" he says.
""This is more of a Liberal loss.""
For many Coalition voters, that loss is deeply felt. Rick describes it as a ""real rout"".
But among others, like Aleysha, there is an inexplicable element of mirth.
""I think it's quite funny, that he slipped as much as he did,"" she says. ""And I can't tell you why.""

Family members said they used the burgeoning technology to let Mr Pelkey use his own words to talk about the incident that took his life.

His family used voice recordings, videos and pictures of Mr Pelkey, who was 37 when he was killed, to recreate him in a video using AI, his sister Stacey Wales told the BBC. 
Ms Wales said she wrote the words that the AI version read in court based on how forgiving she knew her brother to be. 
""To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,"" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. ""In another life, we probably could have been friends.""
""I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have and I still do,"" the AI verison of Mr Pelkey - wearing a grey baseball cap - continues. 
The technology was used at his killer's sentencing - Horcasitas already had been found guilty by a jury - some four years after Horcasitas shot Mr Pelkey at a red light in Arizona.
The Arizona judge who oversaw the case, Todd Lang, seemed to appreciate the use of AI at the hearing. He sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges.
""I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,"" Judge Lang said. ""I feel that that was genuine.""
Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge and Duke Law School professor, told the BBC he was not surprised to see AI used in the Horcasitas sentencing. 
Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people. 
And Mr Grimm said because it was used without a jury present, just for a judge to decide sentencing, the technology was allowed. 
""We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,"" he said.
But some experts like Derek Leben, a business ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, are concerned about the use of AI and the precedent this case sets. 
While Mr Leben does not question this family's intention or actions, he worries not all uses of AI will be consistent with a victim's wishes.  
""If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?"" Mr Leben asked. 
For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.
""We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,"" she said."

Three former officers charged with murder in the fatal beating of a black man that  triggered nationwide protests  against police brutality have been acquitted by a state jury in Memphis, Tennessee.
Tyre Nichols, who was beaten during a traffic stop in 2023, died three days after sustaining numerous blows to the head, according to a post-mortem report. 
Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, Jr were found not guilty on all charges on Wednesday, including second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.
All three have been convicted of separate federal charges, and still face long prison sentences. 
Two other officers involved in the death, Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills, have pleaded guilty to federal charges, avoiding trial.
Federal charges are ones that violate federal laws enacted by Congress. They are brought by the Department of Justice and usually carry stiff sentences.
The five officers, who are all black, were members of the Memphis police department's Scorpion Task Force, a since-disbanded street unit that was tasked with bringing down crime levels in the city.
Who was Tyre Nichols?
Five key questions raised by Tyre Nichols video
Video footage of the incident shows Mr Nichols being pulled over by police for alleged reckless driving.
A scuffle develops and officers use pepper spray and a Taser on Mr Nichols as he breaks free.
The five policemen caught up with him about a block away and began to assault him as he cried out for his mother.
He died three days later, with a post-mortem examination ruling it a homicide from blunt-force trauma.
On Wednesday,  the state jury took over eight hours to reach their verdict, following an emotional nine-day trial.
The proceedings took place in Hamilton County, over 300 miles (480km) away from Memphis after the judge ruled that the trial should take place outside of Memphis.
Defence lawyers had argued that it would be difficult to find an impartial jury in the city.
Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy told reporters that he and the Nichols family were ""disappointed"" and ""devastated"" by the verdict.
""I think we can understand why they'd be outraged by this result given the evidence,"" he said on Wednesday. ""We respect the jury's decision but we obviously very strongly disagree with it."" 
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Nichols' family, issued a statement calling the verdicts ""a devastating miscarriage of justice"".
""The world watched as Tyre Nichols was beaten to death by those sworn to protect and serve.""
During the trial, prosecutors said that the officers had become ""overcome by the moment"".
""Nobody is going to call them monsters,"" said prosecutor Paul Hagerman. ""It doesn't take monsters to kill a man.""
Defence lawyers blamed Mr Nichols for running from the officers, and for resisting as they attempted to place him in handcuffs. 
The verdict in the state trial comes in sharp contrast to the defendants' federal trial in 2024, when the officers were found guilty of witness tampering charges in the case. 
Haley was also found guilty of deprivation of civil rights and deliberate indifference resulting in serious bodily injury.
Bean and Smith each face up to 20 years in jail, while Haley faces a life sentence in the federal trial.
Federal sentencing hearings had been delayed until the conclusion of the state trial.
The US Justice Department in December 2024 found that the Memphis Police Department regularly used excessive force against black residents.
The findings were released after a 17-month investigation."

A diplomatic push is underway to bring India and Pakistan back from the brink as tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have escalated.
Overnight into Wednesday, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
India said it acted in response to a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir two weeks ago that killed 25 Indians and one Nepali. Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack.
Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies.
World leaders urged the two sides to exercise ""restraint"" and called for a de-escalation of tensions.
""The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan,"" UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres's spokesman said.
He said Guterres is calling for ""maximum military restraint from both countries"".
UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the situation was a ""serious concern"". 
""The UK government is urging India and Pakistan to show restraint and engage in direct dialogue to find a swift, diplomatic path forward,"" Lammy said. ""I have made clear to my counterparts in India and Pakistan that if this escalates further, nobody wins.""
Lammy also said the safety of British nationals in the region was ""our priority"", with the UK foreign office monitoring developments closely.
US President Donald Trump called it a ""shame"" and said that he ""hopes it ends very quickly"".
China's foreign ministry said India's military operation was ""regrettable"". The foreign ministry spokesperson said they were ""concerned"" about the ongoing situation and asked both countries to ""remain calm, exercise restraint and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation"".
France's Foreign Minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot told French media: ""We understand India's desire to protect itself against the scourge of terrorism, but we obviously call on both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint to avoid escalation and, of course, to protect civilians.""

India said its strikes had targeted sites ""from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed"" and ""no Pakistani military facilities have been targeted"".
Pakistan said six locations had been hit, but denied India's allegations of these being terrorist infrastructure.
Pakistani authorities said India's strikes had killed 31 people. Indian authorities said at least 15 civilians had been killed by Pakistani shelling.
Pakistan's military said it had shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.

""It worries me greatly because we do not spy on friends,"" Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen said, responding to the report in The Wall Street Journal, external.
According to the newspaper, US spy agencies were told to focus efforts on the semi-autonomous country's independence movement, and American goals to extract mineral resources there. 
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused the Journal of attempts to ""undermine"" President Trump ""by politicizing and leaking classified information"".
While not denying the report, she accused the newspaper of ""breaking the law and undermining our nation's security and democracy"".
Rasmussen, who was attending an EU ministers meeting in Warsaw, said the report was ""somewhat disturbing"". 
""We are going to call in the US acting ambassador for a discussion at the foreign ministry to see if we can confirm this information,"" Rasmussen said.
""It doesn't seem to be strongly rejected by those who speak out. That worries me.""
The Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) declined to comment on the article, but told Danish media that it had ""naturally"" taken note of US interest in Greenland. 
Based on international interest in Greenland in general, the agency said, there was an increased espionage threat against it and Denmark.
President Trump has repeatedly vowed to take control of Greenland, most recently telling NBC News on Sunday that he had not ruled out using military force to seize the arctic island. 
""I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,"" he said. ""We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of, and we'll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security.""

In Depth: Greenland's dark history - and does it want Trump?
During a speech to Congress in March, Trump told US lawmakers that ""one way or the other, we're going to get it.""
Danish officials also condemned a visit to Greenland by Vice-President JD Vance in March. 
Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said the visit to a remote US military base ""completely unacceptable pressure on Greenland, Greenlandic politicians and the Greenlandic population"".
Former President Joe Biden, speaking to BBC News in his first interview since leaving office in January, condemned Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal, to acquire Greenland and to make Canada the 51st state.
""What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,"" Biden told the BBC's Nick Robinson.  
""We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.""
Greenland, the world's largest island, has been controlled by Denmark for about 300 years. The island governs its own domestic affairs, but foreign and defence policy decisions are made in Copenhagen.
The US has long had a security interest in the island. It has had a military base there since World War Two, and Trump may also have an interest in the rare earth minerals that could be mined.
Polls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to become independent from Denmark but do not wish to become part of the US."

South African firebrand opposition politician Julius Malema says he has been denied a visa to attend a conference in the UK on 10 May. 
Malema said the UK had no ""substantial justification"" for its decision, and he saw it as an ""attempt to silence a dissenting political perspective"". 
In a leaked letter to Malema's deputy, the UK High Commissioner to South Africa, Antony Phillipson, said the Home Office had been unable to process his visa application in time for his trip. 
Malema, the leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, is a fierce critic of what he sees as ""Western imperialism"", and also advocates the nationalisation of white-owned land in South Africa.
The EFF is the fourth-largest party in South Africa, getting 9.5% of the national vote in elections last year.
A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC that they do not comment on individual cases.
In a post on X, the EFF said the High Commission had ""actively delayed the processing and approval"" of their leader's visa so that he could not speak at the University of Cambridge on 10 May. 
He had been invited by the university's African Society to address its Africa Together Conference, the EFF added.
In his letter, which the BBC has been told is genuine, Mr Phillipson said that he wanted to ""personally apologise"" that the Home Office in the UK had been ""unable to process the application in time owing to the necessary steps required to consider visa applications and the unfortunate timing of some recent UK Bank Holidays"".
He added that he had taken a ""personal interest in the issue"" over the last week.
""I recognise that this will be deeply disappointing, especially as the delegation applied in advance and some paid for priority service,"" Mr Phillipson said, in the letter to the EFF's Godrich Gardee. 
Mr Phillipson added that the Home Office had agreed to refund the application fee.
Malema said on X that the EFF delegation had been promised that ""everything would be sorted"", but received a ""regret letter just hours before our departure"".
""This is unacceptable and spineless,"" he added.

Overnight, Indian missiles had pounded buildings at this site, which lies not far from the border with India in Pakistan's Punjab region, and just a short drive from the major city of Lahore.
No one was being allowed into the complex - but even from a distance as BBC reporters peered through the barbed wire fence surrounding it, the damage was unmistakable.
The BBC spoke to people on the ground who witnessed the bombardment first-hand.
""It was the main mosque that got targeted,"" one man said. ""The sky lit up and it felt like the sky turned red.""
Another said: ""A sudden missile appeared and there was a blast. I immediately got out the house.
""I had only reached the mosque near my house when there were three more consecutive blasts. I heard all three, they were really loud.""
When a BBC team arrived in Muridke, security service personnel were closely controlling access to the site.
From a road surrounded by dense housing, the BBC's team could see a partially collapsed building and rubble spread over a huge area.
Emergency workers were still searching the wreckage for any injured or dead.
This complex houses a hospital, school and mosque, while India said it had hit sites linked to what it calls terror organisations - so why was it targeted? The answer appears to lie in its past.
Until a few years ago, it was originally used by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based militant group which is designated as a terror organisation by the United Nations.
It was later used by Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which observers have described as a front group for LeT.
Both groups have been banned by the Pakistani government, which has since taken over the facilities in Muridke.
But on Tuesday night, this complex was in the crosshairs of an Indian military which has vowed to respond to the killing of tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month.
India's government says its strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir targeted what it described as terrorist infrastructure. Pakistan's government has denied any links to the Pahalgam attack.
One man told us the Muridke complex usually houses children from miles around who come to study at the madrasa, though it was largely evacuated a week ago.
Later in the day, camera crews were allowed to access the site and see the damage up close.
The roof of one building had crumpled under the force of an explosion.
Holes had been torn through the walls of another and a large amount of debris was scattered across the ground.
Across this region, people are hoping there is not more debris before long."

In the village of Salamabad in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday morning, ruined homes were still smouldering.
This small settlement lies close to the Line of Control which separates Indian-administered and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the scene of rapidly escalating tensions in recent weeks that led to strikes from India on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Tuesday night.
The streets of Salamabad were almost completely empty the next morning. Locals said the village was struck by Pakistani shelling.
Most of the residents had fled the bombardment, leaving chickens pecking in their cages in gardens.
Bashir Ahmad, a local shopkeeper who witnessed the destruction, told the BBC that around 02:00 local time (20:30 GMT), ""while we were fast asleep, a loud explosion jolted us awake.
Mortar shells had landed near a water dam, and by 03:00 more shells struck several houses, setting them ablaze.
The government issued no warning or advisory about the cross-border shelling, and we have no safety bunkers to take shelter in.""
Bashir Ahmad was one of the few people left in Salamabad 
Salamabad is no stranger to this kind of shelling: until 2021, incidents of cross-border fire were reported regularly.
However, a ceasefire agreement signed between the militaries of both countries saw the number of attacks sharply decrease.
Life returned to normal for most, free of fear - that was, until Wednesday morning.
Uncertainty now hangs over the villages scattered along the Line of Control once more.
Mr Ahmad estimated that only a handful of Salamabad's 100 or so residents had remained, the rest having left in search of safety from what he described as the most intense shelling in years.
In the village, two homes had been torn apart by mortars.
Through a hole in the wall of one house, some crockery had remained impossibly upright on a shelf - while everything else around lay shattered or burned.
The small homes were no match for the scale of the firepower they encountered overnight.
They had been entirely hollowed out by explosions and fire, their tin roofs buckled above them.
At a hospital 40km away, Badrudin said he was injured in the shelling, along with this eight-year-old son and sister-in-law.
He identified one of the destroyed houses in a picture as his.
He said: ""We were all in deep sleep when... a mortar shell landed near our homes. The children were also asleep.
The shelling was intense, we somehow managed to flee.""
Badrudin said he had taken out a loan of â¹3 lakh ($3,540 ; Â£2,653) to build his home in Salamabad.
""Everything is gone now,"" he said. ""We're too afraid to return.""
He continued: ""Rebuilding the house will be incredibly difficultâwe need the government to step in and help.
We want peace, not war."""

Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir
BBC reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir
Pakistan's military said at least 31 people were killed and 57 injured in the strikes on Tuesday night. India's army said at least 15 civilians were killed and 43 injured by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.
Pakistan's military says it shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. India has yet to respond to these claims.
Late on Wednesday, Sharif said the air force made its defence - which was a ""reply from our side to them"".
Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.
It said these sites were ""terrorist infrastructure"" - places where attacks were ""planned and directed"". 
It emphasised that it had not hit any Pakistani military facilities, saying its ""actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature"".
In the initial aftermath of the attacks, Pakistan said three different areas were hit: Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Bahawalpur in the Pakistani province of Punjab. Pakistan's military spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif, later said six locations had been hit.
Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told GeoTV in the early hours of Wednesday that the strikes hit civilian areas, adding that India's claim of ""targeting terrorist camps"" was false.
The strikes come after weeks of rising tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the shootings in the picturesque resort town of Pahalgam.
The 22 April attack by a group of militants saw 26 people killed, with survivors saying the militants were singling out Hindu men.
It was the worst attack on civilians in the region in two decades, and the first major attack on civilians since India revoked Article 370, which gave Kashmir semi-autonomous status, in 2019.
Following the decision, the region saw protests but also witnessed militancy wane and a huge increase in the number of tourists.
The killings have sparked widespread anger in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the country would hunt the suspects ""till the ends of the Earth"" and that those who planned and carried it out ""will be punished beyond their imagination"".
However, India initially did not name any group it believed was behind the attack in Pahalgam.
But Indian police alleged that two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals, with Delhi accusing Pakistan of supporting militants - a charge Islamabad denies. It says it has nothing to do with the 22 April attacks.
On 7 May, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group carried out the attack.
In the two weeks since, both sides had taken tit-for-tat measures against each other - including expelling diplomats, suspending visas and closing border crossings. 
But many expected it would escalate to some sort of cross-border strike - as seen after the Pulwama attacks which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead in 2019.
Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947.
The countries have fought two wars over it.
But more recently, it has been attacks by militants which have brought the two countries to the brink. Indian-administered Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989, with militants targeting security forces and civilians alike.
In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control â the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.
In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.
Neither spiralled, but the wider world remains alert to the danger of what could happen if it did. Attempts have been made by various nations and diplomats around the world to prevent this. 
UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres quickly called for ""maximum restraint"" - a sentiment echoed by the European Union and numerous countries, including Bangladesh.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged ""dialogue"" and ""de-escalation"".
US President Donald Trump - who was one of the first to respond - told reporters at the White House that he hoped the fighting ""ends very quickly"". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, said he was keeping a close eye on developments."

At least 60,000 passengers have been stranded at airports across Russia because of a massive Ukrainian drone attack, local officials say.
Russia's Association of tour operators (Ator) says 350 flights have been affected since Tuesday evening in Moscow, St Petersburg, Sochi and several other cities.
The Russian defence ministry says 524 Ukrainian drones were destroyed in the past 24 hours - a record number if confirmed. No casualties were reported.
Ukraine says an overnight Russian drone and missile attack killed two people in Kyiv. 
The barrage of strikes came as a self-declared Russian three-day ceasefire was set to begin on Wednesday night, ahead of a World War Two victory parade in Moscow on 9 May.
Kyiv has repeatedly rejected the truce idea as ""theatrical play"", reiterating its call for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, which is also supported by Ukraine's allies in Europe and the US. 
Russia has issued a set of tough pre-conditions for any possible settlement - a move described by Ukraine and many European politicians as an attempt to prolong the fighting and eventually force Kyiv to capitulate.
On Wednesday, US Vice-President JD Vance said ""we think they [Russians] are asking for too much"", in an apparent hardening of his stance towards Moscow.
""It's very important for the Russians and the Ukrainians to start talking to one another,"" Vance added.
He also took a far less strident tone towards Europe than he has in recent months, saying ""I do still very much think the US and Europe are on the same team"".
Three airports serving Moscow - Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo - suffered disruption, according to Russia's tour operators association, which added that 110 flights had been cancelled in the capital.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said 19 drones had been shot down near the city since Tuesday evening. 
In St Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, 55 flights were either cancelled or delayed.
At the city's Pulkovo airport, footage emerged of a queue of planes stuck on the runway on arrival. Passengers reportedly waited for hours to leave.
Airports at several other cities including Sochi, Kazan, Kirov and Nizhnekamsk also reported flight disruption.
Russia's air traffic problems came as Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow for Friday's military parade in Red Square commemorating the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. 
A plane carrying Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to Moscow had to make a brief emergency stop in Baku in Azerbaijan, because of drone attacks across Russia, according to local reports. 
Vucic later resumed his flight, eventually landing in Moscow. Two Baltic republics, Lithuania and Latvia, had reportedly refused to allow him permission to cross their airspace.
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, thought to be the only European Union leader planning to attend, complained that Estonia's government had refused to allow him to fly over its airspace, which he said was extremely disruptive to his schedule.

The government in Tallinn said it had no intention of supporting the Moscow parade and had stressed to EU colleagues that taking part in Russian ""propaganda events should be ruled out"".
Russia says 27 world leaders are travelling to Moscow. Brazil's Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro have already arrived.
A three-day ceasefire proposed by Putin last month was due to start at midnight Moscow time on Wednesday (21:00 GMT), to coincide with World War Two victory commemorations across Russia.
Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula illegally annexed in 2014.
US Vice-President JD Vance told an audience in Washington on Wednesday that he was not yet pessimistic that the Russians did not want an end to the war. 
""We would like both the Russians and the Ukrainians to actually agree on some basic guidelines for sitting down and talking to one another,"" he said.
President Donald Trump's administration has been accused of trying to push Ukraine into making painful concessions in a bid to reach a ceasefire, while exerting far less pressure on Moscow.
Two people were killed and several injured in Kyiv in the overnight Russian drone attack, Ukrainian officials say
Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a ""significant increase in pressure on Russia"", after an attack on Kyiv killed a woman and her son. 
Emergency services were deployed across Ukraine, including in the Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Zhytomyr, Kherson and Dnipro regions.
Earlier this month, Zelensky warned that Ukraine could not guarantee the safety of anyone travelling to Moscow for the parade. 
""We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" he said. 
He indicated the Kremlin might organise provocations during the Victory Day commemorations in Russia to discredit Ukraine.
Ukraine's foreign ministry has warned against the participation of any foreign troops, calling it ""unacceptable"" and helping Moscow to ""whitewash its war crimes"".
On the eve of President Xi's arrival in Moscow, the Chinese leader hailed the ""resilient"" relationship between China and Russia.
China has sent 102 soldiers - the largest foreign military contingent among the 13 participating nations - to take part in Friday's annual 9 May  parade.
Victory Day celebrates Nazi Germany's 1945 surrender to the Soviet Union during World War Two, remembered as ""The Great Patriotic War"" in Russia.
It is Russia's most important public holiday, and Putin has repeatedly sought to draw parallels with the full-scale war he launched against democratic Ukraine.
His narrative has been rejected by Kyiv and Europe. ""These people are not liberators of Europe, they are occupiers and war criminals,"" Ukraine's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. 
Europe and Ukraine mark Victory in Europe Day on Thursday.

India said JeM's headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan, was hit.
Video footage of the mosque, assessed by BBC Verify, showed one of its domes had collapsed and extensive damage occurred inside, including two holes in the roof and one in the ground. 
In Bahawalpur on Wednesday, crowds were mourning those killed in the strikes overnight in funeral processions through the streets. 
Local residents told the BBC they were angry about the attack, but also worried about Pakistan's potential response.

Azhar founded JeM in 1999 upon his release from prison in India. JeM has been linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban, the UN Security Council has said. The UN designated Azhar as a terrorist in 2019.
India blamed an attack on Indian parliament in 2001 on JeM - a claim JeM denies. Pakistan banned the group soon after that.
JeM said it carried out a bomb attack in February 2019 that killed 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir.
Pakistani authorities said India's strikes on Tuesday night killed 31 people. Indian authorities said at least 15 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling.

At least 33 Palestinians have been killed and dozens wounded in two Israeli strikes on a crowded restaurant and market on the same street in Gaza City, medics and the Hamas-run health ministry say.
Graphic videos posted on social media showed bodies slumped at tables the Thailandy restaurant, in the northern Rimal neighbourhood, which was also operating as a community kitchen.
Footage from the nearby marketplace showed a small child with a rucksack lying dead in the street.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.
Earlier, hospitals said at least 59 people had been killed in attacks since Tuesday night, most of them at two schools serving as shelters for displaced families.
The strikes come as Israel says it is preparing to intensify and expand its military campaign against Hamas after 19 months of war.
The two strikes on al-Wahda street in Rimal - one of Gaza's busiest commercial hubs - happened almost simultaneously on Wednesday afternoon, about 100m (330ft) apart.
Footage from the scene shortly afterwards showed wounded people being transported on chairs and in the backs of cars.
A woman carrying a baby in her arms and accompanied by two other children told Reuters news agency that they were inside the Thailandy restaurant when it was struck.
""Everyone died,"" she said. ""The blood was like a lake, oh my baby, pools of blood.""
Photos shared by local activists, which could not immediately be verified, showed a number of bodies. They appeared to include a boy selling coffee, two parents and their young son, and a market vendor sitting by his small stall.
Palestinian journalist Yahya Sobeih was also killed, colleagues said, only hours after his wife gave birth to their first child.
In another video, the owner of the nearby Palmyra restaurant, Abu Saleh Abdu, said many children, elderly people and passersby were killed. 
Addressing the Israeli military, he asked: ""What do [you] want to achieve? You haven't bombed any fighters or any weapons. You've only hit civilians.""
The Thailandy restaurant was destroyed during last year's Israeli ground operation at the nearby al-Shifa hospital, but it had been rebuilt recently using tents and makeshift structures.
In addition to selling basic meals, the restaurant was also preparing hundreds of hot meals daily for humanitarian organisations to distribute to poor and displaced people.
Gaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office accused the Israeli military of committing war crimes by ""deliberately targeting gatherings of civilians and displaced people"" in four separate incidents over 24 hours.
Hamas accused the Israeli military of deliberately targeting gatherings of civilians
Women and children were among 33 people who were killed when the UN-run Abu Humeisa school in Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, was bombed twice on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.
Witness Ali al-Shaqra said on Wednesday that 300 families had been staying at the school and that the effect of the strike was like an ""earthquake"".
The Israeli military said it struck ""terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command-and-control centre"".
The military has not yet commented on a strike on the al-Karama school in the eastern Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City on Wednesday morning, which the Civil Defence said killed another 15 people.
It comes amid international condemnation of Israel's plans to expand and intensify its ground offensive against Hamas. 
Israeli officials have said they include seizing all of the territory indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite protests from the UN and its humanitarian partners.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that his security cabinet had decided on a ""forceful operation"" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages. He said Gaza's 2.1 million population ""will be moved, to protect it"", and that troops ""will not enter and come out"".
Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its 59 remaining hostages.
The renewed Israeli strikes and ground operations have already resulted in hundreds of casualties and the displacement of an estimated 423,000 people, with about 70% of Gaza placed under Israeli evacuation orders, within an Israel-designated ""no-go"" zone, or both, according to the UN.
Aid agencies have also warned that mass starvation is imminent unless the blockade ends.
The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and that there is no aid shortage because thousands of lorry loads entered Gaza during the ceasefire.
Palestinians said a school-turned-shelter elsewhere in Gaza City was hit by an Israeli strike on Wednesday morning
Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, who is based in the occupied West Bank, told the BBC that the situation in Gaza was ""a real catastrophe"".
""This cannot continue. It's a siege, famine. No water, no electricity, no hope,"" he said.
Mustafa urged the international community to step up efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas as quickly as possible, warning: ""People are dying every day in Gaza, and this should not happen anymore.""
An Israeli official said on Monday that the expanded offensive would not begin until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region next week, providing what he called ""a window of opportunity"" to Hamas to agree a deal.
However, a senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said on Tuesday that there was ""no point"" to negotiations while Israel continued what he called a ""starvation war"".
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,653 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,545 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's health ministry."

A Manx bomb disposal specialist who had been helping to train troops fighting in Ukraine has died. 
Chris Garrett was severely injured in an incident near Izyum in the east of Ukraine on Tuesday.  
Shaun Pinner, a board member of the Prevail Together charity, which was co-founded by Mr Garrett, confirmed three of its workers had been critically injured and two had since died, with Mr Garrett among them. 
The 40-year-old, from the town of Peel on the Isle of Man, had been volunteering with the Ukraine National Guard, having previously helped in the country between 2014 and 2017. He returned when war broke out in February 2022.
A statement from the charity said: ""Prevail received the devastating news that our co-founder and chairman alongside other team members were severely injured in an incident near Izyum.
""We are still gathering information and working alongside military and police officials to uncover the details.""
Mr Garrett had trained troops in how to identify mines, taking many of his own photographs
In a later statement, Mr Pinner confirmed Mr Garrett had died, adding: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families affected. We deeply appreciate all the support during this difficult time.""
From 2014, Mr Garrett had spent three years helping to clear mines and unexploded ordnance in Crimea.  
Since the Ukraine war broke out in 2022, he had been working to raise awareness about such explosives there and teaching troops how to mitigate the risks should they find them.
Speaking to the BBC in 2022, Mr Garrett said: ""I've been here before, I've had the shelling, I've had the shooting. I've had some pretty close calls in the country.""
He had said that while he himself had cleared mines in the country, he could be put to better use by training other people.
""I could go on to the contact line now and clear land mines, but I'm just one person,"" he said.
He said he was able to help many more people by ""taking groups of 10, 20, 30, 50 guys at a time and teaching them basic awareness"".
In a statement, the Foreign Office said: ""We are in contact with the local authorities following the death of a British national in Ukraine.""

Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. 
But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start?
What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir
Indian air strikes - how will Pakistan respond? Four key questions
LIVE: Tensions escalate as Pakistan vows response to Indian strikes after Pahalgam killings
Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains.
Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested.
Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan.
The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan.
Kashmir profile - Timeline
A war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held.
In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided.
Kashmir is known by some as India's Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapes
A second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces.
By that time, India and Pakistan were declared nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it.
Within Indian-administered Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, or prefer a return to the semi-autonomous status that they had until 2019. Some also want outright independence.
Religion is also an important factor: Indian-administered Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only part of India where Muslims are in the majority.
An armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region since 1989, claiming tens of thousands of lives.
India accuses Pakistan of backing militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies.
In 2019, Indian-administered Kashmir was stripped of its semi-autonomous status by the government in Delhi amid a huge security crackdown.
For several years after the revocation of the region's special status, militancy waned and tourist visits soared.
In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control - the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting alleged militant bases.
In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left more than 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted Indian airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.
Tensions rose again in April 2025 after years of relative calm when militants killed 26 people in an attack on tourists near the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack on civilians in two decades.
India responded two weeks later with missile strikes on targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, once again raising fears of further escalation and calls for restraint.
Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world.
India and Pakistan did agree a ceasefire in 2003.
In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks.
Pakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014
Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan, attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi.
But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab. Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017.
Since then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours."

Dramatic clips debunked by BBC Verify have claimed to show attacks on an Indian army base and an Indian fighter jet shot down in Pakistan.
One video, which had more than 400,000 views on X at the time of writing, claiming to show an explosion caused by a Pakistani response was actually from the 2020 Beirut Port explosion in Lebanon.
An expert told BBC Verify that in moments of heightened tension or dramatic events, misinformation is more likely to spread and fuel distrust and hostility.
""It's very common to see recycled footage during any significant event, not just conflict,"" Eliot Higgins, the founder of the Bellingcat investigations website, said.
""Algorithmic engagement rewards people who post engaging content, not truthful content, and footage of conflict and disasters is particularly engaging, no matter the truth behind it.""
One of the most viral clips, which gained over 3 million views on X in a matter of hours, claimed to show blasts caused by the Indian strikes on Pakistan-administered Kashmir. A search for screengrabs from the video on Google found the footage actually showed Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip on 13 October 2023.

What we know about India's strike on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir
Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir
While much of the debunked footage has purported to show the immediate aftermath of the Indian strikes, some clips analysed by BBC Verify appeared to be trying to portray the Pakistani response as being more severe than it actually was.
One video, which has racked up almost 600,000 views on X, claimed to show that the ""Pakistan army blew up the Indian Brigade headquarters"". The clip, which shows blasts in the darkness, is actually from an unrelated video circulating on YouTube as early as last month.
Elsewhere, one set of photos purported to show an operation carried out by the Pakistan Air Force targeting ""Indian forward air-bases in the early hours of 6 May 2025"". The images - which appeared to be captured by a drone - were actually screengrabs taken from the video game Battlefield 3.
The Pakistani military says it destroyed five jets on Wednesday morning local time. That announcement has led to some users sharing unrelated clips which they claimed showed the wreckage of Indian fighter jets. Some of these videos have obtained millions of views. 
But two widely shared images actually showed previous Indian air force jet crashes - one from an incident in Rajasthan in 2024 and another in the Punjab state in 2021. Both crashes were widely reported.
Prof Indrajit Roy of York University said that the images ""are being generated with a view to get support for the military in Pakistan"". One clip circulated by the Pakistani military itself was later withdrawn by news agencies after it turned out to be from an unrelated event. 
""We have jingoists on both sides of the border, and they have a huge platform on Twitter (X). You can see how fake news, as well as some real news, gets amplified, distorted and presented in ways designed to generate hostility, animosity and hatred for the other side.""
The conflict in Kashmir has long attracted a high degree of misinformation online. In the aftermath of the deadly militant attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam last month, AI images circulated - with some seeking to dramatise actual scenes from the attack.
Vedika Bahl, a journalist with France 24, said the Pahalgam attacks had prompted a sharp ""uptake in misinformation from both sides surrounding the conflict"".
""Lots of this misinformation begins on X,"" she said. ""Eventually this trickles down over time from X to WhatsApp which is the communication tool which is most used in South Asian communities.""

A Kenyan court has sentenced four men to one year in prison or pay a fine of $7,700 (Â£5,800) for trying to smuggle thousands of live queen ants out of the country. 
The four suspects â two Belgians, a Vietnamese and a Kenyan â were arrested last month with live ants suspected to have been destined for collectors in Europe and Asia.
They had pleaded guilty to the charges, with the Belgians telling the court that they were collecting the highly sought-after ants as a hobby and didn't think it was illegal. 
But delivering the sentence on Wednesday, the judge said the particular species of ants collected was valuable and they had thousands of them â not just a few.
""While collecting a few ants might be considered a hobby, being found with 5,000 queen ants is beyond a hobby,"" said Magistrate Njeri Thuku.
""Already the world has lost a number of species due in part to greed. It is time to stem this tide.""
She added: ""This court will do what it can to protect all creatures great and small.""
The contraband included giant African harvester ants, which are valued by some UK dealers at up to Â£170 ($220) each.
Belgian nationals Lornoy David and Seppe Lodewijckx, both 19, Vietnamese national Duh Hung Nguyen and Kenyan Dennis Ng'ang'a, were handed similar terms after the magistrate considered their mitigation arguments. 
The Belgians were found with 5,000 ants while the other two were found with more than 300 ants in their apartments.
The ants were packed in more than 2,000 test tubes filled with cotton wool to help them survive for months, authorities said. 
The Belgian teens had entered Kenya on a tourist visa and were staying in Naivasha, a town popular with tourists for its animal parks and lakes. 
Nguyen, 23, was described by the court as a ""mule or courier"" as he was just sent to pick up the ants and the person who sent him paid for his ticket.
The court said Ng'ang'a, 26, acted as a ""broker"" due to his knowledge of the ants that are found in his rural home. 
While sentencing Nguyen and Ng'ang'a, Ms Thuku said they were involved in what she described as ""illegal wildlife trade and possibly bio-piracy"".
David, an ant enthusiast with 10 colonies of ants at home in Belgium, belongs to a Facebook group called ""Ant Gang"", the court heard. 
The Belgian teen, who first visited Kenya five years ago, said he had bought 2,500 queen ants for $200 when he was arrested looking for more.
While pleading for leniency, David told the court he did not know his actions, which he regretted, were illegal. 
For his part, Lodewijckx said he had only offered to buy the ants for his entomology interest but his intention was not to traffic them. 
The ants were packed in more than 2,000 test tubes filled with cotton wool
The court ordered the three foreigners to be repatriated to their country of origin upon payment of the fine or completion of the prison term. 
The men have 14 days to appeal against the ruling.
In a statement, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) hailed the ruling as a ""testament to Kenya's zero-tolerance stance on wildlife trafficking"".
It also highlighted the ecological importance of the giant African harvester ants, noting that their removal from the ecosystem could disrupt soil health and biodiversity.
The agency said the case sent a clear message that Kenya would ""relentlessly pursue and prosecute anyone involved in the illegal wildlife trade, regardless of the species involved"".
""Traffickers often underestimate the ecological value of smaller species, but their role in our ecosystems is irreplaceable,"" it added.
The KWS, which is more used to protecting larger creatures, such as lions and elephants, had earlier described this as a ""landmark case"", warning that the demand for rare insect species was growing.
In Kenya, the ants are protected by international bio-diversity treaties and their trade is highly regulated.

Speaking in Delaware on Monday, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin believed Ukraine was part of Russia and ""anybody that thinks he's going to stop"" if some territory is conceded as part of a peace deal ""is just foolish"".
Biden, who spoke as Allied nations mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day this week, said he was concerned about US-Europe relations breaking down under President Donald Trump, which he said ""would change the modern history of the world"".
In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Biden was challenged on his own record on Ukraine as well as his decision to end his 2024 re-election bid late in the race after a stumbling debate performance stoked concerns over his fitness and plunged the Democratic Party into crisis.
White House communications director Steven Cheung posted a link to the BBC's exclusive Biden interview on social media, blasting the former president.
""Joe Biden is a complete disgrace to this country and the office he occupied. He has clearly lost all mental faculties and his handlers thought it'd be a good idea for him to do an interview and incoherently mumble his way through every answer,"" Cheung said.
""Sadly, this feels like abuse.""
Biden dropped out less than four months before the November election, and when pushed on whether he should have left sooner and allowed more time for a replacement to be chosen, he said: ""I don't think it would have mattered. We left at a time when we had a good candidate.""
""Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away. And it was a hard decision,"" he said. ""I think it was the right decision. I think thatâ¦ it was just a difficult decision.""
Asked about the current administration's treatment of US allies, the former president condemned Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal, to acquire Greenland and to make Canada the 51st state.
""What the hell's going on here? What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are,"" he said. ""We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation.""
Joe Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are'
Political Thinking with Nick Robinson: Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds, or watch on BBC iPlayer or on YouTube, external
Five key takeaways from the interview
On Ukraine, Biden was challenged on whether he gave enough support to Kyiv to ensure they could win the war as opposed to just resist Russia's full-scale invasion. During three years of fighting, his White House shifted its position on the use of US-supplied weapons and lifted some restrictions over time.
""We gave them everything they needed to provide for their independence, and we were prepared to respond, more aggressively, if Putin moved again,"" he said.
Biden was also asked about comments from the Trump administration suggesting Kyiv must give up some territory in order to secure a peace deal that would put an end to fighting.
US Vice-President JD Vance recently laid out the US vision for a peace plan in Ukraine, saying it would ""freeze the territorial lines... close to where they are today"".
He said Ukraine and Russia ""are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own"". Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has echoed that message, saying a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is ""unrealistic"".
""It is modern-day appeasement,"" Biden said on Monday, a reference to the policy of former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who sought in the late 1930s to appease Adolf Hitler's demands in a failed attempt to avoid a catastrophic all-out war in Europe.
He also expressed concern that ""Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America and the leadership of America"".
The continent's leaders, he added, were ""wondering, well, what do I do now?... Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?""
Trump has said he expects Russia to keep the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, and last month he accused Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations when Zelensky rejected the suggestion.
Reports suggest recent US proposals for a truce settlement, external not only include formal US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, but also de facto US recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas in Ukraine. The White House has not publicly confirmed the details.
""I have no favourites. I don't want to have any favourites. I want to have a deal done,"" Trump said last month when asked about recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
""Yes, of course, [the Ukrainians] are angry that they were invaded,"" VP Vance told Fox News last week. ""But are we going to continue to lose thousands and thousands of soldiers over a few miles of territory this or that way?""
The pressure to cede land is not just coming from Washington, with the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, telling the BBC last month that Ukraine may have to temporarily give up territory.
Discussing Putin, Biden said: ""I just don't understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he's going to take significant portions of land that aren't his, that that's going to satisfy him. I don't quite understand.""
He also said he feared some countries in the Nato alliance that border Russia may ""just say we've got to make an accommodation"" to Putin if Ukraine ultimately gives up land.
Trump has long resisted continuing the level of US military support that Biden gave to Ukraine, arguing that his ultimate aim is to end the bloodshed. He has previously said Zelensky played Biden ""like a fiddle"".
Tensions between the White House and the Ukrainian leader exploded into public view in February, when Trump and Vance berated Zelensky and demanded he show more gratitude for years of US support during an extraordinary televised meeting in the Oval Office.
""I found it sort of beneath America in the way that took place,"" Biden said of the meeting.
Watch in full: The remarkable exchange between Zelensky, Vance and Trump
Trump and his top officials have repeatedly criticised European countries for not spending enough on their own defence and relying too heavily on US support.
The US is by some margin the largest single donor to Ukraine, but European countries combined have spent more money, according to the Kiel Institute, a German-based think tank tracking support for Kyiv.
""I don't understand how they fail to understand that there's strength in alliances,"" Biden said of the Trump administration on Monday. ""There's benefits... It saves us money overall.""
When asked about President Trump's first 100 days in office, which has seen a whirlwind of executive actions as well as sweeping cuts to the size and spending of the federal government, Biden touted his own record and sought to draw a stark contrast between when he left office and now.
""Our economy was growing. We were moving in a direction where the stock market was way up. We were in a situation where we were expanding our influence around the world in a positive way, increasing trade"" he said of state of the country when he left the White House in January.
Trump, meanwhile, says he is driving a needed overhaul of the world's relationship with the US, rebalancing trade, controlling illegal immigration and making government more efficient. He celebrated the 100-day milestone with a triumphant speech last week. What does Biden make of the start to Trump 2.0?
""I'll let history judge that,"" he said. ""I don't see anything that was triumphant.""

For the second time in just eight days, a US fighter jet has been lost to the Red Sea after falling from the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, US officials say. 
An F/A-18F Super Hornet was attempting to land on the Truman's flight deck on Tuesday when a manoeuvre failed, ""causing the aircraft to go overboard"", an official told the BBC's US partner CBS News. 
The two crew members inside the aircraft ejected, and sustained minor injuries in the incident. The jets are reportedly worth around $67m (Â£50m) each.
""Both aviators safely ejected and were rescued by a helicopter assigned to Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 11,"" the official told CBS. 
It comes after another Super Hornet went overboard into the same sea last Monday in a separate incident. 
It was ""under tow in the hangar bay when the move crew lost control of the aircraft"", a US Navy statement said. A sailor sustained minor injuries, and a tractor that had been towing the aircraft was also pulled into the water.
During the second incident, officials said there was a failure of an arrestment - referring to a cable that is used to help slow down a jet as it lands.
The incident is still under investigation, and the aircraft has yet to be recovered.  
The jet may have tipped overboard after the aircraft carrier made a sharp turn while taking evasive action against Houthi militants in Yemen, US officials told CBS. 
Just hours earlier on Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced that the US would stop attacking the Iran-backed Houthis if the group stopped targeting shipping in the Red Sea.
The Truman has been involved in several incidents in its Red Sea deployment, including last December, when the USS Gettysburg mistakenly shot down another F/A-18 fighter jet that was operating from the carrier. Both crew members survived."

A senior Houthi official has rejected US President Donald Trump's claim the Yemeni armed group ""capitulated"" when agreeing a ceasefire deal, saying the US ""backed down"" instead.
""What changed is the American position, but our position remains firm,"" chief negotiator Mohammed Abdul Salam told Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV.
Mediator Oman said the US and Houthis had agreed to ""no longer target each other"", after seven weeks of intensified US strikes on Yemen in response to Houthi missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.
Abdul Salam also said the deal did not include an end to attacks on Israel, which has conducted two rounds of retaliatory strikes on Yemen this week.
The Houthis' support for the Palestinian people in Gaza ""will not change"", he added.
The Iran-backed group has controlled much of north-western Yemen since 2014, when they ousted the internationally-recognised government from the capital, Sanaa, and sparked a devastating civil war.
Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.
They have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.
The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.
On 15 March, Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis and threatened that they would be ""completely annihilated"".
At the end of April, the US military said it had struck more than 800 targets, including command-and-control facilities, air defence systems and advanced weapons manufacturing and storage facilities. It also said the strikes had killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and ""numerous Houthi leaders"", without naming them.
Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.
At the White House on Tuesday, Trump announced that the Houthis had said they ""don't want to fight anymore"".
""They just don't want to fight, and we will honour that and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,"" he said. ""But, more importantly, we will take their word.""
""They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore and that's what the purpose of what we were doing.""
Later, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi wrote on X: ""In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.""
Several aircraft were reportedly destroyed in Israeli air strikes on Sanaa's airport on Tuesday
On Wednesday, Mohammed Abdul Salam said Trump's remarks were ""a reflection of Washington's frustration after failing to protect Israeli ships and contain the fallout of its involvement"".
He also told Reuters news agency that the ""the agreement does not include Israel in any way, shape or form"".
Israel has also carried out air strikes against the Houthis since July 2024 in response to hundreds of missiles and drones that the Israeli military says have been launched at the country from Yemen.
Most of them have been shot down, but on Sunday a Houthi missile landed near Israel's main international airport, Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion, leaving six people with minor injuries.
The attack has prompted Israel to carry out two rounds of air strikes on what the military called ""Houthi terrorist infrastructure"".
The first on Monday targeted the Red Sea port of Hudaydah, reportedly destroying docks, warehouses and the customs area. The Houthi-run government's health ministry said four people were killed.
On Tuesday, Israeli jets bombed Yemen's main airport in Sanaa and several power stations.
Sources told Reuters that the runway, three aircraft, the departures hall and a military base were destroyed. Three people were killed, according to the health ministry.
""I have said many times that whoever attacks the State of Israel will pay the price,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said."

In a dramatic overnight operation, India said it launched missile and air strikes on  nine sites across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, targeting what it called militant positions based on ""credible intelligence"". 
The strikes, lasting just 25 minutes between 01:05 and 01:30 India time (19:35 and 20:00 GMT on Tuesday), sent shockwaves through the region, with residents jolted awake by thunderous explosions.
Pakistan said only six locations were hit and claimed to have shot down five Indian fighter jets and a drone - a claim India has not confirmed. 
Islamabad said 26 people were killed and 46 injured in Indian air strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between India and Pakistan. Meanwhile, India's army reported that 10 civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border. 
Follow the latest updates
What we know about the air strikes
This sharp escalation comes after last month's deadly militant attack on tourists in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, pushing tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to dangerous new heights. India says it has clear evidence linking Pakistan-based terrorists and external actors to the attack - a claim Pakistan flatly denies. Islamabad has also pointed out that India has not offered any evidence to support its claim.
In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the LoC.  
In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.
Experts say the retaliation for the Pahalgam attack stands out for its broader scope, targeting the infrastructure of three major Pakistan-based militant groups simultaneously.
India says it struck nine militant targets across Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, hitting deep into key hubs of Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. 
Among the closest targets were two camps in Sialkot, just 6-18km from the border, according to an Indian spokesperson. 
The deepest hit, says India, was a Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Bahawalpur, 100km inside Pakistan. A LeT camp in Muzaffarabad, 30km from the LoC and capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was linked to recent attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, the spokesperson said. 
Pakistan says six locations have been hit, but denies allegations of there being terror camps.

""What's striking this time is the expansion of India's targets beyond past patterns. Previously, strikes like Balakot focused on Pakistan-administered Kashmir across the Line of Control - a militarised boundary,"" Srinath Raghavan, a Delhi-based historian, told the BBC.  
""This time, India has hit into Pakistan's Punjab, across the International Border, targeting terrorist infrastructure, headquarters, and known locations in Bahawalpur and Muridke linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba. They've also struck Jaish-e-Mohammed and Hizbul Mujahideen assets. This suggests a broader, more geographically expansive response, signalling that multiple groups are now in India's crosshairs - and sending a wider message,"" he says.
The India-Pakistan International Border is the officially recognised boundary separating the two countries, stretching from Gujarat to Jammu.
Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, told the BBC that what India did was a ""Balakot plus response meant to establish deterrence, targeting known terrorist hubs, but accompanied by a strong de-escalatory message"".
""These strikes were more precise, targeted and more visible than in the past. Therefore, [they are] less deniable by Pakistan,"" Mr Bisaria says.
Indian sources say the strikes were aimed at ""re-establishing deterrence"".
""The Indian government thinks that the deterrence established in 2019 has worn thin and needs to be re-established,"" says Prof Raghavan.
""This seems to mirror Israel's doctrine that deterrence requires periodic, repeated strikes. But if we assume that hitting back alone will deter terrorism, we risk giving Pakistan every incentive to retaliate - and that can quickly spiral out of control."" 
Smoke rises after an artillery shell hits the main town in India's Jammu region on Wednesday
The majority of experts agree that a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable - and diplomacy will come into play.
""Pakistan's response is sure to come. The challenge would be to manage the next level of escalation. This is where crisis diplomacy will matter,"" says Mr Bisaria.
""Pakistan will be getting advice to exercise restraint. But the key will be the diplomacy after the Pakistani response to ensure that both countries don't rapidly climb the ladder of escalation.""
India and Pakistan are in crisis again - here's how they de-escalated in the past
Pakistan-based experts like Ejaz Hussain, a Lahore-based political and military analyst, say Indian surgical strikes targeting locations such as Muridke and Bahawalpur were ""largely anticipated given the prevailing tensions"".
Dr Hussain believes retaliatory strikes are likely.
""Given the Pakistani military's media rhetoric and stated resolve to settle the scores, retaliatory action, possibly in the form of surgical strikes across the border, appears likely in the coming days,"" he told the BBC.
But Dr Hussain worries that surgical strikes on both sides could ""escalate into a limited conventional war"".
Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US believes given the scale of India's strikes, ""visible damage at key sites"", and reported casualties, Pakistan is highly likely to retaliate.
""Doing otherwise essentially would give India permission to strike Pakistan whenever Delhi feels aggrieved and would run contrary to the Pakistan military's commitment to retaliating with 'quid pro quo plus',"" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia, told the BBC.  
""Given India's stated targets of groups and facilities associated with terrorism and militancy in India, I think it is likely - but far from certain - that Pakistan will confine itself to attacks on Indian military targets,"" he said.
Despite the rising tensions, some experts still hold out hope for de-escalation.
""There is a decent chance we escape this crisis with just one round of reciprocal standoff strikes and a period of heightened firing along the Line of Control,"" says Mr Clary.
However, the risk of further escalation remains high, making this the ""most dangerous"" India-Pakistan crisis since 2002 - and even more perilous than the 2016 and 2019 standoffs, he adds.
Indian paramilitary personnel stand guard along a road in Srinagar on Tuesday
Experts in Pakistan note that despite a lack of war hysteria leading up to India's strike, the situation could quickly shift.
""We have a deeply fractured political society, with the country's most popular leader behind bars. Imran Khan's imprisonment triggered a strong anti-military public backlash,"" says Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based analyst and a former correspondent of Jane's Defence Weekly.
""Today, the Pakistani public is far less eager to support the military compared to 2016 or 2019 - the usual wave of war hysteria is noticeably absent. But if public opinion shifts in central Punjab where anti-India feelings are more prevalent, we could see increased civilian pressure on the military to take action. And the military will regain popularity because of this conflict.""
Dr Hussain echoes a similar sentiment.
""I believe the current standoff with India presents an opportunity for the Pakistani military to regain public support, particularly from the urban middle classes who have recently criticised it for perceived political interference,"" he says.
""The military's active defence posture is already being amplified through mainstream and social media, with some outlets claiming that six or seven Indian jets were shot down.
""Although these claims warrant independent verification, they serve to bolster the military's image among segments of the public that conventionally rally around national defence narratives in times of external threat.""

India is once again walking a fine line between escalation and restraint. 
Shortly after the attack in Pahalgam, India swiftly retaliated by closing the main border crossing, suspending a water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals. Troops on both sides have exchanged small-arms fire, and India barred all Pakistani aircraft from its airspace, mirroring Pakistan's earlier move. In response, Pakistan suspended a 1972 peace treaty and took its own retaliatory measures.
This mirrors India's actions after the 2019 Pulwama attack, when it swiftly revoked Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, imposed heavy tariffs and suspended key trade and transport links. 
The crisis had escalated when India launched air strikes on Balakot, followed by retaliatory Pakistani air raids and the capture of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, further heightening tensions. However, diplomatic channels eventually led to a de-escalation, with Pakistan releasing the pilot in a goodwill gesture.
""India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience,"" Mr Bisaria told me last week."

Russia is expected to begin a self-declared three-day pause in fighting against Ukraine on Wednesday night, in a move derided by many Ukrainians and described by President Volodymyr Zelensky as little more than a ""theatrical show"".
Russia's Vladimir Putin proposed the three-day ceasefire to coincide with the anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe â a public holiday in Russia on Friday known as Victory Day.
But in doing so Putin has rejected a much more substantial proposal from the Trump administration for a 30-day ceasefire and negotiations â a proposal that was accepted by Ukraine.
Zelensky has in turn rejected Russia's unilateral three-day ceasefire and said that Ukraine will not guarantee the safety of a celebratory military parade in Moscow's Red Square on 9 May.
Rosenberg: Russians remember WW2 with victory on their minds
The Russian proposal has been met with widespread cynicism in Ukraine, where polls consistently suggest that about 95% of the population distrusts Russia.
""I don't believe there will be any ceasefire,"" said Tetyana Kondratenko, 42, a shopkeeper in Khotin Village in Sumy, a heavily bombarded region about six miles (10km) from the Russian border.
""Lately the shelling has only intensified, for half the day today we have heard boom after boom,"" Ms Kondratenko said in a phone interview.
Ukraine's Sumy border region has been heavily bombarded by Russian forces
Zelensky was right to reject the proposal ""because you know how they operate, like what happened at Easter"", she added, referring to the Russians.
""They announced a ceasefire, then used it to bring in more equipment and started attacking again. What kind of ceasefire is that?""
Last month, around Easter, Russia proposed a similar 30-hour cessation in hostilities but was later accused by Ukraine of violating its own suggested truce nearly 3,000 times.
On that occasion, rather than rejecting the proposal outright, Ukraine said it would mirror Russia's actions. 
A senior Ukrainian military officer told the BBC at the time that frontline units received an order to stop firing at Russian positions, but to record evidence of Russian violations and return fire if needed.
By Wednesday Ukrainian officials had not said categorically whether they would adjust their military action over the three-day period. Asked if Ukrainian forces planned to continue military operations, a source in the presidential office told the BBC: ""We'll see.""
From Novosofiivka village, in the very badly hit region of Zaporizhzhia, Antonina Sienina, 35, said that any ceasefire worth agreeing to should come with ""solid guarantees"" for Ukraine's safety and sovereignty â not something included in Putin's plan for the next three days.
How Russia took record losses in Ukraine in 2024

But Ms Sienina had mixed feelings. Her parents were killed in a Russian strike, her brother has been wounded, and her village has been pounded, so ""maybe it wasn't right to refuse"" the three-day proposal, she added.
""Because honestly, we would be happy even for just one day without explosions. Just to take the kids somewhere, to a shopping mall, to a playground, to some attractions,"" she said.
""We dream of the war being over, or at least a temporary ceasefire, because my children are exhausted. The nerves, the medications, the sleepless nights. It's too much.""
Ukraine's south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia has come under repeated bombardment
Residents of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv were kept awake in the early hours of Wednesday morning by Russian drone and missile strikes on the city. A ballistic missile was successfully shot down by air defence systems but a drone hit a block of flats, killing a mother and her son and injuring at least six more, including a child.
The mayor of Moscow said on Wednesday that Russian air defences had downed 14 Ukrainian drones overnight. The Kremlin said that the drone attacks had no bearing on its plans to pause fighting for three days.
The pause is not being taken seriously in Ukraine, for the most part. It has been greeted instead as more of a propaganda exercise. Pavlo Klimkin, the former foreign minister of Ukraine, told the BBC it was simply another Russian show of force.
""This is all about Russia framing the agenda on its own terms,"" Klimkin said. ""It has nothing to do with a real ceasefire. It is all about messaging â messaging internally, messaging to the US, messaging to Europe to say that we, Russia, are in control.""
Talks directed at a substantial ceasefire process began back in February, with US President Donald Trump sending officials to negotiate separately with the leaders of Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine has since agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, Russia has not.
Trump envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin several times but was unable to secure a 30-day ceasefire
The months since have been a deadly period in the war. Russia has intensively targeted Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles, killing 19 people including nine children last month in a strike on a playground in Kryvyi Rih and 35 people a week later in an Easter strike on the city of Sumy.
According to the UN, at least 848 civilians were killed between 1 and 24 April - a 46% increase on the same period last year.
The level of civilian deaths meant that any ceasefire should be accepted, even on Russian terms, said Oleksii Kamchatnyi, 38, a scientist living in Kyiv.
""It is about saving lives,"" Mr Kamchatnyi said. ""I'm originally from Donbas, from Pokrovsk. I managed to evacuate my mother but my father stayed there. I haven't had any contact with him since 9 March.""
Still, Mr Kamchatnyi supported the temporary ceasefire, he said, ""even if it means giving up territory.""
Ukrainian polling suggests that a majority of the public would accept the idea of ceding some control of territory seized by the Russians during the full-scale invasion, though not surrendering formal sovereignty over the land, according to Anton Grushetsky, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.
""There is for certainly a lot of fatigue and there is a lot of desire to have a stable peace in Ukraine,"" Mr Grushetsky said.
But based on previous polling, the majority of Ukrainians would likely view the proposed three-day ceasefire as ""either a trap or simply a ploy to avoid attacks on Moscow during the holiday"", he added.
There is also suspicion among many in Ukraine that the ceasefire proposal is simply a ploy by Russia to move its forces to strategic places on the battlefield, make reinforcements where needed, and prepare for offensives.
Ukraine had already made clear that it was ready for a full, unconditional ceasefire, and had no obligation to take part in Russia's agenda, said Mykhailo Samus, a Ukrainian military analyst and director of the New Geopolitics Research Network.
""Why would we play Putin's game? We are ready for a real ceasefire,"" Mr Samus said. ""If he wants to organise a parade to show that he is a great leader, that is his business.""

He said that he had few regrets, but he offered grave warnings about global affairs as Europe marks 80 years since the end of World War Two on the continent.
Biden spent much of his time in public office â as a senator, vice-president and president â focusing on US foreign policy, and it remains a top concern.
The former president also reflected on his decision to drop out of the 2024 election race - but he had less to say about any mistakes he and the Democrats may have made along the way.
Here are five key takeaways from his interview with Nick Robinson for BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Biden: Withdrawing from 2024 race earlier 'wouldn't have mattered'
Biden's ill-fated decision to seek a second presidential term may haunt Democrats for a generation. Three months removed from power, however, the former president said he didn't think ""it would have mattered"" if he had abandoned his re-election ambitions earlier, before a disastrous debate forced his hand in July 2024.
Kamala Harris, who became the nominee after Biden dropped out just four months before the election, was a ""good candidate"" who was ""fully funded"", he said. 
Democratic strategists have lamented that the last-minute handover left their campaign flat-footed, ultimately aiding Trump's path to the White House, even as  Democrats held a financial advantage in the 2024 race.
Biden boasted of being ""so successful on our agenda"" â a reference to the major legislation enacted in his first two years in office on the environment, infrastructure and social spending, as well as the better-than-expected Democratic performance in the 2022 midterm elections.
""It was hard to say now I'm going to stop,"" he said. ""Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away.""
Ultimately, quitting was ""the right decision"", he said, but it was ""just a difficult decision"". 

Trump appeasing Putin with pressure on Ukraine, Biden tells BBC
Biden on Trump: 'What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are'
Political Thinking with Nick Robinson: Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds, or watch on BBC iPlayer or on YouTube, external
Biden described the Trump administration's suggestion that Ukraine give up territory as part of a peace deal with Russia as ""modern-day appeasement"" - a reference to European allies that allowed Adolf Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia in the 1930s in an ill-fated attempt to prevent a continent-wide conflict.
""I just don't understand how people think that if we allow a dictator, a thug, to decide he's going to take significant portions of land that aren't his, that that's going to satisfy him. I don't quite understand,"" Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The term ""appeasement"" gets kicked around a lot in American politics, and the list of foreign leaders compared with modern-day ""Hitlers"" is a long one.
Though Biden's repeated assertion that Russian tanks would be rolling through central Europe if America and its allies didn't support Ukraine is impossible to prove, he views the threat posed by Putin as serious and worthy of the comparison.
Biden also said that if the US allowed a peace deal that favoured Russia, Putin's neighbours would be under economic, military and political pressure to accommodate Moscow's will in other ways. In his view, the promise of American support to European allies becomes less believable and less of a deterrent.
Under Biden, the US helped expand the Nato to include Finland and Sweden â one of the former president's signature foreign policy achievements. Now, he says Trump is turning his back on America's European allies and threatening the very foundations of Nato and its mutual defence agreement.
The former president described the thought of Nato breaking apart as a ""grave concern"". Already, he warned, US allies were doubting American leadership.
""I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,"" he said. ""We are not the essential nation, but we are the only nation in position to have the capacity to bring people together to lead the world.""
There are some in Trump's circle â perhaps including the president himself â who believe that a more restrained America, less concerned with global security and more focused on regional self-sufficiency, is best way to ensure long-term prosperity in a world of competing global powers. They argue that America's post-Cold War dominance was a historical anomaly.
Biden, whose political career spans those decades of American supremacy, disagrees.
In his interview, Biden sounded like most modern American presidents before him. He used words like freedom, democracy and opportunity to describe American principles.
But in Biden's view, those principles also include a sense of decorum, especially towards long-standing allies.
He said Trump's February meeting-turned-argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office was ""sort of beneath America"". He argued Trump's territorial designs on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal were ""not who we are"".
""What president ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity, not about confiscation,"" he said.
When asked about Trump's first 100 days in office - which included dramatic attempts to expand presidential power - Biden said he would let history judge his successor, but ""I don't see anything that's triumphant"".
It was the kind of understatement that surely will irk some on the left. Since the start of Trump's second term, rank-and-file Democrats have been clamouring for their party to do more to resist the president's agenda.
Biden said he didn't think Trump would succeed in flouting courts or the law, or diminishing congressional power, in part because the president's fellow Republicans are ""waking up to what Trump is about"".
""I don't think he'll succeed in that effort,"" he said.
The idea that members of Trump's own party will turn on him is a recurring one for Biden. In 2019, he predicted there would be an ""epiphany"" among Republicans once Trump was out of the White House, ushering in a new era of bipartisanship.
It didn't exactly work out that way in 2024."

Sudan has cut diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), after repeatedly accusing the Gulf nation of backing the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the country's civil war.
The announcement came as the RSF were blamed for attacks on the usually safe city of Port Sudan, which started on Sunday and have continued until Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Sudan's Defence Minister Yassin Ibrahim accused the UAE of violating his country's sovereignty through its ""proxy"", the RSF. 
The UAE has repeatedly denied allegations that it is giving financial, military and political support to the paramilitary force.
Two years of conflict has killed thousands, forced millions from their homes and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
As a result of the defence minister's announcement, the Sudanese ambassador will be withdrawn from the UAE and Sudan will shut its diplomatic missions in the Gulf nation.

Since Sunday, drone strikes have hit an international airport, a major power station and a hotel in Port Sudan. The army has accused the RSF of being behind the assault, but the paramilitary group is yet to comment.
On Wednesday the Sudanese army said it had foiled a strike on the country's biggest naval base.
""They [the drones] were met with anti-aircraft missiles,"" an unnamed source told the AFP news agency. 
Until now, Port Sudan had avoided bombardment and was regarded as one of the safest places in the war-ravaged nation.
Sudan's army has often accused the UAE of arming the RSF.
Both the UK and the US have singled out the UAE in separate appeals for outside countries to stop backing Sudan's warring parties.
However, on Monday, the UN's top court dismissed Sudan's case against the UAE, in which it accused the Gulf state of complicity in genocide.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the case could not proceed because the UAE had opted out Article 9 of the Genocide Convention, which means that it cannot be sued by other states over genocide allegations.
Reem Ketait, the UAE's deputy assistant minister for political affairs, said the court's decision was ""clear and decisive"".
""The international community must focus urgently on ending this devastating war and supporting the Sudanese people, and it must demand humanitarian aid reaches all those in need,"" she said.
Both the army and RSF have been accused of war crimes.

Why India and Pakistan fight over Kashmir
BBC reports from Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-administered Kashmir
Pakistan said eight civilians were killed and 35 others injured as a result of the strikes this morning, according to Islamabad. 
India's army has also said that at least seven civilians have been killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border between both countries.
Ruby Kaur, who lived in India's Poonch district along the LoC has been identified as one of the Indians who has been killed. 
Her uncle, Buava Singh, told the BBC that a mortar shell struck near Ms Kaur's house around 1:45 am, killing her on the spot and injuring her daughter.
""Her husband was not keeping well. She woke up to make tea for him when the mortar shell landed close to her house,"" he said.
He added that the heavy shelling on Wednesday morning was something ""we have never seen so far"". Singh says that there were no community bunkers in the area, which meant residents were forced to take shelter in their homes.
""The shrapnel hit her head. She was bleeding heavily. We rushed her to a nearby hospital, but she was declared dead,"" Mr Singh said.
Another resident from Poonch said they heard ""loud explosions for hours on Wednesday night"".

The WA state government will invest A$65m (Â£31m; $42m) to set up and support the new club over the next seven years.
WA premier Roger Cook said the announcement is ""great news for sports fans"" in the state, which has traditionally been Aussie Rules country, and will also benefit its economy.
The news comes as the NRL has been trying to broaden its appeal - both in Australia and globally - by expanding to new markets, including hosting exhibition matches in the US and inviting Papua New Guinea (PNG) to join the league full-time. 
The new team, the name and colours of which are yet to be announced, is expected to compete in the NRL Premiership competition in 2027 or 2028.
Cook said all funding from the state government will be spent in WA and the club will be chaired by a local Western Australian.
""Not only will this be great news for sports fans, it will be great news for our economy and great news for jobs,"" he said in a social media video.
Negotiations between the WA state government and the Australian Rugby League Commission had persisted for months before Wednesday's announcement.
It is estimated the new club will deliver A$28m annually in economic value once it begins competing, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
The NRL has been trying to broaden its reach and attract new audiences for years.
Last year, the Australian government, in partnership with the league, announced it will invest A$600m over ten years to set up a new team in PNG - a deal that required the Pacific nation to shun security ties with China.
The league has also partnered with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to expand the Australian sport's appeal in the US, this year for the second time opening the season with marquee matches in Las Vegas."

Key candidates in an unpredictable process,","Pope candidates (left to right) Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, cardinal Pietro Parolin, cardinal Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, and cardinalÂ Fridolin Ambongo Besungu
Who will be the next pope? 
The decision will be made by 133 cardinals who begin meeting in conclave from 16:30 (14:30GMT) in the 15th Century Sistine Chapel.
The cardinals, all under 80, will debate and then vote for their preferred candidate until a single name secures the support of two-thirds of them.
Their choice could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics, and it is harder than ever to predict who it will be.
With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, most are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.
For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. 
And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively ""progressive"" or ""traditionalist"".
Could the cardinals elect an African, an Asian or even an American pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?
Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis' potential successor.

Nationality: Italian
Age: 70
Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis â making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.
Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.
He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.
But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland ""a defeat for humanity"".
Catholic watchdog organisation Bishop Accountability has accused Cardinal Parolin of ""suppression of abuse information"" being passed to secular authorities in his role as secretary of state.
The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: ""He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.""
Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.
Nationality: Filipino
Age: 67
Could the next pope come from Asia?
Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience â meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.
The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals â which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.
He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the ""Asian Francis"" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.
He has opposed abortion rights, calling them ""a form of murder"" â a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.
But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its ""severe"" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling ""branded"", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.
The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.
Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: ""I treat it like a joke! It's funny.""
Although he did raise concerns about President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war deaths, critics suggest he could have been far more vocal on the issue. 
Some, including Philippines-based whistleblower priest, Father Shay Cullen, have criticised Tagle's handling of abuse perpetrators.
Nationality: American
Age: 69
Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?
Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.
Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.
He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made a bishop there.
Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.
He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.
Nationality: Ghanaian
Age: 76
If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.
He has claimed not to want the job. ""I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,"" he told the BBC in 2013.
Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because ""those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters"".
He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.
Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.
A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.
Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.
In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.
In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.
Nationality: Congolese
Age: 65
It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.
He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that ""unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil"".
Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.
But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: ""Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.""
Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.
Nationality: Hungarian
Age: 72
A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.
He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.
The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.
Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis' two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.
His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the ""illiberal democracy"" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.
Nationality: Maltese
Age: 68
If cardinals are looking for a candidate who will advance one of Pope Francis' key goals â to place more power in the hands of rank-and-file Catholics â they may look to Cardinal Grech.
Pope Francis made him secretary general of the Synod of Bishops in 2019. 
In that role Cardinal Grech became instrumental in helping set in motion the Pope's vision of feeding the opinions of individual believers around the world into the Church's governance.
Like the Pope he worked closely with, Grech is known to have been on a journey in regards to the way he views social issues.
He has changed his tone on homosexuality over the past decade, declaring that Francis' endorsement of same-sex civil unions was a ""storm in a teacup"".
Nationality: Italian
Age: 69
The Archbishop of Bologna grew up in Rome and soon became part of the Sant'Egidio Community, a charity that focuses on the poor and the marginalised.
He helped mediate the end of Mozambique's 15-year civil war in 1990, and took part in further mediation efforts in Guatemala and Burundi.
Made a cardinal in 2019, he was chosen by Pope Francis - ahead of his secretary of state Pietro Parolin - to act as envoy after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He travelled to Kyiv and Moscow and sought the release of 19,000 Ukrainian children taken to Russia.
He wrote the introduction to a 2018 book that called on the Church to improve its relationship with LGBT Catholics.
His closeness to Francis may ultimately count against him in the conclave.
Nationality: American
Age: 73
Born in Detroit as the eldest of 13 children, the Archbishop of Newark is well known and popular among cardinals.
Although he is considered a staunch supporter of Francis' views on offering a more open and welcoming Church, he is seen as a unifying figure. 
He has in the past deplored political polarisation in the US, warning against divisions in the Church too.
In recent years he has said the Church should welcome same-sex couples and said he does not see a ""compelling theological reason why the Pope couldn't name a woman cardinal"".
Appointed by Pope Benedict as deputy head of the Vatican office that works with religious orders and their congregations, Tobin also led a religious congregation called the Redemptorists.
He was named as archbishop in Indianapolis, before Francis made him cardinal.
Nationality: Italian
Age: 83
Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.
The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.
His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said ""death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something"".
Francis' words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.
Nationality: German
Age: 71
Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.
The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.
He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.
But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.
Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.
Nationality: Italian
Age: 60
Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.
Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as ""the heart of the life of this world"".
Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.
However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.
Nationality: Canadian
Age: 80
Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.
For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.
As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.
Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.
He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that ""Christ is male, the Church is feminine"".
Nationality: Guinean
Age: 79
Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis' reformist leanings.
The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.
He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.
While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.
Nationality: French
Age: 66
Not since Gregory XI died in 1378 has there been a French pope.
Although born under French colonial rule in Algeria, Aveline grew up in France's second city Marseille, where he later became archbishop.
He has been outspoken on avoiding ""criminalisation of immigrants as the cause of all evil"", chiming very much with Francis' focus on migrants.
Aveline also set up an Institute of Science and Theology of Religions in Marseille and promoted dialogue with Islam and Judaism. He has spoken out against one of Marseille's biggest problems, drug trafficking networks.
Considered close to Francis, two years ago he brought the Pope to Marseille for a brief visit. 
Although he speaks Arabic, one potential drawback is that he does not speak fluent Italian.
Nationality: Myanmar
Age: 76
Another Asian cardinal with strong credentials for the papacy, Bo was brought up in a large family by his mother in a country where only 1.3% of the population are Catholics.
Born in the northern Sagaing region, Cardinal Bo has seen for himself the conflict that has ravaged Myanmar.
He led Asia's bishops for two terms and was considered close to Francis, who named him as Myanmar's first cardinal and became the first pope to visit the country in 2017.
He spoke out over the plight of the Rohingya Muslims who were forced to flee the military in Rakhine state, and said Myanmar should celebrate its diversity.
Nationality: Filipino
Age: 66
Among the last cardinals appointed by Pope Francis in December 2024, David is widely known for his integrity and for speaking out against abuses during former President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs in the Philippines.
His actions led to death threats.
Widely known as Cardinal Ambo, he was ordained as a priest aged 24 and became known for focusing on the poor, insisting on the Church's involvement in social issues.
Francis made him bishop of Kalookan in 2015, and he was appointed by Asian bishops to head a commission for ""synodality"", which he said was Francis' biggest contribution, so that the Church would become ""more inclusive"" and less inward-looking.
He attended the same Jesuit-led school as Luis Antonio Tagle in the late 1970s.
Nationality: Canadian
Age: 78
Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.
Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.
He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.
Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.
During the pre-conclave period he has warned against calls for ""unity"" from traditionalist cardinals, suggesting what they really mean is a ""reversal"" of reforms  introduced by Pope Francis.
Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession."

Little wonder ministers want to lean into this deal with Delhi, grappling as they are with political heat at home from their own side and their opponents.
The latest intervention comes from a caucus of Labour MPs known as the Red Wall Group, external, primarily representing seats in the north of England and the Midlands.
In response to last week's elections, they are publicly critical of the government, including its handling of the removal of the Winter Fuel Payment from millions of pensioners.
UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks
India trade deal could undercut UK workers, opposition parties say
Four things you need to know about UK-India trade deal
Jonathan Reynolds wants to point to what he sees as the ""tangible benefits"" of making it easier for the fifth and sixth largest economies in the world to trade and made a point of claiming it would be the north of England, the Midlands and Scotland that would be the primary economic beneficiaries.
But remember this is the ""conclusion of talks moment,"" as it is described in government, not the conclusion of the deal.
Thousands of pages of text still need to be pored over and vast amounts of detail scrutinised.
And there will, in time, be a signature moment, hinted at by the prime minister in publicly accepting an invitation to visit India.
It is thought it could be another year before this is done.
The domestic political reaction to this deal has focused on one element of it: an agreement that India workers transferred to the UK and their employers won't have to pay national insurance in the UK in their first three years here.
This, the Conservative leader and former business secretary Kemi Badenoch argued, is ""lop sided"" and why she didn't sign off on the deal when she was in government.
The Liberal Democrats and Reform UK have also criticised this part of the agreement.
British officials acknowledge this is an element of the deal India really wanted, but they argue it is worth it in the round and standard practice in deals like this.
And, strikingly, the Conservative reaction isn't consistent: Sir Oliver Dowden, who sat around the same cabinet table as Kemi Badenoch as deputy prime minister, welcomed it.
There are a few key bits of context to this deal and one final observation I would make.
The context is this: the ongoing turbulence of President Trump's tariffs and the ongoing negotiations with both the United States and the European Union over improving trade deals with both.
Progress on both is expected soon â a summit with the EU will take place in the UK later this month.
And that one last thing.
Sir Keir Starmer voted against Brexit and campaigned for another referendum in the hope of stopping it.
And yet, in a twist of fate and timing, he is the first post-Brexit British prime minister to have the political space and time to grapple with the tools leaving the EU gave whoever occupies his office, with the trade-offs and arguments that brings.

The voting process to elect a new Pope, which is getting under way in Rome, will be the second conclave in a row without a cardinal from Scotland.
Experts believe Scotland is still in the ""sin bin"" with The Vatican after the country's last cardinal, Keith O'Brien, was forced to resign because of sexual misconduct allegations.
In February 2013, Cardinal O'Brien was about to take part in the ancient tradition of electing a pope - and his enthusiasm was there for all to see.
During an interview with BBC Scotland News he showed off the neat brown rectangular voting paper to be used in the secret ballot.
But it would forever remain blank.
Cardinal O'Brien, who at the time was the Catholic Church's most senior cleric in Britain, had been due to meet his peers to decide who was to replace Pope Benedict XVI - but he never made it on the plane to Rome.
The 74-year-old Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh resigned days before the conclave following The Observer newspaper's allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards priests dating back to the 1980s.
The scandal sparked global media attention and rocked the Catholic Church at a time when all eyes should have been on Rome's Sistine Chapel and the process that eventually saw Pope Francis elected.
It was a seismic blow to Scotland's standing in the Catholic Church after decades of arguably punching above its weight.
Scotland has only ever had a handful of cardinals. The Reformation, which led to restrictions on practising Catholicism lasting centuries, was largely to blame.
Even when the Catholic Church was formally re-established in Scotland in 1878, almost a century passed before such a high-ranking appointment would be made again.
The traditional red cardinal hat was handed to Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, Gordon Gray. He took part in two conclaves - August and October 1978, which saw Popes John Paul I and John Paul II elected respectively.
But Cardinal Gray's crowning moment was in 1982 when Scotland welcomed a serving Pope for the first time.
On a roasting summer's day, an estimated 300,000 people gathered in Glasgow's Bellahouston Park for a Papal Mass celebrated by John Paul II.
Pope John Paul II framed in the Popemobile arriving at Glasgow's Bellahouston Park in 1982
The next cardinal appointed in Scotland was Thomas Winning, a miner's son from Wishaw in North Lanarkshire.
Earning the nickname ""Cardinal Controversy"" for his interventions on social issues â including clashing with Prime Minister Tony Blair on abortion â he died in 2001 without taking part in a conclave.
His replacement was Keith O'Brien, who had worked his way up the church's hierarchy before being proclaimed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2003.
Cardinal O'Brien took part in the 2005 conclave which elected Pope Benedict XVI and then five years later welcomed the German-born pontiff to an open-air Mass, again at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow.
The clergyman, who was born in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, was on the path to retirement when the scandal that was to end his career broke in early 2013.
Cardinal Keith O'Brien welcomed Pope Benedict to Scotland in 2010 as Prince Philip looked on
The Observer first reported the allegations, external of four individuals who accused Cardinal O'Brien of inappropriate sexual behaviour within the Diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh.
The Herald newspaper later suggested that the cardinal had used confession by young clerics as a device for sexual grooming, external.
He contested the allegations, but in his resignation statement there was an oblique reference to the claims.
""For any good I have been able to do, I thank God. For any failures, I apologise to all whom I have offended,"" he said.
While the church had accepted his resignation from high office it allowed him to keep his cardinal moniker.
After the public spotlight faded, he initially lived in a retirement home in East Lothian.
He then moved to the north east of England where in March 2018, at the age of 80, he suffered a fall and later died.
His Requiem Mass took place in Newcastle and his remains were laid to rest with his parents at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Edinburgh.
Mario I Aguilar, Professor of Religion and Politics at St Andrews University, who wrote a biography of Pope Francis, says the Scottish cardinal scandal still looms large.
""Scotland has one peccadillo and that is Cardinal O'Brien,"" he says.
""Cardinal O'Brien was the only cardinal in the history of the church who was sacked, so we have a stain or whatever you want to call it.
""There was scandal in Rome and therefore they wondered, what to do with the Scots?
""It was clear that the Vatican had had enough and therefore they sent Archbishop Cushley to intervene.""
Leo Cushley was appointed Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh and promised a period of ""reconciliation and healing"" for Scotland's Catholics.
Cardinal O'Brien was the Catholic Church's most senior cleric in Britain
Stephen McGinty, a documentary producer and author of This Turbulent Priest, a biography of Cardinal Thomas Winning, agrees that the O'Brien scandal still casts a shadow.
""People forget that at the time he was the highest ranking figure in the Catholic Church to be sucked into this kind of behaviour. It was a world scandal.
""Scotland has a long tradition of Catholicism and up until O'Brien it was viewed well,"" he said.
Mr McGinty said there had been a clear approach by The Vatican when it came to Scotland's cardinal status.
""Cardinal Winning was told that the Vatican's viewpoint was that Scotland was separate from England and Wales so it should always get a red hat, rotating between Glasgow and Edinburgh depending on who had the most senior figure.
""I have no doubt Scotland will get a red hat in the future, we're just in the sin bin at the moment.""

For the first time in history, fewer than half of the cardinals given a vote in the conclave to decide who will lead the world's 1.4 billion Roman Catholic will be European.
This reflects the fact the growth areas of the church are in Africa and Asia.
Professor Aguilar is less optimistic about the prospect of another Scottish cardinal any time soon.
He said: ""I don't see how someone is going to let Scotland in again when there are other growing places like in Africa, for example.
""We are a very small country, there are five million Scots and 1.4 billion Catholics â you have to be realistic.""
If the case for appointing new cardinals under the next Pope is a numbers game then Scotland's case is not helped by its declining Catholic population.
The last census showed, for the first time, that a majority of people in Scotland are not religious. 
The change has been driven by a sharp decline in the number of people describing themselves as being Church of Scotland or Roman Catholic.
The number of Roman Catholics is down by more than 117,000 in the past decade and now stands at 13.3% of the population.
Attendance at Mass has also dropped steeply. The annual Catholic Directory for Scotland reported that the average weekly Mass attendance in 1997 was 235,613.
By 2023, this had fallen to 95,029 â part of a downward trend believed to have been accelerated by the Covid pandemic restrictions.
In the same year, there were an average of just 15 Catholic weddings a week across Scotland.
Archbishop Cushley, who became Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh in September 2013, has been described as ""a safe pair of hands"" by Mr McGinty. 
Having spent most of his career as a diplomat for The Vatican, it is perhaps not surprising that the 63-year-old's tenure as an archbishop has been relatively low profile and controversy-free.
However, he has not been made a cardinal.
Archbishop Cushley is probably Scotland's best chance of holding a voting card in future conclaves - but it will all hinge on his links to the next Pope and how long The Vatican takes to forget and forgive the ""stain"" of the O'Brien scandal."

The Irish government has revised down its economic growth forecasts due to global uncertainty and warned that a transatlantic trade war will lead to a further economic weakening.
It expects Ireland's domestic economy to expand by 2.5% this year, down from an earlier forecast of 2.9%.
In the event of a tariff war between the EU and US, it said growth this year would be forecast at 2%, falling to 1.75% next year.
The forecasts are for a measure known as Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) which strips out the distorting impacts of multinational companies.
The Republic of Ireland Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said there is ""evidence that firms and households are adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach""
The Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said: ""The more contested and fragmented world that is now taking shape represents a serious headwind for the Irish economy which has benefited so much from the rules-based, multilateral trade system.
""Even in the absence of any further changes in tariffs, there is evidence that firms and households are adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach. 
""In other words, they are holding off on big-ticket purchases; this is also a feature in other economies.""
Ireland's economy is among the most exposed to the potential impacts of US President Donald Trump's tariffs.
Tariffs are effectively taxes applied to goods imported from other countries.
In 2024, Irish goods exports to the US were worth â¬73bn (Â£61bn), almost a third of the country's total exports, with a particular concentration in pharmaceuticals.
Ireland's goods exports to the US surged by more than 200% in February as companies worked to get goods into the country ahead of any new tariffs.
In April, Trump imposed a minimum tariff of 10% on almost all countries, while proposing extra ""reciprocal"" duties for some trading partners, including 20% on the EU.
He later suspended the reciprocal measures, giving partners 90 days to negotiate.
On Tuesday, the EU's Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said the 90 day pause is also being used to prepare further countermeasures if talks fail.

In an exclusive and remarkably candid interview - the first since he left office - Joe Biden discusses what he really thinks of his successor's first 100 days, plus his fears for the future if the Atlantic Alliance collapses

It is hard to believe that the man I greet in the Delaware hotel where he launched his political career more than half a century ago was the ""leader of the free world"" little over 100 days ago.
Joe Biden is still surrounded by all the trappings of power â the black SUVs, the security guys with curly earpieces, the sniffer dogs sent ahead to sweep the room for explosives. And yet he has spent the last three months watching much of what he believes in being swept away by his successor.
Donald Trump has deployed the name Biden again and again - it is his political weapon of choice. One recent analysis showed that Trump said or wrote the name Biden at least 580 times in those first 100 days in office. Having claimed that rises in share prices were ""Trump's stock market"" at work, he later blamed sharp falls in share prices on ""Biden's stock market"".
Until this week, President Biden himself (former presidents keep their titles after they leave office) has largely observed the convention that former presidents do not criticise their successors at the start of their time in office. But from the moment we shake hands it is clear that he is determined to have his say too.
Biden calls Nato's promise to defend every inch of its territory ""a sacred obligation""
In a dark blue suit, the former president arrives smiling and relaxed but with the determined air of a man on a mission. It's his first interview since leaving the White House, and he seems most angry about Donald Trump's treatment of America's allies - in particular Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump appeasing Putin with pressure on Ukraine, Biden tells BBC
Five key takeaways from the interview

""I found it beneath America, the way that took place,"" he says of the explosive Oval Office row between Trump and Zelensky in February. ""And the way we talk about now that, 'it's the Gulf of America', 'maybe we're going to have to take back Panama', 'maybe we need to acquire Greenland, 'maybe Canada should be a [51st state].' What the hell's going on here?
""What President ever talks like that? That's not who we are. We're about freedom, democracy, opportunity - not about confiscation.""
Hear the full interview now on BBC Sounds
After just over 100 action-packed days of Trump there was no shortage of targets for President Biden to choose from. 
But his main concern appears to be on the international stage, rather than the domestic one: that is, the threat he believes now faces the alliance between the United States and Europe which, as he puts it, secured peace, freedom and democracy for eight decades.
Just before our interview, which took place days before the 80th anniversary of VE Day, Biden took a large gold coin out of his pocket and pressed it into my hand. It was a souvenir of last year's D-Day commemoration. Biden believes that the speech he delivered on that beach in Normandy is one of his most important. In it, he declared that the men who fought and died ""knew â beyond any doubt â that there are things worth fighting and dying for"".
I ask him whether he feels that message about sacrifice is in danger of being forgotten in America. Not by the people, he replies but, yes, by the leadership. It is, he says, a ""grave concern"" that the Atlantic Alliance is seen to be dying.
""I think it would change the modern history of the world if that occurs,"" he argues.
""We're the only nation in a position to have the capacity to bring people together, [to] lead the world. Otherwise you're going to have China and the former Soviet Union, Russia, stepping up.""
Biden argues that Trump's approach could send a dangerous message to Europe, suggesting it's time to give in to Russia
Now more than ever before that Alliance is being questioned. One leading former NATO figure told the BBC this week that the VE Day celebrations felt more like a funeral. President Trump has complained that the United States is being ""ripped off"" by her allies, Vice President JD Vance has said that  America is ""bailing out"" Europe whilst Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has insisted that Europe is ""free-loading"".
Biden calls the pledge all members of Nato - the Atlantic Alliance - make ""to defend each and every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power"" a ""sacred obligation"".
""I fear that our allies around the world are going to begin to doubt whether we're going to stay where we've always been for the last 80 years,"" Biden says.
Under his presidency, both Finland and Sweden joined Nato - something he thinks made the alliance stronger.  ""We did all that - and in four years we've got a guy who wants to walk away from it all.
""I'm worried that Europe is going to lose confidence in the certainty of America, and the leadership of America in the world, to deal with not only Nato, but other matters that are of consequence.""
I meet President Biden in the place he has called home since he was a boy, the city of Wilmington in Delaware. It is an hour and a half Amtrak train ride from Washington DC, a journey he has been making for 50 years since becoming a Senator at the age of just 30. He has spent more years in government than any other president.
He was 82 when he left the Oval Office. His age has invited no end of scrutiny - an ""at times addled old man"" is how the journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson describe him in their book, Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.
His calamitous live TV debate performance last June prompted further questions, as Biden stumbled over his words, lost his thread mid-sentence and boasted, somewhat bafflingly, that ""We finally beat Medicare!"". He withdrew from the election campaign soon after.
Biden's live TV debate performance last June raised questions as he stumbled over words and appeared to lose his train of thought
Today, Biden is still warm and charismatic, with the folksy charm that made him an election winner but he is a much slower, quieter and more hesitant version of the leader he was once. Meeting with him in person, I found it hard to imagine he could have served for another four years in the White House, taking him closer to the age of 90.
I ask Biden if he's now had to think again about his decisions last year. He pulled out of the presidential race just 107 days before election day, leaving Kamala Harris limited time to put together her own campaign.
""I don't think it would have mattered,"" he says. ""We left at a time when we had a good candidate, she was fully funded.
""What we had set out to do, no-one thought we could do,"" he continues. ""And we had become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, 'No, I'm going to stop now'... It was a hard decision.""
One he regrets? Surely withdrawing earlier could have given someone else a greater chance?
""No, I think it was the right decision."" He pauses. ""I think thatâ¦ Well, it was just a difficult decision.""
Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice and to this day has lost none of his appetite for the fight. Last year at the D-Day celebrations he warned: ""We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War Two.""
Today, he expands on this: ""Look at the number of European leaders and European countries that are wondering, Well what do I do now? What's the best route for me to take? Can I rely on the United States? Are they going to be there?""
""Instead of democracy expanding around the world, [it's] receding. Democracy - every generation has to fight for it.""
Biden says he went into politics to fight injustice
Speaking in Chicago recently, Biden declared that ""nobody's king"" in America. I asked him if he thinks President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than a constitutionally limited president.
He chooses his reply carefully. ""He's not behaving like a Republican president,"" he says.
Though later in our interview, Biden admits he's less worried about the future of US democracy than he used to be, ""because I think the Republican Party is waking up to what Trump is about"".
President Biden relished his role as the leading figure in Nato, deploying normally top secret intelligence to tell a sceptical world back in 2022 that Vladimir Putin was about to launch a full scale invasion of Ukraine.
Since taking office President Trump has charted a different course, telling Ukraine that it must consider giving up territory to Russia if it wants the war to end.
""It is modern day appeasement,"" Biden says of Trump's approach.
Putin, he says, sees Ukraine as ""part of Mother Russia. He believes he has historical rights to Ukraine... He can't stand the fact that [â¦] the Soviet Union has collapsed. And anybody who thinks he's going to stop is just foolish.""
He fears that Trump's approach might signal to other European countries that it's time to give in to Russia.
Biden on Ukraine: 'We gave them everything they needed to provide for their independence'
Yet Biden has faced accusations against him concerning the Ukraine War. Some in Kyiv and her allies, as well as some in the UK, claim that he gave President Zelensky just enough support to resist invasion but not enough to defeat Russia, perhaps out of fear that Putin would consider using nuclear weapons if cornered.
When Putin was asked point blank on TV this week whether he would use nuclear weapons to win the war, he declared that he hoped that they would ""not be necessary,"" adding that he had the means to bring the war to what he called his ""logical conclusion"".
I point out to Biden that it has been argued that he didn't have the courage to go all the way to give Ukraine the weapons it needed - to let Ukraine win. 
""We gave them [Ukraine] everything they needed to provide for their independence,"" Biden argues. ""And we were prepared to respond more aggressively if in fact Putin moved again.""
He says he was keen to avoid the prospect of ""World War Three, with nuclear powers,"" adding: ""And we did avoid it.
""What would Putin do if things got really tough for him?"" he continues. ""Threaten the use of tactical nuclear weapons. This is not a game or roulette.""
Biden's belief in the Atlantic Alliance - as the last living President born during World War Two - is clearly undiminished.
When he first arrived in the Oval Office, Biden hung a portrait of America's wartime leader Franklin D. Roosevelt on the wall. He was born two and a half years before the defeat of the Nazis, into the world FDR helped to create - a world of American global leadership and solidarity. But the United States voted to reject Biden's policies and values and instead to endorse Donald Trump's call to put America First.
The world is changing from what people like Joe Biden have taken for granted.
""Every generation has to fight to maintain democracy, every one,"" Biden says. ""Every one's going to be challenged.
""We've done it well for the last 80 years. And I'm worried there's the loss of understanding of the consequences of that.""

India has announced that it will stop its water from flowing over international borders.
""Now, India's water will flow for India's benefit, it will be conserved for India's benefit, and it will be used for India's progress"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.
While he did not mention Pakistan specifically, Modi's comments come about two weeks after India suspended a 65-year-old water sharing treaty with its neighbour.
Relations between India and Pakistan have declined sharply following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir last month. India accuses Pakistan of backing cross-border terrorism - a charge Islamabad flatly denies.
On Tuesday night, India said it had launched missile strikes on nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan's military said eight people had been killed.
India said three civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling on its side of the de facto border.
Follow live: India launches air strikes on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir
Several rivers flow from India into Pakistan, providing vital water supplies to about 80% of farms there. Pakistani leaders previously warned that any attempt to stop the flow of water ""will be considered as an act of war"".
The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between India and Pakistan, survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.
Modi's suspension of the treaty was one of several steps he took against Pakistan after the attack, which killed 26 civilians.
The PM did not elaborate on how India plans to use the excess water, and experts say the country needs to build more dams, reservoirs and lakes to store it, which will take time to build. 
The escalation prompted the US to repeat its calls for calm.
""We continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,"" State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday afternoon."
631,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2y2d50plzo,2025-05-07 04:33:35,"Rosenberg: Russians remember WW2 with victory on their minds,","Eighty miles from Moscow, a park echoes to the sound of explosions and gunfire.
As plumes of thick grey smoke rise into the air, the Red Army storms across a bridge and battles for control of a tiny island. More Soviet soldiers are arriving by boat from across a lake.
Once on the island they tear down a swastika and replace it with the hammer and sickle of the Soviet Union. Victory.
A large crowd is watching from the safety of the shore. What they're witnessing is an historical re-enactment of one of the final battles for Berlin in 1945. It led to the capitulation of Nazi Germany and what Moscow still refers to as The Great Victory.
The battle for Berlin, unfolding in front of me in the town of Dubna, is one of many events in Russia for the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War Two.
Katya's grandfather died in World War Two. Today her son is fighting in Ukraine
The anniversary is receiving enormous attention in a country where the national idea is built very much around the notion of Russia as victor and victim.
""I'm here because my grandfather fought in this war,"" one of the spectators, Katya, tells me.
""He went missing near Berlin. Much later we found out he'd been killed in January 1945.""
Eighty years on Katya's son is fighting in Ukraine.
""My son is in a war now. He's in the 'special military operation',"" she tells me.  ""He volunteered. I tried to talk him out of it. But he hasn't listened to anyone since he was a kid.
'I'm my own tsar,' he told me. 'Go fight, then, if you're a tsar,' I replied. He and his friend went together. His friend was killed.""
Katya's family history is a story of different generations fighting on the front line.
But in very different circumstances.
In 1941, Hitler's Germany invaded the Soviet Union to try to conquer the world's largest country and secure world domination. Soviet soldiers (Katya's grandfather among them) fought to liberate their country from the Nazis. Victory for Moscow came at an enormous human cost: more than 27 million Soviet citizens were killed in what is known here as the Great Fatherland or Great Patriotic War.
The Moscow metro has two special ""victory trains"" 
But in 2022 it was Russia that launched a large-scale invasion - of its neighbour. What the Kremlin still calls a ""special military operation"" was widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Russia's geo-political orbit. In March 2022, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution condemning Russia's ""aggression.""
And yet the Russian authorities portray the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War Two. The official narrative here creates a parallel reality, in which Russia once again is fighting Nazism and fascism, in Ukraine and across Europe. Russia, the country which invaded Ukraine, presents itself as the victim of external aggression.
""Historically and sociologically, victory in the Great Patriotic War was always a cornerstone of Russian united consciousness,"" Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov explains, ""because there is no glue for the nation: only this event. It was always so, from Brezhnev's time until now.
""But what's happening now is something special. Now the Great Patriotic War is presented as just the first step in our permanent war with the West, against 'Eurofascism.' The Special Military Operation as the continuation of the Great Patriotic War: this is something new.""
In Russia, television plays a key role in spreading the official message that Europe couldn't be trusted then and cannot be trusted now. Recently, on Russian TV, I saw a documentary entitled ""Europe Against Russia. Hitler's Crusaders"". It was about how European countries had collaborated with the Nazis during World War Two.
No mention of the 1939 non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin: under its secret protocol Germany and the USSR had carved up spheres of influence in eastern Europe.
Last month a Russian TV presenter launched a tirade against German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a staunch supporter of military support to Ukraine. The talk show host called Germany's leader ""a Nazi scumbag"" for comments about Russia. Addressing the Chancellor directly, the anchor said that Russians ""hold you and your comrades responsible for the killing of 27 million Soviet citizens.""
A new monument in the town Khimki shows a soldier from World War Two and a soldier fighting in Ukraine
Iconography underpins the ideology. In the town of Khimki, near Moscow, a recently unveiled monument depicts a Red Army soldier side by side with a Russian who is fighting in Ukraine. Framed photos of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine have been placed below the two fighter figures.
An inscription reads: ""By preserving the past we defend the future!""
Wars past and present: brought together in bronze.
In the run up to Victory Day, Russia has been awash with reminders of The Great Victory. Last month a Soyuz rocket decorated to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome.
Back down on earth, at a maternity hospital in the Siberian city of Kemerovo, newborn babies are being dressed in miniature Red Army caps and capes.
On its Telegram channel, the hospital explained that battle clothes for babies served ""as a reminder of links between the generations, the courage of the defenders of the Fatherland and of how even the tiniest Russian citizen is part of a big history.""
In Moscow, the Russian word for 'Victory' - 'Pobeda' â is everywhere: on giant billboards, on posters in shop windows, even stuck to the side of road-sweepers. Underground, special ""victory trains"" on the Moscow Metro have been decked out with World War Two imagery and the words: ""Be proud!"" and ""Remember!""
Tanks have been rolling down Moscow's main street, Tverskaya, at rehearsals for the big 9 May parade on Red Square. In Soviet times, after 1945, military parades on Victory Day were rare. Under Vladimir Putin they have become a key element of what is now Russia's most sacred national holiday - a day not only for remembering the victims of World War Two, but for showcasing Russian military power and to unite the people around the idea of Russia as an unbeatable nation.
The USSR was, indeed, victorious in the Great Patriotic War. But eighty years on, and despite confident pronouncements by Russian officials, victory eludes Moscow in Ukraine. The Kremlin's ""special military operation"" was only expected to last a few days, a few weeks maximum. After more than three years of war â and huge casualties on both sides - it's still unclear how and when the fighting will end.
Fyodor Melnikov lost his brother to war
The Kremlin says 29 world leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, will be attending the Victory Day parade. According to Moscow, Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be visiting Russia for the commemorations. Ensuring security for the military parade and guests on Red Square will already have been a top priority for the Kremlin. Even more so after two consecutive nights of Ukrainian drone attacks targeting Moscow.
Back in Dubna, German resistance has crumbled and the Red Army is in full control. The re-enactment is over.
Some of the spectators here believe the official portrayal of Russia as a besieged fortress threatened by the West.
""Both Britain and America have betrayed us and threaten us,"" Lidiya tells me. ""But we are resilient. You cannot defeat Russia.""
When I talk to 98-year-old Fyodor Melnikov, he doesn't get into politics. The military show has sparked painful memories for him. Fyodor's brother was killed in the Great Patriotic War.
""War is a terrifying thing,"" Fyodor tells me. ""People should be allowed to live freely. Let them work, let them live their lives, let them die naturally.""
Fyodor has written a poem about his late brother, about war. He recites it for me. In translation it sounds like this:
""A uniform I never wore, 
A battle I never saw.
But in my mind's eye I see
My brother going off to war.
The only thing he said to me
Before he went was this:
'Live, little brother, be well.'
I will bring victory home.""
On Friday, along with the whole of Russia, Fyodor Melnikov will be celebrating the 80th anniversary of The Great Victory of 1945.
But it will be a day for remembering, too: friends and family who never returned.
A day for acknowledging the cost of war.

Five Venezuelan political figures holed up at the Argentinian Embassy in Caracas to avoid arrest have been brought to the US after a ""successful rescue"" mission, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
""The US welcomes the successful rescue of all hostages held by the Maduro regime at the Argentinian Embassy in Caracas,"" Rubio wrote in a post on X. ""Following a precise operation, all hostages are now safely on US soil.""
Venezuelan forces had surrounded the embassy since last year, where the five politicians opposed to President NicolÃ¡s Maduro had been taking refuge.
Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado said she was thankful ""to all those who made it possible"".
Machado hailed their escape as ""an impeccable and epic operation for the freedom of five heroes"".
They were given permission to stay there by the government of Argentine President Javier Milei, whose country is among several that have disputed the results of Venezuela's last election in July that gave Maduro a third term.
The Argentine foreign ministry thanked Rubio and the US government ""for the successful operation that secured the freedom of the Venezuelan asylum seekers at our Embassy in Caracas"".
Last year, the opposition figures posted images and videos of officers from the country's intelligence service surrounding the embassy complex, saying they were under ""siege"".  
They also accused the Venezuelan government of cutting electricity and water services to the compound.
The Venezuelan government said at the time that it had been forced to take action after it supposedly uncovered evidence of ""terrorist activities and assassination attempts"" against Maduro and his deputy.
In November, the US called the security operations outside the embassy a serious violation of international law.
""We demand that the Venezuelan regime respect its international obligations, cease these intimidating actions and guarantee safe passage for asylum seekers,"" the US embassy in Venezuela said at the time.
Rubio did not confirm the names of those who were rescued, but the five opposition members who had been sheltering at the Argentine embassy are Magalli Meda, Pedro Urruchurtu, Omar Gonzalez, Humberto Villalobos and Claudia Macero.
It is unclear how the five managed to leave the compound, and what role the US played in their escape.
The embassy they sheltered in had been represented and guarded by Brazil since diplomatic relations between Argentina and Venezuela broke down last summer due to the outcome of Venezuela's presidential election.
But in September, the Venezuelan government revoked Brazil's custody of the embassy in an apparent attempt to remove its diplomatic protection."

The younger half brother of US vice-president JD Vance will face off with the Democratic incumbent in Cincinnati's mayoral race in November, after finishing second in a primary on Tuesday.
Cory Bowman, 36, who shares a father with the vice-president, is running as a Republican in the Ohio city. 
The political newcomer received an endorsement earlier on Tuesday from Vance, who wrote on X that Bowman is ""a good guy with a heart for serving his community.""
Bowman, a pastor at an evangelical church in Cincinnati, will now run against current mayor Aftab Pureval in November's general election.
Results indicate he received around 13% of the vote in Tuesday's primary, well below Pureval who got around 83%.
But it was enough to have Bowman finish second ahead of another Republican candidate, Brian Frank. The two candidates with the most votes go on to run for mayor in the fall. 
Bowman, who also co-owns a coffee shop in Cincinnati, said he was inspired to run after attending Trump and Vance's inauguration.
But he has told the Associated Press that his political journey is separate from his brother's.
""As far as the relationship with JD, I tell people he's my brother, he's not a political counsellor to me,"" Bowman said. ""He is not somebody that planted me here in this city.""
""There was nobody that pushed me into it, nobody that told me that this is a pathway I should go,"" he added. ""But I just thought this would be a great way to help impact the city in another realm as well, because that's always been the focus.""
The Republican has campaigned on removing Cincinnati's designation as a sanctuary city - a term used for cities that shield migrants from federal law enforcement. He also has spoken about tackling ""financial corruption"" and bolstering safety.
Despite the notoriety of his older brother, political watchers note that November's race will be uphill for Bowman.
Cincinnati has traditionally been run by Democratic mayors, making it a difficult campaign for any Republican. The city has not elected a Republican mayor in over 50 years."

A senior Hamas official has said the armed group is not interested in further talks on a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal while Israel continues what he called its ""starvation war"".
Israel cut off all humanitarian aid from entering Gaza nine weeks ago and later resumed its military offensive, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release hostages.
But Bassem Naim said there was ""no point in any negotiations"" while the blockade remained in place.
His comments came after Israel's security cabinet approved an expanded offensive which could see the forced displacement of most of Gaza's 2.1 million population and occupation of all of the Palestinian territory indefinitely.
Israel also intends to replace the current aid delivery and distribution system with one channelled through private companies and military hubs.
The UN's humanitarian office has rejected that idea, saying it does not live up to fundamental humanitarian principles and ""appears to be a deliberate attempt to weaponize the aid"".
On Monday, the Israeli military's spokesman said its expanded ground offensive in Gaza would seek to bring home the remaining 59 hostages, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive, and achieve the ""dismantling and decisive defeat of the Hamas regime"".
The operation would take place on a ""wide scale"" and involve ""the movement of the majority of the Gaza Strip's population - in order to protect them in a Hamas-free zone"", he added.
An Israeli official briefed the media that the offensive would also include ""holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, [and] denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies"".
A second official said it would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region next week, providing what he called ""a window of opportunity"" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Bassem Naim's comments on Tuesday seemed to counter that.
""There is no point in any negotiations or engagement with new proposals while [Israel] continues its starvation war against our people in the Gaza Strip - a war that the international community, including UN institutions, has deemed a war crime in itself,"" he said.
Hamas also put out a separate statement telling Israeli ministers that their approval of the expanded offensive represented ""an explicit decision to sacrifice"" Israeli hostages.
There was no immediate response from the Israeli government, but far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told a conference that an Israeli victory in Gaza would see the territory ""entirely destroyed"" and its residents ""concentrated"" in the south, from where they would ""start to leave in great numbers to third countries"".
UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned that expanded Israeli ground operations and a prolonged military presence would ""inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza"".
France's Foreign Minister, Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot, said Israel's plans were ""unacceptable"" and that its government was ""in violation of humanitarian law"".
In Washington, Trump said the US would help supply food to people in Gaza, without going into details.
""People are starving and we're going to help them get some food,"" he said. ""Hamas is making it impossible because they're taking everything that's brought in.""
Israel cut off all deliveries of aid and other supplies on 2 March and resumed its offensive on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire that saw 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
Israel has also accused Hamas of stealing and storing aid - an allegation the group has denied.
But aid agencies have warned that mass starvation is imminent unless the blockade ends.
The Israeli military said the aim of the offensive was to bring the remaining hostages home and ensure Hamas's ""decisive defeat""
The UN and its humanitarian partners have said Israeli authorities are seeking to shut down the existing aid distribution system run by them and are asking them to agree to deliver supplies ""through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military"".
Israeli Army Radio reported on Tuesday that Israel was proposing to distribute aid from three distribution centres in the southern governorate of Rafah, which is currently covered by an Israeli evacuation order and cut off from the rest of the territory by a new military corridor.
It said a representative from each family in Gaza would be allowed to go to the centres to receive a week's supply of food - estimated to be about 70kg (154lb) on average - in order to prevent starvation. They would be screened to ensure Hamas members did not enter.
The report said the distribution would be managed by American organisations and private companies, rather than Israeli troops. It added that aid would not be distributed anywhere else in Gaza, which might hasten the movement of the population southwards.
A spokesman for the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the Israeli plan ""appears designed to further control and restrict supplies, which is the opposite of what is needed"", adding that aid should never be used as a way of forcing populations to move.
Jens Laerke told a news conference in Geneva that the UN would not co-operate with the plan because it would ""not live up to the core fundamental humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independent delivery of aid"".
""Impartiality means aid is provided on needs alone, not based on trying to get people to go somewhere,"" he said. ""Then neutral and independent: it is extremely important that [those receiving aid] see a neutral provider that they have nothing to fear from.""
The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure food and medical supplies for Gaza's population. Israel has said it is complying with international law and there is no aid shortage because thousands of lorry loads entered during the ceasefire.
One Palestinian man in Gaza said he believed Israel's proposal was ""camouflage"" and that it ""has no intention of allowing aid into"" the territory.
""This is the basic principle Israel is working on - to prolong the blockade until Gaza reaches an aggravated stage of famine,"" he told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme.
But another man said his ""first and last concern"" was receiving the supplies his family needed to survive, adding: ""What really matters to us is that we want to live, eat, and go on with life.""
Israel's resumed bombardment and ground operations over the past seven weeks have already resulted in hundreds of casualties and the displacement of an estimated 423,000 people, with about 70% of Gaza placed under Israeli evacuation orders, within an Israel-designated ""no-go"" zone, or both, according to the UN.
On Tuesday, officials from the Hamas-run civil defence agency said Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 37 people. 
Strikes included Israel bombing a UN-run school in Bureij refugee camp that was being used as a shelter for displaced families, killing 31 people and injuring dozens more, Gaza's civil defence agency told AFP. Children and women were among those killed. 
The Israeli military said it ""struck terrorists who were operating within a Hamas command-and-control centre"". Hamas denounced the attack as a ""horrific massacre"".
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,615 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,507 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

Newly-released audio reveals the moment air traffic controllers at one of New York's busiest airports lost communications with planes under their control - leaving one pilot asking, ""Approach, are you there?"".
The pilot called out five separate times over a span of 30 seconds before the control tower was able to respond, the audio recorded by LiveATC.net reveals.
The tense moments at Newark Liberty International Airport led to multiple employees going on trauma leave, contributing to hundreds of delayed flights.
US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that communications were lost for 30 seconds, and that no planes were in danger. 
A few others have estimated that contact was lost for up to 90 seconds. 
""That's 90 seconds of a wholly filled-up sky of planes literally flying blind over one of America's busiest airports,"" said New York Senator Chuck Schumer on Tuesday.  ""Thank God nothing happened, but we tempt fate if no changes are made.""
The audio released on Tuesday by LiveATC.net is between an air traffic control tower in Philadelphia, and pilots flying in the area around one of New York's busiest travel hubs.
""Approach, are you there?"" one pilot arriving from New Orleans says, to no response. After five further attempts, over thirty seconds, the tower responds: ""I got you loud and clear.""
At another point, the control tower tells a United Airlines pilot: ""I am gonna move you here because I just got told that the approach lost all the radars."" 
""Three of their four radar screens went black and they have no frequencies.""
The pilot is heard calmly responding: ""Alright, we're ready to move.""
The incident on 28 April contributed to hundreds of delayed flights that continued into Tuesday.
Secretary Duffy said the outage was ""a sign that we have a frail system in place, and it has to be fixed"".
The Federal Aviation Administration also acknowledged in a statement that ""our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our work force"".
Air traffic control operations at the airport in New Jersey have come under sustained criticism recently.
Last week, United Airlines announced it was cancelling 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule because the airport ""cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there""."

On Wednesday evening, under the domed ceiling of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, 133 cardinals will vote to elect the Catholic Church's 267th pope.
The day will begin at 10:00 (09:00 BST) with a mass in St Peter's Basilica. The service, which will be televised, will be presided over by Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old Cardinal Dean who was also the celebrant of Pope Francis' funeral.
In the early afternoon, mobile signal within the territory of the Vatican will be deactivated to prevent anyone taking part in the conclave from contacting the outside world.
Around 16:15 (15:15 BST), the 133 cardinal electors will gather in the Pauline Chapel and form a procession to the Sistine Chapel.
All the while they will be singing a litany and the hymn Veni Creator - an invocation to the Holy Spirit, which is seen as the guiding hand that will help cardinals choose the new Pope.
Once in the Sistine Chapel, one hand resting on a copy of the Gospel, the cardinals will pronounce the prescribed oath of secrecy which precludes them from ever sharing details about how the new Pope was elected.
Follow the latest updates
How the Vatican keeps its pap vote secret
When the last of the electors has taken the oath, a meditation will be held. Then, the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations Diego Ravelli will announce ""extra omnes"" (""everybody out"").
He is one of three ecclesiastical staff allowed to stay in the Sistine Chapel despite not being a cardinal elector, even though they will have to leave the premises during the counting of the votes.
The moment ""extra omnes"" is pronounced marks the start of the cardinals' isolation â and the start of the conclave.
The word, which comes from the Latin for ""cum clave"", or ""locked with key"" is slightly misleading, as the cardinals are no longer locked inside; rather, on Tuesday Vatican officials closed the entrances to the Apostolic Palace â which includes the Sistine Chapel- with lead seals which will remain until the end of the proceedings. Swiss guards will also flank all the entrances to the chapel.
Cardinals gathered during the funeral of Pope Francis at Saint Peter's Square in Vatican in April
Diego Ravelli will distribute ballot papers, and the cardinals will proceed to the first vote soon after.
While nothing forbids the Pope from being elected with the first vote, it has not happened in centuries. Still, that first ballot is very important, says Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic writer and commentator.
""The cardinals who have more than 20 votes will be taken into consideration. In the first ballot the votes will be very scattered and the electors know they have to concentrate on the ones that have numbers,"" says Ivereigh.
He adds that every other ballot thereafter will indicate which of the cardinals have the momentum. ""It's almost like a political campaignâ¦ but it's not really a competition; it's an effort by the body to find consensus.""
If the vote doesn't yield the two-third majority needed to elect the new pope, the cardinals go back to guesthouse Casa Santa Marta for dinner. It is then, on the sidelines of the voting process, that important conversations among the cardinals take place and consensus begins to coalesce around different names.
According to Italian media, the menu options consist of light dishes which are usually served to guests of the residence, and includes wine â but no spirits. The waiters and kitchen staff are also sworn to secrecy and cannot leave the grounds for the duration of the conclave.
Pope Francis died at the age of 88 on Easter Monday 2025
From Thursday morning, cardinals will be taking breakfast between 06:30 (05:30 BST) and 07:30 (06:30 BST) ahead of mass at 08:15 (07:15 BST). Two votes then take place in the morning, followed by lunch and rest. In his memoirs, Pope Francis said that was when he began to receive signals from the other cardinals that serious consensus was beginning to form around him; he was elected during the first afternoon vote. The last two conclaves have all concluded by the end of the second day.
There is no way of knowing at this stage whether this will be a long or a short conclave â but cardinals are aware that dragging the proceedings on could be interpreted as a sign of gaping disagreements.
As they discuss, pray and vote, outside the boarded-up windows of the Sistine Chapel thousands of faithful will be looking up to the chimney to the right of St Peter's Basilica, waiting for the white plume of smoke to signal that the next pope has been elected."

Friedrich Merz's initial, shock defeat - in his bid to become chancellor - sparked hours of chaotic uncertainty.
A man who'd been working to project strength and purpose instead became mired in political intrigue and division.
Merz may have won on the second try, but today's messy path to power raises serious questions about the future government.
If he couldn't muster the votes amongst coalition colleagues - at such a key moment - how will he fare when trying to push through any contentious legislation?
It comes as Germany faces a prolonged recession, fractious arguments on immigration, potentially seismic decisions on defence spending and a surging far-right political force.
But Merz's allies insist the situation can quickly be recovered and reject the idea that Merz emerges irreparably damaged.
""Now we are looking in front and forward,"" says Gunther Krichbaum, a veteran of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and Germany's new Europe Minister.
""So I think we will have a very, very good and also stable government,"" he told the BBC. 
""This is not only necessary for Germany but also Europe.""
Friedrich Merz, right, with his predecessor Olaf Scholz
Berlin's allies have been impatient to see an effective administration, after the bickering that characterised the last, collapsed coalition government.
But Merz now heads off for his planned trips to Warsaw and Paris on Wednesday in the shadow of a tumultuous Tuesday.
There's speculation aplenty as to which MPs, in the secret ballot, didn't back Merz on the first round - and why.
Disgruntled people, passed over for government jobs, is one theory.
Did members within the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) decide that they had to protest at the political compromises struck with Merz's centre-right party?
Or did the forthright Merz - and ambitious SPD Vice-Chancellor Lars Klingbeil - struggle to rally their own ranks?
Figures from both sides were quickly keen to suggest that the other was chiefly to blame.
Whichever MPs did the deed they were, it seems, willing to risk making Merz and his acolytes sweat.
Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD), who are suing Germany's domestic intelligence service for classing the party as extremist, had a ringside seat for the whole show.
Following February's election, the AfD is the main opposition party and pounced on events as evidence of the fundamental weaknesses within a coalition made up of the centre-right CDU/CSU parties and centre-left SPD.
""It is very clear that this government... will be a very, very unstable one,"" says Beatrix von Storch, the AfD's deputy group leader.
She also echoed claims that it was all further proof that the so-called ""firewall"" of non-cooperation with her party will not last.
""This has shown that this firewall has to fall if you want to have a shift in politics in Germany,"" von Storch told the BBC.
Also watching on from the Reichstag's visitors' gallery was Merz's old political rival from within the CDU, former chancellor Angela Merkel.
He once lost out to her in a power struggle but returned later to politics - to try and realise his long-held dream of taking the top job.
This can't have been the way in which Merz envisioned entering office.
But, more importantly, the spectacle leaves his claims of being ready to provide firm government, significantly undermined on day one."

As the sun set over Lake Turkana, a mother sobbed and threw flowers into the greenish-blue water to remember her teenage daughter who had drowned trying to reach Kenya via a new route being used by people smugglers.
Senait Mebrehtu, a Pentecostal Christian Eritrean who had sought asylum in Kenya three years ago, made the pilgrimage to north-western Kenya to see for herself where 14-year-old Hiyab had lost her life last year.
The girl had been travelling with her sister, who survived the late-night crossing over the vast lake, where winds can be powerful.
""If the smugglers told me there was such a big and dangerous lake in Kenya, I wouldn't have let my daughters come this far,"" Ms Senait told the BBC as she sat on the western shoreline.
Ms Senait had arrived by plane in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, on a tourist visa with her two younger children, fleeing religious persecution. But she was not allowed to travel with her two other daughters at the time as they were older and nearer the age of conscription.
Eritrea is a highly militarised, one-party country - and often national service can go on for years and can include forced labour.
The teenagers begged to join her in Kenya, so she consulted relatives who told her they would pay smugglers to get the girls out of Eritrea.
The fate of the two girls was put into the hands of traffickers who took them on a weeks-long trip by road and foot from Eritrea into neighbouring Ethiopia - then to the south into Kenya to the north-eastern shores of Lake Turkana, the world's largest permanent desert lake.
A female smuggler in Kenya confirmed to the BBC that Lake Turkana was increasingly being used as an illegal crossing for the migrants.
""We call it the digital route because it is very new,"" she said.
The trafficker, who earns around $1,500 (Â£1,130) for each migrant she traffics into or through Kenya (four times the average monthly salary of a Kenyan worker), spoke to us about her work at a secret location and on condition of anonymity.
For the last 15 years she has been part of a huge smuggling network that operates across Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa - mainly moving those fleeing Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.
With Kenya having stepped up patrols on its roads, smugglers are now turning to Lake Turkana to get migrants into the country.
""Agents"" on the new route, she said, received the migrants in the Kenyan fishing village of Lomekwi where road transport was organised to take them to Nairobi - a journey of about 15 hours.
Warning of the dangers of travelling on the rickety wooden boats, she appealed to parents not to allow their children to make the crossing alone.
""I won't say I love the money I make - because as a mother I can't be happy when I see bad things happening to other women's children,"" she told the BBC.
""I'd like to advise migrants if they'll listen to me. I'd like to beg them to stay in their countries,"" she said, further cautioning of the callous attitudes of many traffickers.
Lake Turkana is the world's largest permanent desert lake
Osman, an Eritrean migrant who did not want to give his real name for security reasons, made the crossing at the same time as Hiyab and her sister.
He recalled how Hiyab's boat capsized in front of his eyes not long after leaving the fishing village of Ileret as it was heading south-west to Lomekwi.
""Hiyab was in the boat in front of us - its motor wasn't working and it was being propelled by a strong wind,"" he said.
""They were about 300m [984ft] into the water when their boat overturned, resulting in the deaths of seven people.""
Hiyab's sister survived by clinging to the sinking boat until another vessel - also operated by the smugglers - came to the rescue.
Ms Senait blamed the smugglers for the deaths, saying they overloaded the boat with more than 20 migrants.
""The cause of deaths was plain negligence. They put too many people in a small boat that couldn't even carry five people,"" she said.
During the BBC's visit to Lomewki, two fishermen said they saw the bodies of migrants - believed to be Eritreans - floating in the lake, which is around 300km (186 miles) long and 50km wide, in July 2024.
""There were about four bodies on the shores. Then, a few days later other bodies appeared,"" Brighton Lokaala said.
Another fisherman, Joseph Lomuria, said he saw the bodies of two men and two women - one of whom appeared to be a teenager.
In June 2024, the UN's refugee agency, UNHCR, recorded 345,000 Eritrean refugees and asylum seekers in East Africa, out of 580,000 globally.
Like Ms Senait's family, many flee to avoid military conscription in a country that has been embroiled in numerous wars in the region, and where free political and religious activity is not tolerated as the government tries to keep a tight grip on power.
Uganda-based Eritrean lawyer, Mula Berhan, told the BBC that Kenya and Uganda were increasingly becoming the preferred destination of these migrants because of conflict in Ethiopia and Sudan, which both neighbour Eritrea.
The female smuggler said in her experience some of the migrants settled in Kenya, but others used the country as a transit point to reach Uganda, Rwanda and South Africa, believing it easier to get refugee status there.
The smuggling network operates in all these countries, handing over migrants to different ""agents"" until they reach their final destination, which - in some cases - can also be Europe or North America.
Her job is to hand over those migrants who are in transit in Nairobi to agents who keep them in ""holding houses"" until the next leg of their trip is arranged and paid for.
By this stage each migrant has probably paid around $5,000 for the journey up to that point.
The BBC saw a room in a block of flats that was being used as a holding house. Five Eritrean men were locked inside the room, which had just a single mattress.
In the holding houses, migrants are expected to pay rent and also pay for their food - and the smuggler said she knew of three men and a young woman who had died of hunger as they had run out of cash.
She said the agents simply disposed of the bodies and called their deaths bad luck.
""Smugglers keep lying to the families saying their people are alive, and they keep on sending money,"" she acknowledged.
Female migrants, she said, were often sexually abused or forced to get married to male smugglers.
She said she herself had no intention of giving up the lucrative trade but felt others should be aware of what could lie ahead of them.
It is little comfort for Ms Senait, who still mourns the death of her 14-year-old while expressing relief that her elder daughter survived and was unharmed by the smugglers.
""We have gone through what every Eritrean family is going through,"" she said.
""May God heal our land and deliver us from all this.""

Carney won the election last month promising to ""stand up"" to Trump, who has imposed tariffs on some Canadian products and sometimes talks about annexing the country.
The former central banker responded with a firm but measured tone after the president proposed a ""wonderful marriage"" of incorporating Canada into the US.
Despite a strained relationship recently between the once-close neighbours, the two men also lavished praise on each other in what was a largely cordial Oval Office meeting.
Trump has imposed general tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico and sector-specific import taxes on cars, some of which have been suspended pending negotiations. 
The US president, who accuses Canada of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl south, has levied similar duties on steel and aluminium.
Tuesday's meeting was the first time the two had met since Carney won Canada's general election on 28 April, a victory many have credited to concerns in that country about Trump. 
Live updates from Carney-Trump meeting
But the two leaders began with warm words, with Trump describing Carney as ""a very talented person"". 
He also hailed his guest's election win as ""one of the greatest comebacks in the history of politics, maybe even greater than mine"".
Carney said Trump was a ""transformational president"", with ""a relentless focus on the American worker, securing your border, and securing the world"" and said he had ""revitalised"" Nato.
But friction arose when Trump again argued that Canada would be better off as part of the US. 
Carney came prepared with a carefully worded response. 
""As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,"" he told property magnate Trump, likening Canada to the Oval Office itself and to Britain's Buckingham Palace.
""Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign in the last several months, it's not for sale. Won't be for sale, ever.""
Trump replied: ""Never say never.""
The US leader traced his own red line when a journalist in the Oval Office asked if Carney could say anything to persuade him to lift tariffs.
""No,"" he replied. ""It's just the way it is.""
""This was a very friendly conversation,"" he added. ""But we want to make our own cars."" 
Trump once again argued that the US was subsidising Canada's military and did not need Canadian goods such as aluminium and steel. 
He said he and Carney would discuss ""tough points"" at their meeting, but ""regardless of anything, we're going to be friends with Canada"".
Trump also criticised his visitor's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, with whom he had an adversarial relationship. 
Still, he said the meeting with Carney was in stark contrast to another recent Oval Office ""blow-up"" - a reference to a disastrous visit from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky in February. 
Notably, Trump also downplayed the prospect of trade deals, even though his administration has repeatedly pointed to the over 80 countries the White House says are hoping to negotiate as a sign of progress.
""Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?,"" Trump said. ""We don't have to sign deals, they have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market. We don't want a piece of their market."" 
Carney said that he ""pressed the case"" to Trump on lifting tariffs, and found him to be ""willing to have that negotiation"". 
""I think that's the main thing. That doesn't presuppose the outcome of the negotiation,"" Carney added at a  news conference at the Canadian embassy in Washington DC. ""There'll be zigs and zags. Difficult aspects to it. But the prospect is there."" 
Carney did not speculate on timing, saying only that both leaders and their teams would speak again in the coming weeks. 
Additionally, Carney said he again asked that Trump stopped calling for Canada to become a US state. He added that he believed it important to distinguish between ""wish and reality"".
""He's the president. He's his own person,"" Carney said. ""He understands that we're having a negotiation between sovereign nations."" 
During Canada's election campaign, Carney argued he was the leader who could fight Trump's ""betrayal"", as well as push back against US threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty. 
In his victory speech, the Liberal leader went as far as to say that the formerly tight US-Canadian relationship was ""over"" and that Canadians must ""fundamentally re-imagine our economy"" in the Trump era.
More than $760bn (Â£570bn)  in goods flowed between Canada and the US last year. Canada is the US' second-largest individual trading partner after Mexico, and the largest export market for US goods."

Opposition parties have criticised the new UK-India trade deal, saying it could undercut British workers.
One aspect of the free trade agreement, which Labour says will be worth Â£5bn a year to the UK, is extending an exemption on national insurance contributions (Nics) from one to three years.
Known as the double contribution convention, this means people on short-term visas will not make social security payments in both the country they work in, and their home country, when working abroad.
Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Reform have claimed this could mean Indian workers become cheaper to hire than British workers - particularly when UK employer Nics have just been increased.
The Indian government said the exemption, external was a ""huge win"" and an ""unprecedented achievement"" that ""will make Indian service providers significantly more competitive in the UK"".
The UK has 16 agreements, external preventing double taxation of work, which cover more than 50 countries - including the US, EU and South Korea - and workers will still be required to pay the NHS immigration surcharge.
Defending the deal, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the arrangement was limited and only applied to inter-company transfers of professionals between the UK and India. 
""This is something we have with a great deal of countries already,"" he said.
""It's very specific as to who this applies to, and obviously if people were in the UK they would still be paying income tax, they would still be paying, for instance, the health surcharge and they wouldn't be eligible for benefits from the National Insurance system.""
Reynolds added that he believed the cost of the double contribution convention, as part of the trade deal, would be a ""net positive"" to the UK Treasury. 
The exemption will also apply to British staff, who are increasingly working away from home in India for large corporations.
However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch claimed she had refused a similar trade-off when she was business secretary, because the deal contains ""two-tier taxes"" which will cost the UK ""hundreds of millions"".
""I had this deal on the table as trade secretary and I refused to sign it because that double taxation agreement was unfair,"" she said. 
""It basically encourages workers from India but does not provide the same benefit to UK citizens.""
Pushed on the fact the UK has similar arrangements with other countries, Badenoch stressed that in those cases there were equivalent numbers of UK nationals working in those countries, whereas that was not the case with India, making the agreement ""very lopsided"" which would result in being a ""net cost to the Treasury.""
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the National Insurance plans were ""half-baked"" and risked damaging UK businesses' competitiveness, particularly  in light of the global trade turmoil sparked by US President Donald Trump.
""This deal risks undercutting British workers at a time when they're already being hammered by Trump's trade war and Labour's misguided jobs tax,"" she said.
""The government's failure to even publish an impact assessment of these changes gives the impression of something that is completely half-baked.
""It shows exactly why Parliament needs the opportunity to debate and vote on trade deals,"" Cooper said.
Reform UK leader Nigel Farage described the deal as ""truly appalling"", adding: ""This government doesn't give a damn about working people. 
""The Labour Party has, this time in a big, big way, betrayed working Britain.""
A Labour Party spokesperson said Indian nationals applying for jobs based in the UK would not benefit from the convention, so the tax break does not disadvantage UK workers.
""This deal will provide an annual Â£4.8bn boost for British businesses, create more jobs, raise wages by more than Â£2 billion a year and bring down prices for hard-pressed consumers,"" the spokesperson said.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis that ""we are on the eve of an intense entry into Gaza."" Israel would, he said, capture territory and hold it: ""They will not enter and come out."" 
The new offensive is calculated, according to the spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Brigadier-General Effie Defrin, to bring back the remaining hostages. After that, he told Israeli radio, ""comes the collapse of the Hamas regime, its defeat, its submission"".
The offensive will not start, Israel says, until after Donald Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar next week. Assuming Trump does not dissuade Israel from going ahead, Israel will need a military and political miracle to pull off the results described by Brig-Gen Defrin.
It is more likely that the offensive will sharpen everything that makes the Gaza war so controversial. The war, starting with the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023, has taken the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis to a point as dangerous as any in its long history. Prolonging the war divides Israelis, kills even more Palestinian civilians and horrifies millions around the world, including many who describe themselves as friends of Israel.
While the IDF attacks Hamas in Gaza, the government's plan is that its soldiers will force some or all of the more than two million Palestinian civilians in Gaza into a small area in the ruins of the south. Humanitarian aid would be distributed, perhaps by contractors including American private security firms. The United Nations humanitarian agencies have said they will not cooperate, condemning the plan as a violation of the principles of humanitarian aid.
They have also warned of starvation in Gaza caused by Israel's decision more than two months ago to block all humanitarian deliveries. Israel's blockade, which continues, has been widely condemned, not just by the UN and Arab countries.
Israel has not let any food or other supplies enter Gaza for more than two months
Now, Britain and the European Union both say they are against a new Israeli offensive. A fortnight ago, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France and Germany, all allies of Israel who regard Hamas as a terrorist group, warned that the ""intolerable"" blockade put Palestinian civilians, including one million children, at ""an acute risk of starvation, epidemic disease and death"".
The ministers also warned, implicitly, that their ally was violating international law.
""Humanitarian aid must never be used as a political tool and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change"", they insisted. ""Israel is bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.""
Israel denies it violates international humanitarian law and the laws of war in Gaza. But at the same time its own ministers' words suggest otherwise. One of many examples: the defence minister Israel Katz has described the blockade as a ""main pressure lever"" against Hamas. That sounds like an admission that the blockade is a weapon, even though it starves civilians, which amounts to a war crime.
Countries and organisations that believe Israel systematically violates its legal obligations, committing a series of war crimes, will scour any new offensive for more evidence. Extreme language used by ministers will have been noted by the South African lawyers arguing the case at the International Court of Justice alleging Israeli genocide in Gaza.
Much of it has come from ultra-nationalists who prop up the Netanyahu government. They see the new offensive as another step towards expelling Palestinians from Gaza and replacing them with Jewish settlers.
One of the most vocal extremists, Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister said that in six months Gaza would be ""totally destroyed"". Palestinians in the territory would be ""despairing, understanding that there is no hope and nothing to look for in Gaza, and will be looking for relocation to begin a new life in other places"".
""Relocation"", the word used by Smotrich, will be seen both by his supporters and political enemies as another reference to ""transfer"", an idea discussed since the earliest days of Zionism to force Arabs out of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.
Israeli bombardment has killed more than 2,500 Palestinians in Gaza since 18 March, health officials say
Netanyahu's Israeli critics say prolonging the war with a new offensive instead of ending it with a ceasefire is about his own political survival, not Israel's safety or the return of its hostages. In the days after the 7 October attacks there were lines of cars hurriedly parked outside military bases as Israelis rushed to volunteer for reserve duty to fight Hamas. 
Now thousands of them (some estimates from the Israeli left are higher) are refusing to do any more reserve duty. They argue the prime minister is continuing the war because if he doesn't his hard right will bring down the government and bring on the day of reckoning for mistakes and miscalculations Netanyahu made that gave Hamas an opportunity to attack.
Inside Israel, the sharpest criticism of the planned offensive has come from the families of the hostages who fear they have been abandoned by the government that claims to be rescuing them. Hamas still has 24 living hostages in the Gaza Strip, according to Israel, and is holding the bodies of another 35 of the 251 taken on 7 October. The Netanyahu government has claimed repeatedly that only as much military pressure as possible will get the survivors home and return the bodies of the dead to their families.
In reality, the biggest releases of hostages have come during ceasefires. The last ceasefire deal, which Trump insisted Israel sign in the final days of the Biden administration, included a planned second phase which was supposed to lead to the release of all the hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. 
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (r) says that within six months Gaza will be ""totally destroyed""
Netanyahu's extremist allies told him they would bring down his government if he agreed to a second phase of the ceasefire. First, Israel blocked humanitarian aid to put pressure, it said, on Hamas to agree to a renegotiated deal that would give Israel the option of going back to war even after the hostages were released. When Hamas refused, Israel went on the offensive again with a massive air attack on the night of 18 March.
Since then, Israel has put unrelenting pressure on Palestinians in Gaza. A new offensive will kill many more Palestinian civilians, deepen the misery of the survivors and bereaved inside Gaza and widen the toxic rifts within Israel. On its own, without a ceasefire deal, it is unlikely on past form to force Hamas to free the remaining hostages.
The carnage inflicted by Israel inside Gaza has been a recruiting sergeant for Hamas and other armed groups, according to President Joe Biden's administration just before it left office in January of this year. It is worth repeating the words used by Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in a speech in Washington on 14 January.
""We assess that Hamas has recruited almost as many new militants as it has lost,"" Blinken said. ""That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war."" 
When he spoke, Israel was claiming that it had killed around 18,000 Palestinian fighters inside Gaza. More have been killed since then, and many more civilians.
Israel's massive onslaught broke the back of Hamas as a structured military organisation more than a year ago. Now Israel faces an insurgency, which history shows can go for as long as recruits are prepared to fight and die to beat their enemy."

An 81-year-old hunter in France has been fined and handed a four-month suspended jail sentence for killing an endangered bear in the Pyrenees mountains.
The man said he had ""no other option"" but to open fire on the brown bear when it attacked him during a boar-hunt in 2021.
Fifteen other hunters were also fined and must collectively pay more than â¬60,000 (Â£51,000) in damages to environmental associations that had filed a civil suit against them.
The 150kg female bear, nicknamed Caramelles, has since been preserved by a taxidermist and is on display at the Toulouse Natural History Museum.
The Foix Criminal Court heard that the group were boar-hunting in the Pyrenees, the mountain range that separates southern France and Spain, when two bear cubs emerged. 
Shortly afterwards their mother appeared, charging at the man and dragging him several metres, before he shot and killed the animal.
""She grabbed my left thigh, I panicked and fired a shot. She backed away growling, she went around me and bit my right calf, I fell, she was eating my leg,"" he told the court. 
""I reloaded my rifle and fired.""
The shooting happened in the Mont Valier nature reserve near the village of Seix, AriÃ¨ge. Prosecutors said they should not have been there in the first place, because it was 1,300ft (396m) outside an authorised hunting area.
But the defence lawyer for 14 of the hunters, Fanny Campagne, criticised ""the lack of signs indicating that hunting was prohibited"".
The shooter was fined â¬750, his rifle has been confiscated and his hunting licence revoked.
In a statement, bear-preservation association Pays de l'ours said the verdict ""seems justified"".
""All the hunters were found guilty, which is the most important thing for us,"" the association's president, Sabine Matraire, was quoted as saying in Le Monde. 
""We hope that this ruling will be followed by a raising of awareness among the hunting community,"" she added.
Brown bear populations saw a sharp decline in the Pyrenees, with only about 70 left in 1954, according to the region's tourism board, external.
But numbers have slowly climbed up since 1990s when three bears were brought over from Slovenia as part of a reintroduction programme. 
In 2024, the French Office for Biodiversity, external estimated that the mountain range is now home to about 96 bears.

Under the plans, imports of all Russian gas and liquefied natural gas to European Union member states will be banned by the end of 2027.
""No more will we permit Russia to weaponise energy against us... No more will we indirectly help fill up the [Kremlin's] war chests,"" European Commissioner for Energy Dan Jorgensen said in a news conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday.
In response to the plans, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday that Europe was ""shooting itself in the foot"".
The EU vowed to end its energy relations with Russia after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
A set of legislative proposals will be tabled in June asking all EU member states to make ""national plans"" to phase out Russian gas, nuclear fuel and oil imports, according to the European Commission.
The plans would stop Russia's ability to ""weaponise energy against us"", European Energy Minister Dan Jorgensen said
EU member states must submit strategies under the plans for replacing Russian oil imports by the end of 2027.
Countries have also been asked to outline strategies for ending their reliance on Russia for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials.
The EU hopes to move away from Russian gas by ""enhancing energy efficiency, accelerating the deployment of renewable energy and diversifying supplies"", the European Commission said.
While EU dependence on Russian oil, gas and nuclear fuels has decreased significantly since Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the bloc still imports a significant quantity of its energy from Russia.
According to the report, EU gas imports from Russia have decreased from 45% in 2021 to 19% in 2024.
The share of Russian oil imports has also shrunk from 27% at the beginning of 2022 to 3% now.
Work must be done to reduce the bloc's reliance on Russian nuclear supplies, products and services, the report said, with more than 14% of uranium in the EU sourced from Russia in 2024.
The EU's reliance on Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel poses ""risks to our economic security"" and financially supports Russia's war economy, the report said.
""We've come far, but not far enough,"" Jorgensen added in Tuesday's news conference, adding that measures to phase out Russian energy would be ""stepwise and gradual"" to minimise the impact on the EU. 
The roadmap also includes plans to target Russia's use of ""shadow fleets"" â oil tankers ""with obscure ownership and insurance"" that Russia uses to maintain its oil exports and bypass sanctions."

The US Supreme Court temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to enforce his ban on transgender people  serving in the military while legal challenges to the policy move forward. 
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed a pair of executive orders that enabled the Pentagon to implement the ban.
But a lower federal court blocked the policy in March, ruling that the administration had failed to provide evidence that transgender troops posed a threat to military effectiveness.
In an emergency application to the court, the Trump administration argued that the lower court should show deference to the military's  judgement in matters of national defence.
The court's three liberal justices objected to the stay, which arrived via an unsigned order on Tuesday.
Trump's executive order declared that identifying as transgender ""conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honourable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle"" and would hamper military preparedness.
In February, the Department of Defense announced it would begin discharging currently serving transgender personnel. 
Seven servicemembers, including Commander Emily Schilling, a Navy fighter pilot, swiftly challenged the ban, along with a transgender individual seeking to enlist.
The plaintiffs argued that the ban ""undermines military readiness, endangers our safety, and violates the United States Constitution"".""
""Today's Supreme Court ruling is a devastating blow to transgender servicemembers who have demonstrated their capabilities and commitment to our nation's defense,"" Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which are representing the plaintiffs, said in a joint statement.
""By allowing this discriminatory ban to take effect while our challenge continues, the Court has temporarily sanctioned a policy that has nothing to do with military readiness and everything to do with prejudice,"" it said.
In March, a federal judge in Washington state ordered a nationwide halt on the administration's ban, saying the government failed to show it would enhance ""unit cohesion, good order or discipline"".
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did not block the lower court's ruling, keeping the injunction in place.
With the Supreme Court order, that pause will lift while the servicemembers' lawsuit makes its way through lower courts.
White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt called the order ""another massive victory in the Supreme Court"".
Early in his second term, Trump took a series of actions that have significantly impacted transgender individuals, whose gender identity does not correspond to the sex assigned to them at birth. 
He signed an executive order declaring the US would only recognise two sexes - male and female.
The order has had far reaching implications for transgender Americans, especially those seeking to obtain official documentation.
The State Department announced in February that it would no longer allow applicants to choose ""X"" for their gender on their US passport, but instead must choose ""male"" or ""female"" based on their sex assigned at birth. 
The passport policy is the subject of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a group of transgender and nonbinary individuals. In mid-April, a federal judge issued an injunction on the passport policy while the case proceeds.
The administration has also pushed for policies to restrict certain kinds of healthcare for minors who identify as transgender, and to prevent transgender women from playing on women's sports teams."

Donald Trump said the US would stop attacking the Houthis in Yemen because the group had ""capitulated"", as Oman confirmed a ""ceasefire"" had been reached with the Iran-backed group for it to stop targeting shipping in the Red Sea.
""[The Houthis] just don't want to fight, and we will honour that and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,"" he said, speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the White House.  
Shortly afterwards the Omani foreign minister posted that the deal meant neither side would target the other, ""ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping"".
The Houthis have yet to comment.
The Houthis have ""capitulated"", Trump says
The US stepped up air strikes on the Houthis in March and the US military says it has struck 1,000 targets in Yemen since then. 
Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump said the Houthis would ""not be blowing up ships anymore"".
""The Houthis have announced that they are not, or they announced to us at least, that they don't want to fight anymore... but, more importantly, we will take their word. 
""They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore and that's what the purpose of what we were doing... so that's just news we just found out about that.""
Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi said his country had mediated efforts to achieve de-escalation.
""In the future, neither side will target the other, including American vessels, in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping"" he said.
The Houthis began attacking shipping passing through the Red Sea in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, who have been under bombardment by the Israeli military since the Palestinian armed group Hamas attacked Israeli communities in October 2023.
They have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks on commercial ships, sinking two vessels, seizing a third and killing four crew members. The attacks forced even major shipping companies to stop using the Red Sea - through which almost 15% of global seaborne trade usually passes - and to take a much longer route around southern Africa instead.
US-led naval forces thwarted many Houthi attacks on shipping and former US president Joe Biden began US air strikes against the Houthis, which have intensified under Trump.
Last month, the Houthis said at least 68 African migrants were killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in north-western Yemen.
The Houthis have continued firing missiles towards Israel, with one missile landing near Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday.
On Tuesday Israel responded with a large-scale attack on Yemen's main international airport in the capital Sanaa, which left it ""completely destroyed"" according to an airport official quoted by AFP.
Other Israeli strikes hit power facilities and a cement factory. On Monday Israel bombed port facilities in Hudaydah and another cement factory in the city."

The Israeli military has said it ""fully disabled"" Yemen's main airport in the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.
Tuesday's strikes targeted three civilian planes, the departures hall, the runway and a military air base, airport sources told Reuters. An official told AFP that the airport had been ""completely destroyed"".
The Houthis said at least three people had been killed and vowed to respond.
It comes two days after the Iran-backed Houthis fired a missile that landed near Israel's main airport, forcing it to close briefly.
Israel began responding on Monday by striking the Yemeni port city of Hudaydah, then targeted Sanaa airport the next day. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that anyone targeting Israel would be held ""accountable"".
In a video statement, Netanyahu said whoever attacks Israel ""bears responsibility for his own blood"".
""Our choice of when to respond, how to respond and on which targets to respond is a consideration that we make every time,"" he added.
Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the Houthis' top political body, meanwhile told Houthi-linked TV that Israel's attacks were ""failed terrorism"".
""Support for Gaza continues, the response is coming, and Netanyahu must prepare his resignation,"" he said.
The airport official said the three destroyed planes belonged to Yemenia Airlines. 
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had attacked runways, aircraft and ""infrastructure"" at Sanaa airport. It alleged the Houthis were using the airport to ""transfer weapons and operatives"".
Israel's military said it also struck power stations in Sanaa, which it described as ""significant electricity supply infrastructure"" for the Houthis - as well as the al-Imran cement factory in the north of the city. 
Meanwhile on Tuesday President Donald Trump said the US would stop attacking the Houthis after the group ""capitulated"".
""[The Houthis] just don't want to fight, and we will honour that and we will stop the bombings, and they have capitulated,"" he said, speaking alongside Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the White House.
Shortly afterwards the Omani foreign minister posted that the US and the Houthis had agreed a ceasefire deal under which neither side would attack the other ""ensuring freedom of navigation and the smooth flow of international commercial shipping"".
Israel hit multiple sites in the Yemeni capital on Tuesday
The Israeli strikes on Tuesday followed its attack a day earlier on Hudaydah. The port is the second-largest in the Red Sea after Aden, and is the entry point for about 80% of Yemen's food imports.
At least four people were killed and 35 others were wounded during Monday's attack, the Houthis said.
The group blamed the US and Israel jointly for the attack, but a US defence official told the AFP news agency that their forces did not participate.
The Houthi missile fired towards Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv, on Sunday landed next to an access road near the main terminal. Six people were injured, Israeli emergency services said.
Following the strike, the Houthis said they would impose ""a comprehensive aerial blockade"" on Israel by targeting airports in response to Israel's plans to expand its military operations in Gaza.
Israel has launched several previous rounds of strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, including targeting a power plant and ports in January. It previously attacked Sanaa airport in December."

Liverpool fans who were wrongly blamed for chaotic scenes before the 2022 Champions League Final in Paris have said an apology by France's former interior minister was ""not meaningful"".
Supporters were penned in and sprayed with tear gas by police as they tried to enter at the Stade de France before the final on 28 May against Real Madrid.
On Monday, GÃ©rald Darmanin said security arrangements for the game were wrong, and admitted previous remarks where he blamed Liverpool fans for the disorder ""were a mistake"".
But Labour MP for Liverpool West Derby Ian Byrne, who was in a crush that developed outside the stadium, said Darmanin's initial comments ""were absolutely disgraceful"".
Byrne said: ""He was fed a load of lies from the police and the services at the stadium and he swallowed that whole without listening to the other side and actually looking the night's events.
""I think it was unforgiveable what he did.""
Police used pepper spray and tear gas on fans outside the stadium
French authorities, including Darmanin, had initially said the dangerous crush at the stadium was largely caused by Liverpool fans who had fake tickets.
An independent report commissioned by UEFA found there was no evidence of the ""reprehensible claims"" and found the European football body bore primary responsibility for the chaos. 
In an interview on the Legend YouTube channel, Darmanin, now France's justice minister, said he had been ""led astray by my preconceptions""
He said Liverpool fans were ""quite right to be hurt"" and said much of the disorder had been caused by some local people ambushing and robbing fans as they tried to get into the stadium. 
Vic Huglin, who has followed the club for over 70 years and went to the final, said he was ""surprised"" the apology had taken so long. 
""This could have seriously been a matter of life and death,"" he said. 
""It could have been another Hillsborough.""
Mr Huglin said 10 members of his family who had travelled to Paris for the game, including his young grandson, did not go inside the stadium because they were ""petrified"". 
He said fans were refunded for their tickets, but should have been further compensated for travel expenses and emotional distress. 
He said: ""Anybody can say sorry, but my son [who didn't go inside] incurred huge amounts of expenses and all he got was the compensation for the ticket.""
Byrne said the French politician's apology was ""not meaningful"". 
""His mealy-mouthed half apology will be noted by Liverpool fans, but I don't think there'll be any congratulations,"" he added.

It sounds like it could be the plot of a spy novel, but the ""Shetland Bus"" was a real undercover operation carried out to help the resistance in Nazi-occupied Norway during World War Two. 
In the depths of winter and under the cover of darkness, convoys of small fishing boats left the safety of Scotland's most northerly islands to deliver valuable cargo and special agents to coves and fishing ports 200 miles away along the coast of Norway.
On the perilous return journeys, refugees fleeing the occupation were hidden in the hold of the fishing boats, as they sought sanctuary in the British Isles.
To commemorate the 80th Anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day, six of the historic ships that formed part of the Shetland Bus convoys set sail again from Bergen in Norway, replicating the journey back to Shetland.
The Liberation Convoy, external arrived in Lerwick on Tuesday in time for the VE Day commemorations, and will also visit Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
The M/K Erkna transported 60 refugees from Norway in a single trip in 1941
Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940, a few months before the full occupation of France.
The Norwegian government and its Royal Family, including King Haakon VII, were forced into exile in London and thousands of Norwegian people followed in fishing boats and other small vessels, crossing the North Sea to seek refuge in the UK.
In July 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill set up a clandestine organisation called the Special Operations Executive (SOE) with the sole aim of carrying out espionage and sabotage missions across German-occupied Europe.
The Shetland Bus convoys were part of the Norwegian branch of the SOE, supporting the resistance movement in Norway.
Between 1940 and 1945, they made 200 North Sea crossings, transporting hundreds of resistance agents, tonnes of weapons and supplies, and rescuing more than 300 Norwegian refugees fleeing the occupation.
The M/K Heland carried 23 refugees from Vigra to Shetland on 25 February 1942
The 200-mile crossings took place in winter to make the most of the hours of darkness and avoid being spotted by German patrols.
But this meant that the sea was often treacherous.
The crews and passengers on board had to endure not only heavy North Sea conditions, but also the constant risk of discovery by German aircraft or patrol boats.
The MK Arnefjord made it safely across to the island of Mousa in Shetland and delivered crews and passengers 
On 27 September 1941, the MK Arnefjord left the small island of Hernar, to the north-west of Bergen, carrying 20 refugees.
Although the weather started off calm, they soon encountered a raging storm. Everyone onboard was seasick and some discussed turning back.
Eventually the Arnefjord made it safely across and delivered crews and passengers to the island of Mousa in Shetland.
But others were not so lucky. Of the six boats that crossed the North Sea with the Arnefjord that weekend, only four made it.
In total, 10 fishing boats were lost during the Shetland Bus convoys and 44 men lost their lives.
Morten Neset is the current skipper of the M/K Arnefjord and will be making the journey to Shetland as part of the Liberation Convoy
The current skipper of the MK Arnefjord, Morten Neset, is making the return journey back to Shetland as part of the VE Day commemorations.
He told BBC Scotland News that the boats had to make the crossings in the winter or late autumn to avoid being detected by the Germans. 
""If they crossed on a clear summer day, they would be spotted straight away,"" he said. 
""The Shetland Bus was really important for the general population of Norway as it showed that someone was 'standing up for them' in their resistance against the occupation.""
The M/K Andholmen was used to land allied soldiers during the battle for Narvik in May 1940
A memorial in Scalloway remembers the 44 men who lost their lives
Bill Moore, from the Shetland Bus Friendship Society, said that, although it was difficult to say what impact it had on the war, it was an important part of the resistance movement which gave optimism and hope to the people in Norway. 
People said they were ""taking the Shetland Bus"" as a code for escaping the occupation.
Shetland residents hosted soldiers and refugees from Norway throughout the war, forming a close bond between the two locations that endures to this day."

In a statement, external, the African Union warned that the attack on Port Sudan represented ""a dangerous escalation"" in the Sudanese civil war and ""a direct threat to the lives of civilians, humanitarian access and regional stability"".
Prior to the attacks on Sunday, Port Sudan had avoided bombardment and was regarded as one of the safest places in the war-ravaged nation.
The paramilitary group has increasingly relied on drones to reclaim its lost territories, including Khartoum which was taken back by the army in March.
The two years of fighting between the army and the RSF has killed thousands, forced millions from their homes and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Both the army and RSF have been accused of war crimes.

Three people are dead and at least seven more are missing after a small boat overturned off the coast near San Diego, California, officials said.
At least 16 people, including two children,  were on board the panga-style fishing boat, the US Coast Guard said. Initially, as many as nine people were reported missing - but two were later found and detained. 
An official told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that the incident was being treated as a suspected case of human smuggling. A number of Indian passports were found near where the boat washed up on a beach, news agency Reuters reported.
Four of those found have been taken to hospital. It is not known if anyone else entered the water.
The coast guard said on Tuesday that seven people from the boat remained missing, but that it had suspended its search ""pending further developments"".
Search and rescue efforts by air and sea had continued for nearly 28 hours, covering more than 520 sq nautical miles, the agency said.
It was unclear where the boat was coming from before it flipped about 35 miles (56km) north of the Mexico border, Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey told the Associated Press news agency. 
He said similar vessels were commonly used by smugglers. ""They were not tourists,"" Mr Sappey said. ""They are believed to be migrants.""
A panga boat is a small, open lightweight vessel typically powered by an outboard motor. 
A coastguard cutter and a helicopter were searching for the missing, a spokesman told the BBC. 
Nick Backouris, a lieutenant with the San Diego Sheriff's office, said people from his office helped victims on the beach.

Conservative leader Friedrich Merz has won a parliament vote to become Germany's next chancellor at the second attempt.
Merz had initially fallen six votes short of the absolute majority he needed on Tuesday morning - a significant blow to his prestige and an unprecedented failure in post-war German history.
As it was a secret ballot in the 630-seat Bundestag, there was no indication who had refused to back him - whether MPs from his centre-left coalition partner or his own conservatives.
After hours of uncertainty in the Bundestag, the parties and the president of the Bundestag agreed to hold a second vote, which Merz then won with 325 votes, a majority of nine.
His coalition with the Social Democrats should have had enough seats in parliament from the start, with 328 MPs in total, but it is thought 18 of them dissented during the first vote.
No chancellor candidate has lost a Bundestag vote in the 76 years since democracy was restored in Germany in 1949, and there was a prevailing mood of confusion in parliament in the hours after the vote.
Under Germany's constitution, there is no limit to how many votes can be held but in practice another defeat for Merz would have meant a headache for his Christian Democrats, its sister party the Christian Social Union and their partner the Social Democrats.
The result meant a total debacle had been averted, declared one German news website.
Merz, 69, was then sworn in as chancellor by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and his team of 17 ministers were due to take office.
Bundestag President Julia KlÃ¶ckner had originally been planning a follow-up vote on Wednesday, but Christian Democrat General Secretary Carsten Linnemann said it was important to press ahead.
""Europe needs a strong Germany, that's why we can't wait for days,"" he told German TV. 
Parliamentary group leader Jens Spahn appealed to his colleagues' sense of responsibility: ""All of Europe, perhaps the whole world, is watching this ballot.""
Merz's defeat had been seen by political commentators as a humiliation, possibly inflicted by a handful of disaffected members of the Social Democrat SPD, which signed a coalition deal with his conservatives on Monday.
The Bundestag president told MPs that nine of the 630 MPs had been absent for the first vote while three had abstained and another ballot paper had been declared invalid.
Germany's new Europe Minister, Gunther Krichbaum, told the BBC that some MPs may have hoped for a ministerial or state secretary role and had their hopes dashed. He also pointed out that some young Social Democrats had publicly said they were not convinced by Merz.
Conservative colleague Johann Wadephul: ""I'm sure [Merz] will be the next chancellor""
However, SPD officials were adamant their party was fully committed to the coalition deal.
""It was a secret vote so nobody knows,"" senior Social Democrat MP Ralf Stegner told the BBC, ""but I can tell you I don't have the slightest impression that our parliamentary group wouldn't have known our responsibility.""
Krichbaum, a conservative, said the clear message was that ""now we are today in the situation to create a stable government"" to tackle Germany's big issues, including migration and the economy.
Far-right party Alternative for Germany, which came second in the February election with 20.8% of the vote, seized on Merz's initial failure and called for fresh elections.
Joint leader Alice Weidel wrote on X that the vote showed ""the weak foundation on which the small coalition has been built between the [conservatives] and SPD, which was rejected by voters"".
Merz's choice for foreign minister, Christian Democrat colleague Johann Wadephul, told the BBC the initial vote was ""an obstacle but not a catastrophe"".
Germany's handover of government is carefully choreographed. On the eve of Tuesday's vote, outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz was treated to a traditional Grand Tattoo by an armed forces orchestra.
Merz had then been expected to sail through the initial vote on Tuesday morning, fulfilling a long-held ambition to become German chancellor.
His rival and former chancellor Angela Merkel had come to the Bundestag to watch the vote take place. She was not present for the second vote.
Former chancellor Angela Merkel had come to the Bundestag to see the vote
Among the first international leaders to congratulate Germany's conservative leader was Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky, who hoped that Germany would ""grow even stronger and that we'll see more German leadership in European and transatlantic affairs"".
Political correspondents in the Bundestag said Merz's initial shock result indicated he had a potential problem lurking within his coalition ranks.
AfD MP Bernd Baumann said the CDU had promised a string of policies similar to his own party's, such as limiting migration, and had then gone into an alliance with the centre left: ""That doesn't work. That's not how democracy works.""
""This isn't good,"" warned Green politician Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt. ""Even though I don't want this chancellor or support him, I can only warn everyone not to rejoice in chaos.""
Barely 24 hours earlier, the messaging from Merz had been very different, of a new, stable government bringing six months of political paralysis to an end.
""It's our historical duty to make this government a success,"" he had said as he signed the coalition document on Monday.
Despite having a narrow majority of 12 seats, the agreement between the conservatives and centre left was seen as far more secure than the so-called traffic-light coalition of three parties that fell apart last November in a row over debt spending.
The SPD, which had been the biggest party in the old coalition slumped to its worst post-war election result in third place, but Merz had promised that Germany was back and that he would boost its voice on the world stage and revive a flagging economy.
After two years of recession, Europe's largest economy grew in the first three months of 2025. However economists have warned of potential risks to German exports because of US-imposed tariffs.
Germany's services sector contracted last month because of weaker demand and lower consumer spending."

The Catholic Church in Kenya has responded to concerns that the country's only  cardinal will not be participating in the election of the next pope because he had not been asked to attend.
Following Pope Francis' death last month, senior Catholic leaders, known as cardinals, who are younger than 80, are eligible to elect his successor. 
They are due to begin meeting in the Vatican on Wednesday, but Kenyan Cardinal John Njue, 79, was quoted in a Kenyan newspaper saying that he had not been invited and he did not know why.
Catholic officials in Kenya later said that he had been invited but was not able to go because of ill health.
Who will be the next Pope?
How a Pope is elected
Why the conclave is so unpredictable
""Although [the cardinal] is eligible to participate and was officially invited... owing to his current health condition [he] will be unable to travel to Rome,"" a statement signed by Archbishop Philip Anyolo said.
""Let us also continue to pray for the good health of His Eminence John Cardinal Njue.""
The archbishop did not explain the health issues further.
Tuesday's statement by the Nairobi archdiocese noted that it was reacting to concerns over Cardinal Njue's participation and ""various enquiries"" about whether he would be at the cardinals' meeting, known as a conclave.
The Daily Nation newspaper had quoted him as saying that he had not been invited adding that ""it is not because of health... I don't know really... it's difficult to comment about it"".
Cardinal Njue was the Archbishop of Nairobi from 2007 until his retirement in 2021.
He was appointed a cardinal in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI becoming the second cardinal to have come from the country.
He and Spain's Cardinal Antonio CaÃ±izares, 79, are the only cardinals who will not be participating in the papal vote out the 135 who are eligible.
A two-thirds majority, or at least 89 of them, are required to elect the new pontiff and successor of Pope Francis to lead the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.

A student at Temple University has been suspended after an antisemitic incident at a sports bar in the city of Philadelphia went viral.
Police are investigating after a three-word sign with an expletive about Jews was held up at the pub on Saturday.
Dave Portnoy, the owner of the Barstool Sansom Street bar, said two employees had been fired. Two others had agreed to go to Auschwitz, the former Nazi Germany death camp, for ""a learning experience"", he added.
The incident comes amid growing scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration of how antisemitism allegations are handled on US college campuses.
The incident began after two customers ordered the illuminated sign along with drinks at the bar, Mr Portnoy said in a video on X.
The founder of digital media company Barstool Sports expressed outrage and vowed to take swift action.
In a second video a few hours later, he said he had spoken with the culprits and their families.
Explaining the Holocaust to young people
Mr Portnoy, who is Jewish, said the pair had agreed to go to Auschwitz, in Poland, which he believed to be ""a fair outcome"".
He later retracted his offer for at least one of those involved because he said the person denied responsibility for what happened.
Mr Portnoy wrote on social media that the customer ""did a 180"" and refused to admit any wrongdoing. 
""His trip to Poland has been revoked,"" Mr Portnoy said in the post. ""Whatever ramifications come his way he 100% earned.""
His initial effort to extend an olive branch came after seeing a sharp rise in antisemitism recently, amid his 20 years of running Barstool, he said.
""I've had more hate, more antisemitism in the last year, year-and-a-half, than I've ever had doing it,"" Mr Portnoy said.
The bar, which was closed on Sunday, posted a statement on Instagram saying it was ""saddened, embarrassed and frustrated"" by the incident.
""Unfortunately, several employees ignored all of their training and the organization's written policies regarding our zero tolerance policy for discrimination and hate,"" the statement continued.
Temple University President John Fry addressed the incident on Sunday, saying in a letter to the campus that ""Temple students were involved in an antisemitic incident at an off-campus location"" on Saturday.
He said one student suspected of  involvement had been placed on interim suspension.
""Any additional students who are found to be involved will face strict disciplinary action under the Student Conduct Code, up to and including expulsion"", he added."

Russia says Ukraine launched a drone attack on Moscow - days before the start of a ceasefire, ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to coincide with a World War Two parade.
Moscow's four major airports shut for a few hours on Tuesday amid the barrage, authorities said. There were no casualties and Ukraine has not commented.
Moscow is due to hold a parade on 9 May to mark the victory of the Soviet Union and allies over Nazi Germany. This year is the 80th anniversary of the end of WW2 and will see world leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, in Russia for the event.
Putin has called for a three-day ceasefire from 8 May - something Ukraine has not committed to. Kyiv wants a longer truce.
""Fire will be halted, but should the Kyiv regime fail to do the same and should it continue trying to strike our positions and facilities, then an appropriate response will be given immediately,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. 
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed Russia's ceasefire plans as a ""theatrical play"". Instead, he has been pushing for a ceasefire of at least 30 days where there would be a halt to missile and drone strikes on civilian targets.
He has also reportedly said his country cannot guarantee the safety of anyone travelling to Moscow this week.
""Our position is very simple for all countries traveling to Russia on May 9: We cannot be held responsible for what happens on the territory of the Russian Federation,"" Zelensky was quoted as saying over the weekend by Ukrainian news agency Interfax.
Ukraine's foreign ministry went a step further, calling on ""all foreign states to refrain from the participation of their military personnel in the parade in Moscow"".
In a statement on Tuesday, it said taking part in the event would be ""regarded by Ukraine as an insult to the memory of the victory over Nazism [and] the memory of millions of Ukrainian front-line soldiers who liberated our country and all of Europe from Nazism eight decades ago"".
The Kremlin had previously announced a 30-hour truce with Ukraine over Easter, where both sides reported a decrease in fighting, but accused each other of hundreds of violations.
Russian authorities said the Ukraine attack was the second in as many nights.
Moscow's mayor said at least 19 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted ""from different directions"". Sergei Sobyanin added that debris had landed on one of Moscow's key highways. 
The governors of other Russian cities, including Penza and Voronezh, also said they had been targeted. 
Meanwhile, Ukraine reported downing 54 drones launched overnight from Russia, and several strikes across the country - including in Kyiv.
Four people have died as a result of the most recent attacks - three in the Sumy region, close to the Russian border, and one in the Black Sea city of Odesa. 
Kharkiv's regional head, Oleh Syniehubov, said 11 people had been injured and the city's central market had been destroyed in a fire. At least four others were injured in the southern city of Nikopol on Tuesday morning, the regional head reported. 
Fighting also continues in Russia's Kursk region more than a week after Moscow said it had pushed Ukrainian troops out. Ukraine had denied that report and said its forces were still active there.
A total of 200 combat engagements occurred between Ukrainian and Russian troops on Monday, Ukrainian military authorities said.
Ukraine pushed into the Russian border region in a surprise incursion last August, but has since gained little ground."

The US government is offering migrants who are in the country illegally a sum worth $1,000 (Â£751) and paid travel if they decide to leave the US.
""Self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in Monday's announcement.
Those who take up the offer could one day be offered a legal pathway to return to the US, Trump told reporters the same day.
Since returning to office in January, the president has launched a major crackdown on illegal immigration - at times relying on controversial tactics such as the invocation of a centuries-old wartime law. Some moves have faced legal challenges.
Those who signed up for the ""self-deportation"" financial incentive would not be prioritised for detention by immigration officials, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a news release.
The DHS said a first ""illegal alien"" had already taken up the offer, receiving a ticket for a flight from Chicago to Honduras.
The scheme relies on migrants utilising the CBP Home app, which can be used to confirm that person's return to their home country, officials explained in their release.
They described the offer as a ""dignified"" route, adding that it would cut the cost of deportations for the DHS. The average cost to arrest, detain, and deport a migrant currently stood at more than $17,000, they said.
Trump himself said the question of whether any given migrant would one day be offered a legal route back to the US was one of national interest.
""We're going to work with them so that maybe someday, with a little work, they can come back in if they're good people, if they're the kind of people that we want in our [country],"" he told reporters.
The plan has also faced criticism. Adriano Espaillat, a Dominican-American congressman for the Democratic Party, wrote on X: ""We don't bribe people to leave. We build a country where everyone belongs.""
The president and his allies have touted their track record on immigration after three months in office, highlighting the fact that illegal crossings have dropped. 
Border Patrol data showed a record low of just over 7,000 arrests at the US-Mexico border during the month of March. 
Trump has also used an increase in detentions inside the country by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to argue that his plan is working.
On the other hand, the administration has so far not managed to deport as many migrants as promised, and courts have blocked Trump's attempts to end birthright citizenship for certain children.

Could Trump invoke another rarely-used law at the border?

The Peruvian government has imposed a night-time curfew in Pataz province, where  13 kidnapped mine workers were killed last week.
President Dina Boluarte also ordered that mining activities be suspended for a month while extra police and soldiers are deployed to the region.
The incident has shone a spotlight on the activities of criminal gangs in Pataz.
La Poderosa, the Peruvian company which owns the gold mine at which the men worked, said they had been kidnapped by ""illegal miners colluding with criminals"" on 26 April. Their bodies were found on Sunday.
President Boluarte said that the armed forces would take ""full control of La Poderosa mining area"".
La Poderosa said in a statement that in total, 39 people with links to the company had been killed by criminal gangs in Pataz, a mining region more than 800km (500 miles) north of the capital, Lima. 
It added that the state of emergency which has been in effect in the province since February 2024 had had little effect. 
""The spiral of uncontrolled violence in Pataz is occurring despite the declaration of a state of emergency and the presence of a large police contingent which, unfortunately, has not been able to halt the deterioration of security conditions in the area,"" said the statement from 2 May.
The 13 men whose bodies were found on Sunday were employed by a subcontractor, R&R, which worked at La Poderosa's mine. 
They had been sent to confront a group which had attacked and occupied the mine but were ambushed and seized as they were trying to regain control of it. 
Videos shared by their captors showed them tied up and naked, lying in a mine shaft. 
The footage, and the fact that their captors shared it with the relatives in an attempt to get them to pay ransom money, caused outrage in Peru. 
The discovery of their bodies on Sunday and forensic evidence suggesting they were shot point blank more than a week before they were found, has caused further shock.
A prosecutor from the region, Luis Guillermo Bringas, told local media that the area was being rocked by ""a war for mining pits"" between illegal miners and criminals on the one hand and legal miners on the other."

Two weeks ago, the photograph of a woman sitting motionless beside her husband's body went viral across Indian social media.
It captured a moment of unspeakable grief - one that came to symbolise the 22 April militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in which 26 civilians were killed.
The woman in the photo was Himanshi Narwal, whose husband, a 26-year-old naval officer, was among the victims. The couple, who had been married for less than a week, were on their honeymoon when Vinay Narwal was shot dead.
But within days, Ms Narwal, who had been portrayed as the face of the tragedy, found herself at the centre of a hate campaign.
It started last week when she urged people not to target Muslims or Kashmiris as emotions ran high across the country. 
Survivors of the attack have said that Hindu men were targeted, and that the victims were shot after the militants checked their religion. Indian security forces are still searching for the attackers.
Since the attack, there have been reports of Kashmiri vendors and students in other Indian cities facing harassment and threats, mainly from members of Hindu right-wing groups.
'We are too scared to go back': Kashmiris in India face violence after deadly attack
""People going against Muslims or Kashmiris - we don't want this. We want peace and only peace,"" Ms Narwal told reporters, external at a blood donation camp held by the family on what would have been her husband's 27th birthday. ""Of course, we want justice. The people who have wronged him should be punished,"" she added.
It was her first public statement since a video of her bidding an emotional farewell over her husband's coffin went viral. In it, the grief-stricken widow says with tears: ""It is because of him that the world is still surviving. And we should all be proud of him in every way.""
Her appeal for peace sparked a swift backlash. Within hours, many of the internet users who had earlier mourned her loss were posting abusive comments.
Vinay Narwal was on his honeymoon with Himanshi when he was shot dead
Some accused her of dishonouring her husband's memory as she refused to blame ordinary Kashmiris for the attack. Others made and shared unfounded claims about her friendships and relationships with Kashmiri men while studying at a university in Delhi. Yet more claimed that she had no right to speak about her husband's death as they were only married for a few days.
As the online abuse continued, India's National Commission for Women, external (NCW) wrote on X, external that the trolling was ""extremely reprehensible and unfortunate"".
""Perhaps her reaction may not have gone down well with angry people. But any kind of agreement or disagreement should always be expressed with decency and within constitutional limits,"" NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar, external wrote on X.
Journalist Namita Bhandare, who covers gender issues, told the BBC that it was ""shocking"" how much hatred Ms Narwal received for simply appealing for peace and calm.
She was viciously trolled because she ""appealed for peace rather than succumbing to the narrative of revenge"", Ms Bhandare added.
Ms Narwal was not the only survivor of the attack to face online abuse.
Arathi R Menon, the daughter of a man from Kerala state who was killed in the shootings, was also trolled after she recounted her ordeal in front of the media.
Some people said that she spoke too calmly and didn't display much emotion as she recounted her father's death. Others found fault with her praising two Kashmiri men who she said helped her and took care of her ""like a sister"".
""It is the same old story - women are always the easy targets,"" says Ms Bhandare, adding that female victims of online abuse are also likely to be sexualised and threatened with violence.
""Being faceless online gives people the courage to say whatever they want,"" she says. ""And of course, there's patriarchy at play, women are singled out, no matter who they are.""
Twenty-six people were gunned down by militants in Pahalgam last month
Amid the abuse, Ms Narwal received support online as well.
""Your [Ms Narwal's] statement in the face of that loss was an act of grace and unimaginable strength,"" writer and activist Gurmehar Kaur wrote on X, external.
""My mother was your age when she lost my father in the [Kashmir] valley. I know this kind of loss."" 
In 2017, Kaur, then a graduate student, became the target of a vicious social media campaign after she spoke against a Hindu right-wing student group after a clash at a college in Delhi. Many of the people who trolled her took issue with an earlier campaign by her where she said her father, a soldier who died in 1999, was killed by war, not Pakistan.
Journalist Rohini Singh welcomed the NCW's statement supporting Ms Narwal, but asked why no action had been taken against the social media accounts ""blatantly abusing and slandering her"".
Members of India's opposition parties have also urged the government to act.
Priyanka Chaturvedi, an MP from the Shiv Sena (UBT) party, tagged federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in a post, external, asking him to ""stand with the widow of an Indian officer"" and take action against the trolling.
No Indian minister has commented on the trolling campaign yet, and no police complaint has been lodged.
Meanwhile, Ms Bhandare says that, like many online hate campaigns, this too may follow a familiar pattern: ""It will run its course and then the people will move on to their next target.""

The Indian government has threatened to take legal action against Sotheby's in Hong Kong unless they stop an upcoming auction of jewels linked to the Buddha's remains and requested their return to India. 
The auction, which is set to take place on Wednesday, includes gems which were found buried with Buddha's bone fragments more than a hundred years ago.  
India's ministry of culture has said the sale ""violates Indian and international laws as well as UN conventions"", and asked for the jewels should be treated as sacred. The sale has also been condemned by several Buddhists and art scholars globally.
Sotheby's has told the BBC the auction will proceed as planned. 
The Indian ministry posted a letter it sent to Sotheby's and Chris PeppÃ©, the great-grandson of William Claxton PeppÃ©, who excavated the relics in 1898, on Instagram, external. 
The post stated that Sotheby's has responded to the legal notice and assured that the matter is receiving its ""full attention"".
The post said that PeppÃ© ""lacks authority"" to sell the relics and accused the auction house of participating in ""continued colonial exploitation"" by facilitating the sale. 
Jewels linked to Buddha remains go to auction, sparking ethical debate 
William Claxton PeppÃ© was an English estate manager who excavated a stupa at Piprahwa, just south of Lumbini, the believed birthplace of Buddha. He uncovered relics inscribed and consecrated nearly 2,000 years ago. 
The findings included nearly 1,800 gems, including rubies, topaz, sapphires and patterned gold sheets, stored inside a brick chamber. This site is now in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
The jewels were unearthed from this stupa in Piprahwa, which is now part of Uttar Pradesh state
William PeppÃ© handed the gems, relics and reliquaries to the colonial Indian government, from where the bone relics went to the Buddhist King of Siam (Rama V). Five relic urns, a stone chest and most other relics were sent to the Indian Museum in Kolkata - then the Imperial Museum of Calcutta.
Only a small ""portion of duplicates"", which he was allowed to keep, remained in the PeppÃ© family, Chris PeppÃ© said. (Sotheby's notes say PeppÃ© was allowed to keep approximately one-fifth of the discovery.)
The Indian ministry has said that labelling the jewels as ""duplicates"" is misleading and that these relics make up the ""inalienable religious and cultural heritage"" of India. 
The jewels ""cannot be treated as specimens"" but as the ""sacred body and originally interred offerings to the sacred body"" of the Buddha, the post said. 
The ministry has also questioned the custodianship of the jewels. 
It said that the sellers who call themselves the custodians of the gems do not have the right to ""alienate or misappropriate the asset"", which it calls an ""extraordinary heritage of humanity"". 
The statement also mentioned a decade-old report which said that the relics were left forgotten in a shoebox, suggesting that custodianship should also include ""safe upkeep"". 
The Indian ministry has demanded a public apology from Sotheby's and PeppÃ©. It has also asked them to fully disclose all records that trace the ownership of the relics that are still in their possession or transferred by them. 
The ministry has said that the failure to comply with their demands would lead to legal proceedings in India and Hong Kong for ""violation of cultural heritage law"". 
It also threatened to launch a ""public campaign"" highlighting Sotheby's role in perpetuating ""colonial injustice"". 
Earlier, Chris PeppÃ© had told the BBC that the the family looked into donating the relics, but all options presented problems and an auction seemed the ""fairest and most transparent way to transfer these relics to Buddhists"".
Chris PeppÃ© has written that the jewels passed from his great-uncle to his cousin, and in 2013 came to him and two other cousins.
Over the past six years years, the gems have featured in major exhibitions, including one at The Met in 2023. The PeppÃ© family has also launched a website to ""share our research"".
But the Indian ministry in its statement said custodianship of the jewels has been ""monetised via publicity and exhibition"".

Here is a look at some of the highlights:
Actress Zendaya, known for her dazzling red carpet style, opted for a wide-brimmed hat and tailored Louis Vuitton cream suit at this year's Met Gala.
But there was one slight pop of colour: her manicured red nails.
Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny wore a brown Prada suit, which he said he worked on with the Italian fashion house for a few months before the event.
He also stayed on theme by accessorising with embellished gloves, a brooch and a hat that paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage. 
""We did something special,"" he said of his look. ""I feel good, and I hope people think I'm looking good.""
US reality TV star Kim Kardashian wore an all-black ensemble by LA-based brand Chrome Hearts - a fitted leather top and skirt that she offset with diamond necklaces and two strings of pearls.
She is, of course, no stranger to the Met Gala - having made headlines with a dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in 2022, and a wet-look Thierry Mugler dress in 2019.
Black British designer Grace Wales Bonner dressed British Formula One star Sir Lewis Hamilton for the night. Sir Lewis was a co-chair of this year's event.
The pair have worked together in the past with Wales Bonner dressing Hamilton for the 2023 British Fashion Awards.

The singer worked with Wicked costume designer Paul Tazewell on her outfit, while make-up artist Pat McGrath was behind her disco-inspired look.
Demi Moore gave us another round of method dressing. 
The American actress's recent press tour for The Substance recalled the body horror themes of the film, while her awards campaign for the role of Elisabeth Sparkle saw her dressing for the glam statuettes.
Moore understood the assignment for the Met Gala, coming as a literal men's tie in a sculptural black and white striped sequin gown from Thom Browne.
Rihanna, typically one of the most stylish attendees at the Gala, returned to the Met steps this year in Marc Jacobs, debuting her pregnancy with co-chair of the evening A$AP Rocky.
Legendary singer Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble, complete with feathers and a long train that required at least two assistants.

She added she had the names of her children and grandchildren embroidered on her dress train.
Actress Sydney Sweeney wore a custom Miu Miu gown - her third time wearing the designer at the Met Gala. This time, her dress was complete with beaded fringe shoulders and gold hardware detailing on the neck.
Speaking about her look, Sweeney said it paid homage to actress and painter Kim Novak. Sweeney is set to portray Novak in the upcoming film Scandalous.

Singer Coco Jones opted for a look designed by Indian brand Manish Malhotra.
She wore a tailored cream and white look that featured ornate embroidery and a dramatic long-sleeve coat. Jones also wore a large statement necklace and Jimmy Choo heels.
Actor and playwright Colman Domingo could have inspired this year's Met Gala theme, as he's been carrying the baton for well-dressed men on the red carpet for several years now. 
He donned a royal blue Valentino cloak that paid homage to Andre Leon Talley, former editor-at-large on Vogue whom Anna Wintour called ""a dandy among dandies.""
The cape later was removed to reveal a second look underneath: a tailored, patterned suit complete with a big fabric, polka-dotted flower brooch. 
Actress and singer Teyana Taylor, who hosted Vogue's live stream of the red carpet, arrived in custom Marc Jacobs on the arm of costume designer Ruth E. Carter.

Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has resigned and his Social Democrat party is to leave the government after a right-wing nationalist candidate won the first round of the presidential election.
George Simion, a eurosceptic who has promised to put Romania first, won 40.9% of Sunday's vote and is expected to win a run-off vote on 18 May.
He will face liberal Bucharest Mayor NicuÈor Dan, who narrowly defeated the Social Democrat (PSD) candidate. 
Sunday's result plunged Romania - an EU state on Nato's eastern flank - into further political turmoil. Ciolacu told colleagues that as their coalition had failed to meet its objective and ""has no legitimacy"", they should pull out of the government.
Ciolacu, 57, only came to power in a pro-EU coalition after elections in 2024, although George Simion's far-right party along with two other groupings had attracted a third of the vote.
The parties in that coalition had been holding emergency meetings on Monday to decide on their next steps.
Simion's victory on Sunday was largely driven by popular frustration at the annulment of presidential elections late last year. His likely success on 18 May is awaited nervously in European capitals, as well as in Kyiv. 
He has said he wants an EU of strong, sovereign nations and his party has opposed supply weapons to Ukraine.
Ciolacu submitted his resignation to interim president Ilie Bolojan on Monday evening. 
Bolojan appointed Ciolacu's liberal coalition partner Catalin Predoiu as caretaker prime minister on Tuesday to lead the government until a new cabinet could be formed.
Bolojan himself took on the role of interim president last February because of the scandal surrounding the annulment of the presidential vote.
""Romania faces up to 45 days of political instability following Marcel Ciolacu's resignation,"" warned Elena Calistru of independent Romanian monitoring group Funky Citizens. 
""This creates a dangerous power vacuum precisely when Romania needs steady leadership most.""
Ciolacu's party was part of a three-party coalition and the prime minister told his colleagues they had come together with the aim of having a joint presidential candidate and a parliamentary majority.
""One of these two objectives has failed,"" he explained. ""I've seen the vote from yesterday, and that tells us the current coalition no longer has legitimacy in this form.""
""In any case, the new president would have replaced me â that's what I've seen and heard from the media. A new coalition will form to govern.""
Meanwhile, the Social Democrat mayor of of Buzau, to the north-east of Bucharest, was highly critical of his party leaders: ""We've embarrassed ourselves, and that's partly because of poor decisions taken over time by the leadership.""
'I am a Romanian patriot', George Simion tells Nick Thorpe
George Simion, 38, has cast himself as an admirer of US President Donald Trump. He became presidential frontrunner earlier this year when far-right pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu was barred from running 
Georgescu had won last November's first round, which was annulled by the courts after allegations of Russian interference on social media and campaign fraud.
Simion cast his vote on Sunday alongside Georgescu, having told voters the election was ""about every Romanian who has been lied to, ignored, humiliated, and still has the strength to believe and defend our identity and rights"".
He has called for restoring Romania's old borders and has been banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine.
Political analyst Radu Albu-Comanescu told Romania public radio that Sunday's result was ""a radical manifestation of hostility towards the current political establishment"".
Simion did particularly well with Romania's diaspora voters, polling more than 73% in Spain and almost 65% in the UK among a broadly blue-collar electorate.
Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian.
""Russia is the biggest danger towards Romania, Poland and the Baltic states, the problem is this war is not going anywhere,"" he told the BBC.
Elena Calistru said Romania was witnessing a remarkable political reset as both Simion and NicuÈor Dan had positioned themselves as anti-establishment candidates with wildly different solutions.
""The outcome will reveal whether anti-establishment sentiment necessarily translates to anti-European positioning, or if Romania can channel its desire for change into constructive democratic renewal,"" she told the BBC."

A hose pipe ban has been introduced in Milford in County Donegal, Mullingar in County Westmeath, and Kells-Oldcastle in County Meath amid concerns over very low water levels.
The restrictions will apply from Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Uisce Ãireann (Irish Water) has said dry conditions stretching back to last autumn, through winter, and into spring have led to a sharp drop in water supply at key reservoirs, external.
Milford in County Donegal is supplied by Lough Colmcille. Both it and Lough Bane, which serves the Kells-Oldcastle area, are at historically low levels. 
Lough Owel, which supplies Mullingar, is now at its lowest level for 50 years.
Lough Owel in County Meath, which supplies Mullingar, is now at its lowest level for 50 years
The water conservation order bans the use of hose pipes for domestic and certain non-domestic uses, such as watering gardens outside businesses.
The organisation says this is aimed at preserving water for essential services.
""The past 12 months have been drier than normal when compared to the long-term average"" according to Margaret Attridge, head of water operations.
""This means that some water sources which traditionally would have replenished over the winter period have not seen the same level of recovery.""
""As a result, we are starting to experience issues with water availability at these sources,"" Ms Attridge said
Despite the targeted nature of the restrictions the utility has urged all households and businesses across Ireland to use water wisely as the country enters the summer months.
Earlier in 2025 Irish weather service, Met Ãireann, reported that rainfall was below average at most weather stations, external in the Republic during winter.
The organisation also reported that autumn in 2024 was the 17th driest since records began in 1940, external.
In Northern Ireland, NI Water has said reservoirs are at a healthy position for the time of year despite experiencing a winter and spring with less than average rainfall.
""Rain in mid-April helped bring reservoir levels back up to 93% capacity"" according to Water Supply Manager, Maynard Cousley.
""However, it is a timely reminder that our weather patterns are changing and we cannot take our water supply for granted.
""We must use our water supply wisely so we can conserve it for when we need it most.""
In a their April publication, the EU's Copernicus climate service has placed Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland into a drought warning status, moving from a drought watch status, external earlier in 2025.
This indicates low rainfall is now accompanied by declining soil-moisture levels and the first signs of vegetation stress, they said.

A partnership between York and the Ukrainian city of Lviv has moved a step closer, following calls to complete a process which first got under way three years ago.
In April 2022, two months after Russia invaded Ukraine, councillors in York approved the adoption of Lviv in western Ukraine as a ""sister city"".
But at a recent meeting, delays in implementing the link between the two cities was branded by opposition councillors as an ""embarrassing failure"".
However, it has since been confirmed that talks between City of York Council's Labour leader Claire Douglas and Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, were due to be held, though the date had yet to be decided.
The completion of the ""sisterhood"" process would see both cities work together on culture, education, business and other areas, according to the Sister Cities International organisation.
City of York Council leader Claire Douglas said the immediate focus was on demonstrating ""solidarity with Ukraine""
Ukrainian embassy officials were understood to have met Douglas, as well as Katie Lomas, City of York Council's Labour finance and human rights spokesperson, earlier in April.
Douglas said she now looked forward to speaking to Lviv's mayor about how the two cities could work closer in the future.
""Our immediate focus is on continuing to demonstrate our solidarity with Ukraine,"" she explained.
""This includes offering practical support for our Ukrainian guests here in York, extending our heartfelt thoughts and prayers for the people of Ukraine - both those here in York, who are so far from their loved ones, and those in Ukraine who are bravely coping with the most unimaginable hardships.""
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Lib Dem councillor Chris CullwickÂ had welcomed movement on the link between York and the Ukrainian city.
He said his party had ""been pushing for stronger ties with Lviv since the full-scale invasion began"", including tabling the original motion back in 2022 calling for a ""formal sisterhood"" between the two cities.
""We've repeatedly urged the administration to follow through, so it's good to see our efforts starting to bear fruit. We now want to see this momentum continue,"" Cullwick added.
Lviv has a population of just over 700,000 people and is situated about 70 miles (112km) away from the Polish border.
Its centre is a Unesco World Heritage Site and, like York, Lviv is designated a Unesco Creative City, recognised for its literary culture.
Since 2022, 416 Ukrainians have arrived and settled in York through the Homes for Ukraine scheme.

As 133 cardinals meet in Rome to decide the next pope, questions about the legacy of the last one will loom large over their discussions.
For the Catholic Church, no aspect of Pope Francis' record is more sensitive or contentious than his handling of the sexual abuse of children by members of the clergy.
While he's widely considered to have gone further than his predecessors in acknowledging victims and reforming the Church's own internal procedures, many survivors do not think he went far enough.

Alexa MacPherson's abuse by a Catholic priest began around the age of three and continued for six years.
""When I was nine-and-a-half, my father caught him trying to rape me on the living room couch,"" she told me when we met on the Boston waterfront.
""For me, it was pretty much an everyday occurrence.""
On discovering the abuse, her father called the police.
A court hearing for a criminal complaint against the priest, Peter Kanchong, accused of assault and battery of a minor, was set for 24 August 1984.
But unbeknownst to the family, something extraordinary was taking place behind the scenes.
The Church â an institution that wielded enormous power in a deeply Catholic city â believed that the court was on its side.
""The court is attempting to handle the matter in such a way as to help Father Peter and to avoid scandal to the Church,"" the then-Archbishop of Boston, Bernard Law, wrote in a letter that would remain hidden for years.
Alexa MacPherson believes there is so much more the Catholic Church can do about child abuse
Reflecting on the events of more than four decades ago, Ms MacPherson recognises that her abuse took place long before Francis became pope.
But over that same period, through a series of global scandals which are still unfolding, the issue of the systemic sexual exploitation of children has become the modern Church's biggest challenge.
It is a challenge she believes Pope Francis failed to rise to, as she made clear when I asked her how she had reacted to the news of his death.
""I actually don't feel like I had much of a reaction,"" she replied.
""And I don't want to take away from the good that he did do, but there's just so much more that the Church and the Vatican and the people in charge can do.""
The 1984 letter from Archbishop Bernard Law was addressed to a bishop in Thailand.
Mentioning the accusation of ""child molestation"" it was written two months after the Boston court hearing, which had indeed concluded without scandal for the Church.
Peter Kanchong - who was originally from Thailand - had been spared from formal criminal charges and given a year's probation on the condition that he stayed away from the MacPherson family and underwent a course of psychological therapy.
The Archbishop's letter, however, noted that even the Church's own psychological evaluation had determined that the accused priest was ""not motivated and unresponsive to therapy"" and should therefore be ""forced to face the consequences of his actions"" under both civil and Church law.
But instead of acting on that advice, he implored the Thai bishop to immediately recall Peter Kanchong to his diocese in Thailand, mentioning for a second time the risk of ""grave scandal"" if he were to remain in the US.
Although press reports from the time suggest the Church authorities in Thailand did agree to take him back, Peter Kanchong ignored the recall, finding work in the Boston area at a facility for adults with learning disabilities.
In 2002, more than 18 years after Ms MacPherson's father first called the police, the archbishop's letter was made public.
In a landmark ruling, it was one of thousands of pages of documents that a Boston court ordered the Catholic Church to release.

A local newspaper, The Boston Globe, had, for the first time, begun to seriously challenge the institution's power in the city, by placing the stories of victims on its front pages.
Soon, hundreds had come forward and their lawyers were fighting in court to prise open decades of internal records relating to the sexual abuse of children.
The Church had tried to argue that the First Amendment protection for freedom of religion entitled it to keep those files secret.
The order to unseal them led to a watershed moment.
Contacted at the time, Peter Kanchong denied the allegations.
""Do you have evidence? Do you have witnesses?"" he told the Boston Globe, who found him still living in the area.
Ms MacPherson, however, was one of more than 500 victims who won an $85m civil case for the abuse they'd suffered at the hands of dozens of priests.
The internal files showed that, time and again, Archbishop Law had dealt with his knowledge of abuse in the same way he'd attempted to deal with Peter Kanchong - by simply moving priests on to new parishes.
After the settlement, and by then a Cardinal, Bernard Law resigned from his position in Boston and moved to Rome.
For the survivors, the sense of Church impunity was further compounded when he was given the honour of a seven-year post as Archpriest of the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the same building where Pope Francis has now been buried.
Bernard Law died in Rome in 2017
Many Church insiders credit Francis with going further than his predecessors to address the issue of abuse.
In 2019, he summoned more than a hundred bishops to Rome for a conference on the crisis.
In the abuse of children, he told them, ""We see the hand of evil.""
The conference led to a revision of the Church law on ""pontifical secrecy"" allowing co-operation with the civil courts when required in cases of abuse.
The change, however, doesn't compel the disclosure of all information relating to child abuse, only its disclosure in specific cases when formally requested by a legitimate authority.
Similarly, a new law requiring that allegations be referred up the internal Church hierarchy stops short of mandating referral to the police.
Ms MacPherson's lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, a man portrayed in the Hollywood blockbuster Spotlight about the Boston abuse scandal, told me there are plenty of ways the Church continues to exercise secrecy.
""We have to litigate in court to get documents, nothing really has changed,"" he said.
His 2002 legal victory may have been a defining moment, followed by an avalanche of such cases in dozens of countries, but he has no doubt that knowledge of wrongdoing remains hidden in churches around the world.
""While he did some things, it's not enough,"" Ms MacPherson told me when I asked for her assessment of Pope Francis' record on this issue.
Critics believe Pope Francis didn't do enough to tackle the issue of child abuse
She wants the Church to reveal everything it knows.
""One of the biggest things is turning over predatory priests and the people who covered it up and holding them accountable in a regular court of law and not shielding them and hiding them any longer.""
Watching the endless news of the Pope's funeral and the preparations for the appointment of his successor has been painful for her.
""It's the abuse being celebrated, in a way,"" she told me, ""Because the cover-ups are still there, they're shielded behind the Vatican walls and their canon laws.""
It is news coverage she's found hard to escape because of her mother's continuing faith in the Catholic Church.
""It's all I've heard on the news, and she is obsessed with watching this, and so I just get slammed and inundated with it.""
Now 85-years-old, Peter Kanchong meanwhile has never been convicted of an offence.
Nor has he been stripped of his priesthood, although he has been prevented from holding any formal position in the Boston Diocese.
The Church's own published list of accused clergy marks his case as ""not yet resolved"" with no final determination of guilt or innocence, noting simply that he is ""AWOL"" - absent without leave.
""I've been trying for years to have him defrocked and that is because he can only be defrocked either where he was ordained, which was in Thailand, or by the Vatican,"" Ms MacPherson said.
She points out that the Church has gone to the trouble of changing the name of the parish where she was abused - in order, she believes, to try to start afresh after what took place there.
The BBC asked the Boston Diocese for its views on Pope Francis' legacy as well as for a response to claims that the Catholic Church maintains a culture of secrecy over its own internal records.
We received no reply to those questions.
We also asked whether the current archbishop could do anything to help victims seeking to remove a priest from the priesthood.
We were referred to the Vatican.
As the Catholic Church now sets about the business of electing a new pope, Ms MacPherson holds little hope for more comprehensive reform.
""You say you want to move forward. You say you want to bring people back into the fold,"" she said.
""But you cannot possibly do any of that until you truly acknowledge those sins, and you hold those people accountable."""

The only surviving guest of a deadly beef wellington lunch at the heart of a high-profile Australian court case has described being run down a hospital corridor to urgent care after medical staff realised he had eaten toxic mushrooms.
Ian Wilkinson told the courtroom on Tuesday that he and his wife Heather had been ""very happy to be invited"" to the lunch hosted by Erin Patterson. 
But the meal left Heather and two other relatives dead, and Mr Wilkinson seriously ill.
Ms Patterson, who is on trial for the murder of three people and the attempted murder of another, has pleaded not guilty and her defence team says she ""panicked"" after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.
Three people died in hospital in the days after the meal: Ms Patterson's former in-laws, Don and Gail Patterson, as well as Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson.
Mr Wilkinson, a local pastor, survived after spending seven weeks in hospital, including three weeks in intensive care at the Austin hospital in Melbourne. He gave the packed courtroom details about the lunch, describing how he and his wife took ill afterwards, and being told by medical staff that the situation was ""serious"". 
The jury has heard that there is no dispute that the lunch of beef wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans contained death cap mushrooms and caused the guests' illnesses.
Whether Ms Patterson intended to kill or cause very serious injury is the main issue in the case, the judge has told the jury.
Mr Wilkinson told the court that Ms Patterson had plated ""all of the food"".
""Each person had an individual serve, it was very much like a pasty,"" he said. ""It was a pastry case and when we cut into it, there was steak and mushrooms.""
He added that Gail and Heather picked up four grey plates with the food and set them on the table, while Ms Patterson ate from an ""orangey tan"" coloured plate.
""Erin picked up the odd plate and carried it to the table. She took it to her place at the table,"" he said. He also said that his wife told him in hospital the next day that she had ""noticed the difference in colours"" of the plates.

After eating the lunch, Mr Wilkinson recalled being unwell through the night with vomiting and diarrhoea.
Ms Patterson's ex-husband Simon Patterson, who last week told court he'd declined an invitation to the lunch, had visited them after discovering his parents had been ill the whole night as well. He had insisted on calling an ambulance as his own parents had done. But the wait for an ambulance was too long, so Simon drove them to a local hospital, and then to Leongatha hospital, Mr Wilkinson said.
Mr Wilkinson said that doctors had first treated them as food poisoning cases and ""suspicion was falling on the meat"", adding that he could not recall mention of mushrooms at the time.
But the next morning, they were ""abruptly woken up by a group of nurses who literally ran us down the corridor in our beds to the urgent care area,"" he said. A doctor then told the couple that ""he'd had communication ... saying it was suspected mushroom poisoning"".
""He was very frank. He said it is a very serious situation. He said there was time critical treatment available.""
The pair were then taken by ambulance to Dandenong hospital.
Earlier in the day, Mr Wilkinson was shown a picture of the dining room table on an iPad and he marked where each of the five people at the lunch had been seated. 
He said that both he and Heather ""ate the entire meal"", while Don ate his meal along with half of the beef wellington that Gail did not finish.
""There was talk about husbands helping their wives out.""
He said Ms Patterson was ""definitely"" eating but couldn't say ""with certainty"" how much she ate.
There was a cake for dessert as well as a fruit platter but Mr Wilkinson told the court that not much was eaten because everyone was full from the main course.
Erin Patterson sat emotionless as Mr Wilkinson testified
When asked about his relationship with Ms Patterson, Mr Wilkinson said: ""I would say our relationship was friendly, amicable. It did not have much depth. We were more like acquaintances. We didn't see a great deal of each other.""
""She just seemed like a normal person to me,"" he added. ""When we met things were friendly. We never had arguments or disputes. She just seemed like an ordinary person.""
""Heather would have seen Erin more than me, talked to her more than me but we did not consider that the relationship was close,"" he said.
The invitation was made to Heather Wilkinson at church, a week or two earlier, Mr Wilkinson recalled.
""We were very happy to be invited. It seemed like maybe our relationship was going to improve,"" he said.
""We were very happy to accept.""
The court was shown a copy of Mrs Wilkinson's diary where she had written, ""Erin for lunch"" with a pencil. 
Written in blue ink: ""12:00"" - which Mr Wilkinson said was the time they were to be picked up by Don and Gail Patterson. Another word ""fruit"" in the diary referred to the fruit platter they were taking to the lunch, he said.
The beef wellington lunch contained death cap mushrooms that made the guests ill
Mr Wilkinson said that after the lunch, Erin Patterson announced that she had cancer â something the defence has already told the jury it accepted was a false claim.
""She said she was very concerned because she believed it was very serious, life-threatening,"" he said. ""She was anxious about telling the kids. She was asking our advice about that. 'Should I tell the kids or not tell the kids about this threat to my life?'
""She was asking, 'What do you think I should do?""
""In that moment, I thought this is the reason we've been invited to the lunch,"" said Mr Wilkinson, adding that he ""didn't quite catch"" what type of cancer she had said.
""I thought it was some sort of ovarian or cervical cancer - something like that.""
He said it was a ""relatively short conversation"" and felt like it lasted around 10 minutes. The discussion ended because the Patterson children and a friend were arriving back at the house. 
""I realised we weren't able to continue, and that we hadn't prayed about it,"" Mr Wilkinson said. ""I suggested we pray and I asked a prayer asking for God's blessing that Erin would get the treatment she needed, that the kids would be okay.""
Ms Patterson, wearing a light pink striped shirt sat emotionless as Mr Wilkinson began his evidence.
Last week when the trial opened, her lawyer said there was no intent to hurt anyone and the deaths were the result of a tragic accident - though many of the facts are not in dispute and it is accepted that she lied several times to police.
On Monday the jury heard from members of a true crime Facebook group that Ms Patterson was part of.
One of the witnesses, Christine Hunt, was asked about Erin Patterson's relationship with her estranged husband Simon.
She told the court that the words ""controlling"" and ""coercive"" had been used by Ms Patterson.
Another member of the same group, Daniela Barkley, told the court that Erin Patterson had been ""excited"" about buying a dehydrator, and the jury was shown several images shared with the group, which showed mushrooms drying on the metal racks of the appliance.
In a text message shown to the court, Ms Patterson said ""I've been hiding powdered mushrooms in everything"" - including recipes such as brownies so her children couldn't tell they were eating them.
The court also heard that in July 2023, she'd asked the group for advice on cooking a beef Wellington, the dish that was served to the four guests at that deadly lunch later the same month."

Germany's parliament is set to elect conservative Friedrich Merz as new Chancellor.
The 69-year old is promising to revitalize the country's flagging economy and boost its voice on the world stage.
It brings an end to Germany's recent political limbo after the last government collapsed.
But Merz takes office at a time of huge uncertainty abroad and a surging far-right at home.
""It's our historical duty to make this government a success,"" said the CDU leader on Monday, as he officially signed the coalition agreement.
Merz's supporters argue that what they see as good government can help address growing voter discontent.
""I think we really need to prove that we solve the problems, not in a radical way, just in a very responsible, visible, detailed way,"" says Mark Helfrich, a CDU member of the Bundestag.
But the CDU, CSU and SPD coalition have a narrow majority with 328 seats â just a dozen more than the minimum required.
In February's federal election, the CDU/CSU nudged up its support by just four points while coalition partner, the SPD, crashed to its worst post-war result.
Merz has promised to tighten immigration rules, invest in the nation's ailing infrastructure and rebuild ties with key European partners.
He already steered through a law to exempt defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules â knowing that in the new parliament he wouldn't be able to find the necessary majority to do so.
""A remarkable decision,"" says Claudia Major, a senior vice-president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.
But because support for the governing parties is relatively low, ""Merz will need to convince the broader public of the necessity to spend more on defence"".
Merz will continue to invest in Germany's relationship with the US, says Claudia Major
Snapping at Merz's heels throughout this parliament will be the far-right Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD), now the main opposition force in the Bundestag.
The AfD wants to close Germany's borders, deport migrants en masse, end weapons supplies to Ukraine and re-open ties with Putin's Russia.
Last week, the AfD was officially classed as an extremist organisation by domestic intelligence (BfV), re-igniting a debate about whether the party should be banned.
The AfD has now said it's suing the BfV, accusing it of an ""abuse"" of power.
And the designation was publicly denounced by senior figures in Donald Trump's US administration â including vice president JD Vance.
Managing relationships with Trump's White House will be another balancing act for Merz, a committed Atlanticist who raised eyebrows on election night when he declared Europe should ""achieve independence from the USA"".
Nevertheless, Merz's government will ""invest a lot to keep the transatlantic relationship going"" says the GMF's Claudia Major.
There's speculation he may even ""go for golf"" â a reference to seeking to woo golf-mad Trump by playing some holes out on the fairway.
But Merz's first trips abroad are set to be to Paris and Warsaw, relationships he claims suffered under Olaf Scholz.
It's ""high time"" to improve German-Polish relations, says Agnieszka Pomaska, a member of Prime Minister Donald Tusk's Civic Platform party who chairs the European Union Affairs Committee in the Polish parliament.
""We need to invest together in the army, in defence,"" says Pomaska, who says that Scholz's government was ""politically weak"" and ""it's never easy to cooperate with a government that is simply weak"".
""We didn't have this feeling that was very much present during previous years that Germany is one of the leaders in the European Union.""

The pace at 64-year-old Thirunavkarsu's spinning mill in southern India's Tamil Nadu state has noticeably slowed down. 
The viscose yarn â a popular material that goes into making woven garments â he produces, now sits in storage, as orders from local factories have dropped nearly 40% in the last month.
That's because Chinese imports of the material have become cheaper by 15 rupees ($0.18; Â£0.13) per kilo and flooded Indian ports.
With Donald Trump imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods going into the US, manufacturers in China have begun looking for alternative markets.
India's textiles makers say they are bearing the brunt of the trade tensions as Chinese producers are dumping yarn in key production hubs.
While China is the leading producer of viscose yarn, India makes most of the viscose yarn the country needs locally with imports only bridging supply gaps.
Mill owners like Thirunavkarsu fear their yarn won't survive the onslaught of such competition.
""We can't match these rates. Our raw material is not as cheap,"" he says.
Jagadesh Chandran, of the South India Spinners Association, told the BBC nearly 50 small spinning mills in the textile hubs of Pallipalayam, Karur and Tirupur in southern India are ""slowing production"". Many say they'll be forced to scale down further if the issue isn't addressed.
India recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports
China's Ambassador to India, Xu Feihong, has sent assurances to India that his country will not dump products and in fact wants to buy more high-quality Indian products for Chinese consumers.
""We will not engage in market dumping or cut-throat competition, nor will we disrupt other countries' industries and economic development,"" he wrote in an opinion piece for the Indian Express newspaper.
But anxieties about dumping are spread across sectors in India, as China - Asia's biggest economy - is the world's largest exporter of practically all industrial goods, from textiles and metals, to chemicals and rare minerals.
While pharmaceuticals - and later phones, laptops, and semiconductor chips - were exempted from steep tariffs, large chunks of Chinese exports still run into Trump's 145% tariff wall. It is these goods that are expected to chase other markets like India.
Their sudden inflow will prove ""very disruptive"" to emerging economies in Asia, according to Japanese broking house Nomura, whose research earlier revealed that China was flooding global markets with cheap goods even before Donald Trump took office earlier this year.
In 2024, investigations against unfair Chinese imports rose to a record high. Data from the World Trade Organization (WTO) shows nearly 200 complaints were filed against China at the forum - a record - including 37 from India.
India, in particular, with heavy dependencies on Chinese raw materials and intermediate goods, could be hit hard. Its trade deficit with China - the difference between what it imports and exports - has already ballooned to $100bn (Â£75bn). And imports in March jumped 25%, driven by electronics, batteries and solar cells.
In response, India's trade ministry has set up a committee to track the influx of cheap Chinese goods, with its quasi-judicial arm probing imports across sectors, including viscose yarn.
India also recently imposed a 12% tax on some steel imports, locally known as a safeguard duty, to help halt an increase in cheap shipments primarily from China, which were pushing some Indian mills to scale down.
Despite such protections - and a loud marketing campaign by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to boost manufacturing locally - India has found it hard to reduce its reliance on China, with imports rising even when border tensions between the two neighbours peaked after 2020. 
That's because the government has only had ""limited success"" with its plans to turn India into the world's factory through things like the production linked subsidies, says Biswajit Dhar, a Delhi-based trade expert. And India continues to depend heavily on China for the intermediate goods that go into manufacturing finished products. 
The majority of the iPhones bound for the US market in the coming months will be made in India
While western multi-national companies like Apple are increasingly looking towards India to diversify their assembly lines away from China, India is still dependent on Chinese components to make these phones. As a result, imports in sectors like electronics have risen significantly, pushing up its trade deficit.
India's burgeoning deficit is a ""worrying story"", says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) think tank, all the more so because its exports to China have dropped to below 2014 levels despite a weaker currency, which should ideally help exporters.
""This isn't just a trade imbalance. It's a structural warning. Our industrial growth, including through PLI (production linked incentive) schemes, is fuelling imports, not building domestic depth,"" Srivastava wrote in a social media post. In other words, the subsidies are not helping India export more. 
""We can't bridge this deficit without bridging our competitiveness gap.""
India needs to get its act together quickly to do that, given the opportunity US trade tensions with China have presented. But also because countries with a large rise in imports from China generally tend to see the sharpest slowdown in manufacturing growth, according to Nomura.
Akash Prakash of Amansa Capital agrees. A key reason why Indian private companies were not investing enough, was because they feared being ""swamped by China"", he wrote in a column in the Business Standard newspaper. A recent study by the ratings agency Icra also corroborates this view. 
With fears of Chinese dumping becoming more widespread and the likes of the European Union seeking firm guarantees from Beijing that its markets will not be flooded, pressure is mounting on China - which is now urgently looking to secure newer trading partners outside the US.
China wants to completely shift the narrative, says Mr Dhar, ""It is trying to come clean amidst increased scrutiny"".
Despite the reassurances from Beijing, Delhi should use thawing relations with its larger neighbour to kickstart a proper dialogue on its firm stance about dumping, says Mr Dhar.
""This is an issue that India must flag, like most of the Western countries have.""

This must be the most secretive election in the world.
When 133 Catholic cardinals are shut into the Sistine Chapel on Wednesday to choose a successor to Pope Francis, each one will have sworn an oath on the gospels to keep the details under wraps for life.
The same goes for every person inside the Vatican during the conclave: from the two doctors on hand for any emergency, to the dining-room staff who feed the cardinals. All vow to observe ""absolute and perpetual secrecy"".
Just to be sure, the chapel and the two guesthouses will be swept for microphones and bugs.
""There are electronic jammers to make sure that phone and wi-fi signals are not getting in or out,"" said John Allen, the editor of Crux news site.
""The Vatican takes the idea of isolation extremely seriously.""
The famous lockdown is not only about keeping the voting process itself secret: stopping ""nefarious forces"" from attempting to hack it for information or to disrupt things.
The measures are also about ensuring the men in red total seclusion from the secular world and its influences as they prepare to vote.
Catholics will tell you the election is guided by God, not politics. But the hierarchy takes no chances.
On entering the conclave, everyone is obliged to surrender all electronic devices including phones, tablets and smart watches. The Vatican has its own police to enforce the rules.
""The logic is trust but verify,"" John Allen said.
""There are no televisions, newspapers or radio at the guesthouse for the conclave â nothing,"" said Monsignor Paolo de Nicolo, who was head of the Papal household for three decades.
""You can't even open the windows because many rooms have windows to the exterior world.""
Msgr Paolo de Nicolo says there are no televisions, newspapers or radios at the guesthouse for the conclave 
Everyone working behind the high Vatican walls for the conclave has been heavily vetted. Even so, they are barred from communicating with electors.
""The cardinals are completely incommunicado,"" said Ines San Martin of the Pontifical Mission Societies in the US.
""There will just be walkie-talkies for some specific circumstances like, 'we need a medic,' or 'Hey, the Pope has been elected, can someone let the bell-ringers in the Basilica know.'""
So what if someone breaks the rules?
""There is an oath, and those who do not observe it risk ex-communication,"" Msgr De Nicolo says, meaning exclusion from the church. ""No one dares to do this.""
It's a different matter in the run-up to the conclave.
Officially, the cardinals are banned from commenting even now. But from the moment Pope Francis was buried, parts of the Italian press and many visitors turned cardinal-hunters, trying to suss out his most likely successor.
They have been scouring the tourist-filled restaurants and gelato joints around the Vatican, ready to speculate on any sightings and possible alliances.
""Wine and Rigatoni: the Cardinals' Last Suppers"", was one headline in La Repubblica which described the ""princes of the church"" enjoying ""good Roman lunches"" before lockdown.
Reporters have then been grilling waiters on what they might have overheard.
""Nothing,"" one of the servers at Roberto's, a couple of streets back from St Peter's, told me this week.
""They always go quiet whenever we get close.""
Journalists are on the lookout for the cardinals ahead of the conclave 
The other prime spot to catch a cardinal is beside the basilica itself, next to the curve of columns that embraces the main square. Each morning there's a huddle of cameras and reporters on the lookout for the men in lace and scarlet robes.
There are now close to 250 cardinals in the city, called here from all over the world, although those aged 80 or over are not eligible to vote.
As they head into the Vatican for their daily congregations to discuss the election, each one is surrounded and bombarded with questions on progress.
They've given away little in response beyond the ""need for unity"" or assurances that the conclave will be short.
""The whole idea is for this to be a religious decision, not a political one,"" Ines San Martin explains. ""We say the Holy Spirit guides the conversation and the vote.""
But the Pope heads a huge, wealthy institution with significant moral authority and global sway on everything from conflict resolution to sexual politics.
So the man chosen â and his vision and priorities â matter far beyond the Vatican.
Certain Catholic monarchs had a veto on the election up until 1907. Today, voices from all quarters try to influence the debate â most obviously through the media.
At one point, Rome's Il Messaggero chided a presumed front-runner, Italian Cardinal Parolin, for ""a sort of self-candidacy"".
Then there was a video clip of Filipino Cardinal Tagle singing John Lennon's Imagine, apparently released to dent his popularity. It went viral instead.
John Allen says cardinals block out any interference ahead of the vote  
Meanwhile, a glossy book highlighting some potential contenders is doing the rounds, lauding conservatives like Cardinal Sarah of Guinea for condemning the ""contemporary evils"" of abortion and the ""same-sex agenda"".
""There are groups in town who are trying to bang the drum on issues of interest to them,"" John Allen says. ""The cardinals are aware of this kind of thing, they read the papers. But they will do everything they can to block it out.""
""Are there lobbies going on? Yes, like in every election,"" Ines San Martin agrees. ""But it's not as loud as I thought it would be.""
She argues that is partly because Pope Francis appointed so many new cardinals, including from new places.
""Fifty or sixty percent of them don't even know one another. So even if you were an outside group, trying to have an agenda, it's very hard even to pick your cardinals to begin with.""
By Wednesday morning, all the electors should be in place inside the Vatican â stripped of their phones and sealed off from the rest of the world.
From then on John Allen believes personal preference will dominate over politics, liberal or conservative factions or the ""rattle and hum of public debate"".
""I really think the cardinals' discussions among themselves right now is key,"" Ines San Martin agrees. ""A lot have been speaking up for the first time. You never know just how inspiring one of them might be.""

I ran from the White House briefing room, past the portico entrance of the West Wing to our camera position on the lawn, and flung on an ear piece connecting me to the studio.
A moment later the presenter asked me about the comments we had just heard live from US President Donald Trump.
I said we were seeing a fundamental shift in a United States'â¯policy position after decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It was February this year, and Trump had just held talks with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - the first foreign leader since Trump's inauguration to be invited to the White House. The US president vowed that his country would take control of the Gaza Strip, having earlier pledged the territory would also be ""cleaned out"" and emptied of its Palestinian population.
Trump was grabbing the world's attention with a proposal that hardened his administration's support for Israel and also upended international norms, flying in the face of international law. It marked an apex of the current Republican Party's relationship with Israel - sometimes described as support ""at all costs"".
The alliance between the US and Israel has been thrust into the international spotlight since the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's military response
The alliance between the two countries had been thrust into the international spotlight after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023 and Israel's offensive in Gaza that followed.
During that war, the administration of President Joe Biden sent some $18bn (Â£13.5bn) worth of weapons to Israel, maintaining unprecedented levels of US backing. The period was marked by intensifying protests in the US, with many of those protesting being traditional Democrat leaning voters. The fallout became the focus of a bitter culture war centring on American attitudes towards Israel and the Palestinians. I covered demonstrations in which protesters repeatedly labelled Biden ""Genocide Joe"" â an accusation he always rejected.
At the time Donald Trump branded the protesters ""radical-left lunatics"" and the Trump administration is now targeting for deportation hundreds of foreign students who it accuses of antisemitism or support for Hamas, a move being vigorously challenged in the courts.
But as a Democrat who could otherwise have expected the vote of many of those upset over his support for Israel that support was politically costly for Biden in a way not experienced by previous presidents or, indeed, Trump.
One of Biden's key decision makers over relations with Israel still wrestles with the decisions they took.
""My first reaction is just, I understand that this has evoked incredibly passionate feelings for Arab Americans, for non-Arab Americans, Jewish Americans,"" says Jake Sullivan, Biden's former national security adviser.
""There were two competing considerations: one was wanting to curb Israel's excesses, both with respect to civilian casualties and the flow of humanitarian assistance. The other was [...] wanting to make sure that we were not cutting Israel off from the capabilities it needed to confront its enemies on multiple different fronts.""
He added: ""The United States stood behind Israel materially, morally, and in every other way in those days following October 7th.""
Tom Bateman examines the history of the special relationship between the United States and Israel.
Listen now on BBC Sounds.
But opinion polls suggest support for Israel among the American public is dwindling.
A Gallup survey taken in March this year found only 46% of Americans expressed support for Israel (the lowest level in 25 years of Gallup's annual tracking) while 33% now said they sympathised with the Palestinians - the highest ever reading of that measure. Other polls have found similar results.
Surveys - with all their limitations - suggest the swing is largely among Democrats and the young, although not exclusively. Between 2022 and 2025, the Pew Research Center found that the proportion of Republicans who said they had unfavourable views of Israel rose from 27% to 37%  (younger Republicans, aged under 49, drove most of that change).
The US has long been Israel's most powerful ally - ever since May 1948, when America was the first country to recognise the nascent State of Israel. But while US support for Israel is extremely likely to continue long-term, these swings in sentiment raise questions over the practical extent and policy limits of the US's ironclad backing and whether the shifting sands of public opinion will eventually feed through to Washington, with real-world policy impacts.
To many, the close relationship between the US and Israel seems like a permanent, unshakeable part of the geopolitical infrastructure. But it wasn't always guaranteed - and at the very beginning largely came down to one man.
In early 1948, US President Harry S Truman had to decide on his approach to Palestine. The country was in the grip of sectarian bloodshed between Jews and Arab Palestinians after three decades of colonial rule by Britain, which had announced its intention to pull out. Truman was deeply moved by the plight of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust stranded in displaced persons camps in Europe.
In New York City, a young Francine Klagsbrun, who would later become an academic and historian of Israeli prime minister Golda Meir, watched her parents praying for a Jewish homeland.
The US president vowed that his country would take control of the Gaza Strip
""I grew up in a very Jewish home and a very Zionist home also,"" she explains. ""So my older brother and I would go out and collect money to try to get England to open the doors. My brother would go on the subway trains, all the doors open on the train and he'd shout 'open, open, open the doors to Palestine',"" she recalls.
Truman's administration was deeply divided over whether to back a Jewish state. The CIA and the Department of State cautioned against recognising a Jewish state. They feared a bloody conflict with Arab countries that might draw in the US, risking Cold War escalation with the Soviets.
Two days before Britain was due to pull out of Palestine, an explosive row took place in the Oval Office. Truman's domestic advisor Clark Clifford argued in favour of recognising a Jewish state. On the other side of the debate was Secretary of State George Marshall, a World War Two general whom Truman viewed as ""the greatest living American"".
The man Truman admired so much was vigorously opposed to the president immediately recognising a Jewish state because of his fears about a regional war - and even went as far as telling Truman he would not vote for him in the coming presidential election if he backed recognition.
The US has been Israel's strongest ally since 1948, when it became the first country to recognise the newly declared state
But despite the moment of extraordinary tension, Truman immediately recognised the State of Israel when it was declared two days later by David Ben-Gurion, the country's first prime minister.
The historian Rashid Khalidi, a New York-born Palestinian whose family members were expelled from Jerusalem by the British in the 1930s, says the US and Israel were fused together in part by shared cultural connections. From 1948 onwards, he says, the Palestinians had a critical diplomatic disadvantage in the US, with their claim to national self-determination sidelined in an unequal contest.
President Harry S. Truman immediately recognised the State of Israel when it was declared by David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister.
""On the one side, you had the Zionist movement led by people whom are European and American by originâ¦ The Arabs had nothing similar,"" he says. ""[The Arabs] weren't familiar with the societies, the cultures, the political leaderships of the countries that decided the fate of Palestine. How could you speak to American public opinion if you had no idea what America is like?"" says Khalidi.
Popular culture played its role too - notably the 1958 novel and subsequent blockbuster film Exodus by the author Leon Uris. It retold the story of Israel's establishment to mass audiences of the 1960s, the movie version creating a heavily Americanised portrayal of pioneers in a new land.
Former Israeli PM Ehud Olmert says the 1967 war was a turning point, solidifying America's deep military and political support for Israel
Ehud Olmert, who at the time was a political activist but would later become Israeli prime minister, points to the war of 1967 as the moment when America's support for Israel became the profound alliance that it is today.
That was the war in which Israel, after weeks of escalating fears of invasion by its neighbours, defeated the Arab countries in six days, effectively tripling the size of its territory, and launching its military occupation over (at that time) more than a million stateless Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
""For the first time, the United States understood the importance and the significance of Israel as a major military and political power in the Middle East, and since then everything has changed in the basic relations within our two countries,"" he says.
Over the years, Israel became the biggest recipient of US foreign military aid on Earth. Strong American diplomatic support, particularly at the United Nations, has been a key element of the alliance; while successive US presidents have also sought to broker peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours.
But in recent years it has been far from a straightforward relationship.
When I spoke to Jake Sullivan, I put to him the issue of Arab Americans in the state of Michigan who boycotted Biden and his successor candidate Kamala Harris over the extent of their support for Israel during the Gaza conflict, voting instead for Trump. He rejected the idea that Biden lost the state because of this support.
But that backing still prompted a marked backlash within a section of the American public.
A Pew Research Center survey taken in March this year found that 53% of Americans expressed an unfavourable opinion of Israel, an 11 point increase since the last time the survey was taken in 2022.
Currently, these shifts in public opinion haven't yet prompted a major change in US foreign policy. Whilst some ordinary US voters are turning away from Israel, on Capitol Hill elected politicians from both parties are still mostly keen to talk up the importance of a strong alliance with Israel.
Some think that a sustained, long-term shift in public opinion might eventually lead to reduced real-world support for the country - with weaker diplomatic ties and reduced military aid. This issue is felt particularly sharply by some inside Israel. Several months before 7 October, the former Israeli general and head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, Tamir Hayman, warned of cracks forming between his country and the United States, in part because of what he described as the slow movement of American Jews away from Zionism.
Israel's political shift in favour of the national-religious right has played a key part in this. From early 2023, Israel was gripped by an unprecedented wave of protests among Jewish Israelis against Netanyahu's judicial reforms, with many arguing he was moving the country towards theocracy â a claim he always rejected. Some in the US who had always felt a deep sense of connection with Israel were watching with growing concern.
Jake Sullivan says he continues to wrestle with the question of whether the Biden administration could have done anything differently after 7 October.
In March this year, the Institute for National Security Studies, a leading Tel Aviv-based think tank led by Hayman, published a paper arguing that US public opinion had entered the ""danger zone"", as far as support for Israel was concerned. ""The dangers of diminished US support, particularly as it reflects long-term and deeply rooted trends, cannot be overstated,"" wrote the paper's author, Theodore Sasson. ""Israel needs the support of the global superpower for the foreseeable future,"".
That support at the policy level has only strengthened over the decades, but it is important to note that historic American opinion polling shows public opinion has ebbed and flowed before.
Today, Dennis Ross, who helped negotiate the Oslo accords with President Bill Clinton, says American opinion on Israel has become increasingly tied to sharp political divisions in the US.
""Trump is viewed very negatively by most Democrats - the latest polls show over 90 percent,"" Ross says. ""There's potential for Trumpian support for Israel to feed a dynamic here that, at least among Democrats, increases criticism of Israel.""
But he expects that Washington's support for Israel - in the form of military aid and diplomatic ties - will continue. And he thinks if Israeli voters eject their prime minister and replace him with a more centrist government, one that may reverse some of the disquiet in the US. A general election must be held in Israel before late October next year.
Under such a new Israeli government, Ross argues, ""there won't be the same impulse towards creating de-facto annexation of the West Bank. There'll be much more outreach to the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party officials.""
Dennis Ross says most Democrats have a very negative view of Trump, with recent polls showing more than 90% dislike him
Those who see a fraying relationship are paying particularly close attention to the views of younger Americans - a group that has shown the most marked shift in opinion since 7 October. As the 'TikTok generation', many young Americans get their news about the war from social media and the high civilian death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza appears to have driven the declining support among young Democrats and liberals in America. Last year, 33 percent of Americans under 30 said their sympathies lie entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, versus 14 percent who said the same about Israelis, according to a Pew Research poll published last month. Older Americans were more likely to sympathise with the Israelis.
Karin Von Hippel, chair of the Arden Defence and Security Practice and a former official in the US State Department, agrees there is a demographic divide among Americans on the topic of Israel - one that even extends to Congress.
""Younger Congress men and women are less knee jerk, reactively supporting Israel,"" she says. ""And I think younger Americans, including Jewish Americans, are less supportive of Israel than their parents were.""
Many young Americans are said to get their news about the Gaza war from social media
But she is sceptical of the idea that this might lead to a serious change at the policy level. Despite changing opinions among the party's base, she says, many of the most prominent Democrats who might run for President in 2028 are ""classically supportive of Israel"". She names Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, and Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary, as examples. And what about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Instagram-famous congresswoman who is a long-standing supporter of Palestinian rights? Hippel responds bluntly: ""I don't think an Ocasio-Cortez type can win right now.""
In the weeks after February's Trump-Netanyahu press conference at the White House, I asked Jake Sullivan where he thought the US-Israel relationship was going. He argued that both countries were dealing with internal threats to their democratic institutions that would define their character and their relationship.
""I think it's almost less of a foreign policy question than it is a domestic policy question in these two countries - whither America and whither Israel?"" he says. ""The answer to those two questions will tell you where does the US-Israel relationship go five, ten, fifteen years from now.""

Stewards have been stationed next to the Molly Malone statue in Dublin to discourage people from touching it.
The city's council is running the pilot scheme after it received complaints about people groping the sculpture's breasts.
The practice is thought to have been started by a local tour guide, and the bronze has now become discoloured from years of touching.
Ray Yeates, the Arts Officer for Dublin City Council said stewards were in place to have a ""conversation"" with people about touching Molly Malone.
The stewards are in place at the Molly Malone statue until the end of this week only
""They're not guards or police, it's a gentle confrontation of the behaviour,"" he said.
""Some people say, and they have a point to make, that it's being touched inappropriately,"" he told BBC News NI.
While he said it was a ""worldwide phenomenon that statues are touched or rubbed and it becomes a custom,"" some people had ""made a good point where we're mimicking behaviour we don't want to see in public"".
""It would be illegal in public, so why would we mimic it?""
However, he added that, at the same time, ""some people see no harm in this whatsoever and think it's a very trivial matter for council to be involved in"".
Ray Yeates says damage is being done to the statue
""There is a question of damage because several thousand Euro of damage would be done every few months.
""This is damaging the statue and it is upsetting people.""
Mr Yeates said other options such as moving the statue's location, raising it on a plinth or repairing it more regularly, were being considered.
The sculpture has been in Dublin since 1988 in tribute to a woman who sold shellfish on the streets of the Irish capital.
Over the years she's come to represent the city's working people and many believe, Molly Malone deserves more respect.
BBC News NI asked people on the streets of Dublin what they think.
Tilly Cripwell busks beside the statue
Music activist Tilly Cripwell started the Leave Molly mAlone campaign last year.
""I spent loads of hours busking beside the Molly Malone statue and got more and more annoyed at hundreds of people touching the statue's breasts for good luck,"" she said.
""It's become what some people think is a tradition,"" she said.
""I'm bored of seeing this kind of misogynistic behaviour normalised in culture.""
Tilly said she'd like to see the Molly Malone sculpture raised on a plinth, with a plaque denoting the history behind it.
""These are also examples we're setting to younger generations,"" she said.
""She needs respect so that she is awarded the honour she deserves by being such an iconic woman in Irish culture.""
As the stewards were on duty, she placed a sign bearing her campaign name around the neck of the Molly Malone statue while setting up for a busking slot, but it was quickly removed by a passer-by.
Clodagh Keating says the behaviour has become ""normalised""
""For years people have been coming here and what they're doing is groping Molly's breasts,"" said Dublin resident Clodagh Keating.
""It was normalised, people thought it was okay and now we've said just because something is normal in society, doesn't mean it's right.""
This group from New Jersey had mixed opinions on the matter
Among the tourists who spoke to the BBC, opinions were mixed.
One visitor from New Jersey told the BBC: ""I can see the vulgarity of it but it's just a tradition, it's just what you do, so you do it.â
Another added: ""It's fine. You're not taking her clothes off, you're touching an area of her body that's beloved.""
Cala and Seth from Minnesota 
Cala, from Minnesota, said: ""I think it's pretty rude that it's obviously been rubbed clear in one area.""
Seth, also from Minnesota, said: ""It's not the most respectful way to treat an historical figure.""
Tilly Cripwell wants to see the statue on a plinth
The stewards are in place at the Molly Malone statue until the end of this week only, at a cost of â¬350 (Â£298) per day, per steward.
Dublin City council says raising the sculpture on a plinth could cost upwards of â¬100,000 (Â£85,000), but that it is considering several options.
The statue was originally placed in Dublin's Grafton Street but was later moved
The Molly Malone statue was erected 37 years ago in tribute to a legendary Dublin woman who sold shellfish in the streets of the Irish capital.
It is not clear if the character is based on a real or fictional person, but the figure of Molly Malone has come to represent part of Dublin's working class community.
She was also the subject of a traditional folk song, which tells the story of a fishmonger's daughter who sold cockles and mussels from a wheelbarrow.
According to the colourful lyrics, Molly died of a fever but then returned as a ghost, still wheeling her wheelbarrow through the city's streets.
Many public artworks in Dublin are popularly referred to by rhyming nicknames, and for years the Molly Malone statue was known as ""the tart with the cart"".
This name was in part due to suggestions that Molly Malone worked as a fishmonger by day and as a sex worker by night.
The statue was first erected in Dublin's Grafton Street in 1988, created by the renowned bronze sculptor Jeanne Rynhart.
It was later moved to nearby St Andrews' Street to accommodate the construction of a tram line."

Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport briefly lost communications with planes under their control, ""unable to see, hear, or talk to them"" last week, officials say.
The 28 April incident led to multiple employees going on trauma leave,  contributing to hundreds of delayed flights. More than 150 flights were cancelled  on Monday alone, according to tracking website FlightAware. 
The airport, one of New York's busiest hubs, has been grappling with staff shortages for more than a week.
US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Monday that contact with air traffic was lost for ""30 seconds"", but it did not mean that the planes were going to crash.
""The primary communication line went down, the backup line didn't fire, and so for 30 seconds we lost contact with air traffic,"" Duffy told Fox News
""Now were planes going to crash? No. They have communication devices. ... But it's a sign that we have a frail system in place, and it has to be fixed.""
The Federal Aviation Administration also acknowledged in a statement  that ""our antiquated air traffic control system is affecting our work force"".
Confirming the controllers were on leave following the incident, the FAA said it could ""not quickly replace them"". 
""We continue to train controllers who will eventually be assigned to this busy airspace,"" the statement said. 
Air traffic control operations at the airport have come under sustained criticism recently.
Last week, United Airlines announced it was cancelling 35 flights per day from its Newark schedule because the airport ""cannot handle the number of planes that are scheduled to operate there"".
""In the past few days, on more than one occasion, technology that FAA air traffic controllers rely on to manage the airplanes coming in and out of Newark airport failed - resulting in dozens of diverted flights, hundreds of delayed and cancelled flights,"" United CEO Scott Kirby said.
He also said the issues were ""compounded"" because over 20% of FAA controllers ""walked off the job"". 
The National Air Traffic ControllersÂ Association said the employees took leave under provisions for workers who experience a traumatic event at work.
The union would not say how many controllers had taken leave, or how long they lost contact with planes.
The incident comes as the US Department of Transportation last week unveiled a package designed to boost the numbers of FAA air traffic controllers. The department said it was on track to hire at least 2,000 controllers this year.
In February, the Trump administration began firing hundreds of FAA employees, weeks after a fatal mid-air plane collision in Washington DC.
Transport secretary Duffy said he planned to unveil a plan on Thursday to seek billions of dollars from Congress to reform infrastructure and staffing. 
""We're going to build a brand new air traffic control system, from new telecom to new radars to new infrastructure,"" he told Fox News."

Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand its military offensive against Hamas which includes the ""capture"" of Gaza and the holding of its territory, according to an Israeli official.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet had decided on a ""forceful operation"" to destroy Hamas and rescue its remaining hostages, and that Gaza's 2.1 million population ""will be moved, to protect it"".
He did not say how much territory would be seized by troops, but he stressed that ""they will not enter and come out"".
The cabinet also approved, in principle, a plan to deliver aid through private companies, which would end a two-month blockade the UN says has caused severe food shortages.
The UN and other aid agencies have said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate.
A Hamas official said the group rejected Israel's ""pressure and blackmail"".
Asked about the Israeli plan to expand its offensive, President Donald Trump repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians there.
The UK meanwhile said it ""does not support an expansion of Israel's military operations in Gaza"". The EU earlier urged restraint, saying it was concerned about ""further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian population"".

Israel's security cabinet met on Sunday evening to discuss the Gaza offensive, which resumed when Israel ended a two-month ceasefire on 18 March.
An Israeli official who briefed the media on Monday morning said ministers voted unanimously to approve a plan proposed by the Israeli military's Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir to ""defeat Hamas in Gaza and return the hostages"".
""The plan will include, among other things, the capture of the Strip and holding the territories, moving the Gazan population south for its defence, denying Hamas the ability to distribute humanitarian supplies, and powerful attacks against Hamas,"" the official said.
Israeli media reported that first stage would include the seizure of additional areas of Gaza and the expansion of the Israeli-designated ""buffer zone"" running along the territory's borders. It would aim to give Israel additional leverage in negotiations with Hamas on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal.
Later, a senior Israeli security official said the plan would not be implemented until after US President Donald Trump's visit to the region between 13 and 16 May, providing what he called ""a window of opportunity"" to Hamas to agree a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. 
Trump will visit Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar on his trip. 
Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich meanwhile told a conference in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel was ""going to finally occupy the Gaza Strip"", according to Reuters news agency.
Israel occupied Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war along with the West Bank. It unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but the UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because it retained control of Gaza's shared border, airspace and shoreline.
In a briefing later on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the expanded campaign would displace most Palestinians in Gaza as air strikes and other military operations continued. 
However, critics say military action has failed to secure the return of the 59 remaining hostages - up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive - and have urged the government to strike a deal with Hamas.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents hostages' relatives, said the plan was an admission by the government that it was ""choosing territories over the hostages"" and that this was ""against the will of over 70% of the people"" in Israel.
Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi reiterated that the group wanted a comprehensive deal, including ""a complete ceasefire, full withdrawal from Gaza, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, and the release of all prisoners from both sides"".
Palestinians in north Gaza told the BBC that they were strongly opposed to being forcibly displaced to the south once again, with several saying they would rather die amid the ruins of their homes.
""In October 2023, I evacuated with my children, daughters, and grandchildren - about 60 people in total,"" 76-year-old Gaza City resident Ahmed Shehata said.
""We lived through unbearable conditions in what Israel claimed was a 'safe zone' in the south. This time, we will not leave, even if Israel brings down the tents over our heads.""
Osama Tawfiq, a 48-year-old father of five, said: ""Israeli threats won't scare us. We are staying in Gaza.""
Gaza's community kitchens say they are days away from running out of supplies
The Israeli official said the security cabinet also approved by a large majority ""the possibility of humanitarian [aid] distribution - if necessary - that would prevent Hamas from taking control of supplies and would destroy its governmental capabilities"".
The security official said deliveries would resume once the expanded offensive began, and that the military would establish a ""sterile area"" in the southern Rafah area that Palestinians would be able to enter pending inspection.
On Sunday, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), a forum that includes UN agencies, said Israeli officials were seeking to ""shut down the existing aid distribution system"" and ""have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military, once the government agrees to re-open crossings"".
The HCT warned that the plan would mean large parts of Gaza, including less mobile and most vulnerable people, would continue to go without supplies.
""It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic â as part of a military strategy,"" it said.
""It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.""
Israel cut off all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza aid on 2 March, two weeks before resuming its offensive.
According to the UN, the population is facing a renewed risk of hunger and malnutrition because warehouses are empty, bakeries have shut, and community kitchens are days away from running out of supplies.
The blockade has also cut off essential medicines, vaccines and medical equipment needed by Gaza's overwhelmed healthcare system.
The UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for Gaza's population, almost all of whom have been displaced. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no shortage of aid.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,567 people have been killed in Gaza since then, including 2,459 since the Israeli offensive resumed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Alcatraz - popularly known as ""the Rock"" - has not been used as a prison for decades. It is now a historic landmark visited by millions of tourists each year. 
The US president says he believes the prison could be used once again to house dangerous inmates, and to serve as a symbol of law and order in the US. 
But experts say that refurbishing the dilapidated remains of the once-formidable prison is ""not realistic at all"". Here's what we know about the plan. 
The price to keep prisoners at Alcatraz was significantly higher than elsewhere in the federal prison system. 
Located on an island about 1.25 miles (2km) offshore from San Francisco, Alcatraz  originally was built as a naval defence fort, but was rebuilt in the early 20th century as a military prison.
In 1934, it was formally converted into a federal prison - Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary - housing notorious inmates including gangster Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly, among others.
The prison was among one of the most notorious in the US at the time, and was considered inescapable because of the strong currents and frigid temperatures of San Francisco Bay.

Alcatraz 1962 escapees had small chance of success
The facility also was made famous by the 1979 American biographical prison movie, Escape from Alcatraz, which recounted a 1962 prisoner escape, starring Clint Eastwood as ringleader Frank Morris.
It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz Island.
A cell block at Alcatraz Island in San Francisco
According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, BOP, it was nearly three times more costly to operate than other federal institutions and was ultimately closed by Attorney General Robert Kennedy in 1963. 
The island and prison are now a museum operated by the National Park Service. More than 1.4m people visit each year. 
""Alcatraz is a place where the past meets the present,"" Christine Lehnertz, president and CEO of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, said in a statement sent to the BBC. 
 ""It challenges us to listen, to learn, and to carry forward the stories that still shape our world today,"" she added.  
Donald Trump is not the first president to mull re-opening the facility as a detention centre. 
In 1981, Alcatraz was one of 14 sites considered by the Reagan administration to hold up to 20,000 refugees who had fled from Cuba to Florida in the famous ""Mariel Boatlift"". 
The site eventually was rejected due to its value as a historical tourist site and its complete lack of adequate facilities.
Trump explains his idea to reopen Alcatraz
In a Truth Social post on 4 May, Trump first said he had directed his government to re-open and expand the island prison, saying that ""for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders"".
Speaking to reporters at the White House the following day, Trump said that, in his view, Alcatraz ""represents something very strong, very powerful"" - law and order. 
""We need law and order in this country,"" he said. ""So we're going to look at it. Some of the people up here are going to be working very hard on that."" 
While he said he finds the idea ""interesting"", Trump also acknowledged that the prison is currently a ""big hulk"" that is ""rusting and rotting"". 
""It sort of represents something that is both horrible and beautiful and strong and miserable,"" he said. 
Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, also told reporters that Alcatraz could be ""an option"" for ""significant public safety threats and national security threats"". 
""It should be on the table,"" he added. 
A cell at Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, California,
Soon after Trump's comments made news around the world, justice department spokesman Chad Gilmartin said in a statement that BOP ""is working towards rebuilding and opening Alcatraz to serve as a symbol of law and order"".
But prison experts and historians have expressed serious doubts whether the plan is feasible.
""To be frank, at first I thought it was a joke,"" Hugh Hurwitz, who served as acting director of the BOP between May 2018 and August 2019, told the BBC. ""It's not realistic to think you can repair it. You'd have to tear it up and start over.""
Mr Hurwitz pointed to a number of issues with the facility, including buildings that are ""literally falling apart"", and cells in which ""a six-foot person can't stand up"".
""There's no security upgrades. No cameras. No fencing,"" he added. ""You can't run a prison.""
""I have two words: water and sewage,"" said Jolene Babyak, an author and Alcatraz historian who lived there as a child during her father's two stints as prison administrator.
""In its heyday, all the sewage for 500 or more people was just dumped in the bay,"" she said. ""Nowadays it has to be boated off. It's just not realistic at all. But it captures everyone's imagination.""
When the facility closed in 1963, the BOP said it was nearly three times more expensive to operate Alcatraz than any other federal prison - the per-capita cost  being $10 and $13 per inmate, compared to between $3 and $5 at other facilities. This was in part because it required food and supplies to be dropped off by boat.
In today's federal prisons, the per capita cost for inmates is between $120 and $164 - meaning that costs could rise to over $500 per person in a facility like Alcatraz. 
Alcatraz could hold only about 340 prisoners at its peak.
""It was mind bogglingly expensive to keep a convict there,"" said John Martini, a historian who spent several years on Alcatraz as a ranger with the National Park Service. ""Things have not changed. But the place has gone downhill.""
""It's basically a shell. Even the concrete has major problems. The Park Service has put millions into structurally stabilising it,"" he added. ""They would need water, electricity, heat, and sanitation. None of those functions.""
""This [Trump's comments] are just another twist in the odd history of Alcatraz,"" Mr Martini added."

Israel's military says it has hit Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the group's missile launch at Israel's Ben Gurion airport the previous day.
The IDF said it attacked sites that it claimed served as a ""central supply source for the Houthis"" in the Hudaydah Port, as well as the Bajil cement factory east of the city of Hudaydah. 
Following Sunday's airport strike, the Houthis said they would impose ""a comprehensive aerial blockade"" on Israel by targeting airports in response to Israel's plans to expand operations in Gaza.
The Iran-backed group said 21 people were injured in Monday's attack, and described it as a joint raid of ""US-Israeli aggression"". The US denied involvement.
The IDF said its Monday strikes were ""conducted precisely, with measures taken to mitigate harm to vessels docked at the port"". 
It claimed the Bajil factory functioned as a ""significant economic resource"", and was used by the group to construct tunnels and infrastructure, while the port sites were used ""for the transfer of Iranian weapons"".
The port is the second-largest in the Red Sea after Aden, and is the entry point for about 80% of Yemen's food imports.
Multiple residents told Reuters news agency that more than 10 strikes targeted Hudaydah Port and the al-Salakhanah and al-Hawak areas in the city, while four more targeted the cement factory.
A spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry, Anees al-Asbahi, said at least 21 people were injured in the attack.
The Houthis blamed the US and Israel jointly for the attack. A US defence official told the AFP news agency that their forces ""did not participate in the Israeli strikes on Yemen today"".
The missile fired towards Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv on Sunday morning landed next to an access road near the main terminal. Four people were injured by the blast, with another two injured on their way to a shelter, Israeli emergency services said.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, threatened retaliation, saying: ""We attacked in the past, we will attack in the future.""
Iran said the airport attack was an ""independent decision"" by the Yemeni group.
The US has also been launching air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen. 
Former US president Joe Biden's administration approved US strikes on the Houthis, which have continued under Donald Trump, the current president.
Last month, the Houthis said at least 68 African migrants were killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in north-western Yemen."

GÃ©rald Darmanin admitted that security arrangements for the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid were wrong, and that his first public remarks â blaming English fans â were a mistake.
""It was a failure because I had not foreseen.  That was a mistake on my part. I was led astray by my preconceptions,"" said Darmanin, now France's justice minister.
""The scapegoat was easy to find, and I apologise now to Liverpool supporters. They were quite right to be hurt. It was a mistake and a failure.""
GÃ©rald Darmanin admitted it was a ""mistake"" to point the finger at Liverpool fans for the security breakdown at the 2022 final
Police used tear gas on Liverpool supporters as they tried to enter the stadium in Paris. Some fans were also ambushed and mugged by gangs of French youths. 
In a lengthy interview on the Legend YouTube channel, Darmanin said the night was ""the biggest failure"" of his career.
""What I did not appreciate that evening was that the real problem was not coming from English supporters, but from delinquents who were robbing fans.
Liverpool fans' claim 'can be heard in England'
""Our security arrangements were not designed for that eventuality.  We had riot police â¦ with big boots and shields â not great for running. What you need against that kind of delinquency is officers in running shoes.
""We got our arrangements wrong.  We were expecting a war of (football) hooligans, and what we got instead was muggers.""
In their first comments after the problems, Darmanin and police chief Didier Lallement said the dangerous crush at the stadium was largely caused by Liverpool fans in possession of fake tickets. 
The claim was subsequently debunked in an independent report commissioned by UEFA.
Liverpool fans were initially accused of causing the chaotic scenes at the Stade de France in 2022
In another section of the interview, Darmanin said that there was ""no longer any safe place"" in France - a comment that drew fire from the hard-right opposition.
""What a lot of French people can see is that (violence) has become general, it has metastasised.  It's no longer only in the places where you once looked for potential problems.
""Nowadays you can see that the tiniest country village has experience of cocaine or cannabis.""
National Rally MP Jean-Philippe Tanguy noted that Darmanin has been in government since President Emmanuel Macron's first election in 2017.
Tungay said he was ""treating the French like imbeciles, making all these so-called tough declarations when the record is so catastrophic"".
Darmanin, who is 42 and from the political right, did nothing in the interview to dispel speculation that he might be in the running to replace Macron in 2027.
""Do I think of the presidential election? The answer is yes,"" he said. 
""That does not mean that I am going to be a candidate, but it does mean I have ambitions for the country to do better than what I see now."""

Hundreds of opposition protesters dressed in red and black have condemned a decision by Ghana's president to suspend the country's chief justice, and are demanding that she be reinstated with immediate effect.
They accuse President John Mahama of violating the constitution by failing to follow due process, and say he is interfering in the independence of the judiciary.
Gertrude Torkornoo was removed from her post last week pending investigations into her conduct - the first time a chief justice has been suspended in Ghana's history.
Action was taken after the president said three people had sent petitions to him containing undisclosed allegations against Chief Justice Torkornoo.
Monday's demonstration in Accra was led by the main opposition New Patriotic Party (NPP), who were in power when Chief Justice Torkornoo was appointed by then-president Nana Akufo-Addo two years ago.
The NPP's national organiser Nana Boakye Yiadom told the BBC her treatment was politically motivated and an attack on democracy.
Also taking part in the protests were three smaller opposition groups.
The opposition's demands echo those made by the Ghana Bar Association last week. The grouping of top legal professionals said suspending the chief justice  was unconstitutional and President Mahama must reverse it.
But that view is not shared by all. 
A number of lawyers in the country argue it is within the president's power to act when there is evidence of misconduct by a public officer, no matter the position. This view is also backed by the president's supporters.
By law, chief justices in Ghana enjoy security of tenure, which means that they remain in office until retirement. 
Yet Ghana's constitution does empower the president to appoint, suspend or even fire the chief justice where there is evidence of wrongdoing, including incompetence and misbehaviour. However some Ghanaians argue due process has not been followed in this instance.
One protester, Serwaa Akoto, told the BBC: ""The judiciary is under attack and we want the right thing to be done. Why is he suspending the chief justice?""
Serwaa Akoto, who was at the protest in Accra, says the judiciary is under attack
Also at the protest was Charles Oteng, who told the BBC: ""We want to send a strong signal to the president. Yes, indeed, he has all the powers as a president, but the way he is attacking our judiciary is very alarming - and we the youth will not sit for him to do whatever he wants to do."" 
Chief Justice Torkornoo is the third woman to hold the position in Ghana. Since winning power, Mahama's National Democratic Congress has stepped up accusations of bias in her rulings of high profile political cases, which she denies.
She is expected to be summoned to answer questions in person in front of a committee investigating the allegations against her.

A bodyguard for one of Uganda's opposition leaders, Bobi Wine, has been charged with aggravated robbery, days after the head of the military said he had detained him. 
Last week Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also President Yoweri Museveni's son, confirmed that he had been holding Eddie Mutwe five days after his disappearance. 
The lawyer representing the bodyguard, whose real name is Edward Sebuufu, said his client had been tortured, telling the country's Daily Monitor newspaper, external that he was beaten using ""wires of electricity"".
Magellan Kazibwe added that Mr Sebuufu was in ""great pain"" and had also faced the squeezing of his ""private parts"".
Mr Kazibwe told reporters that Mr Sebuufu had faced electrocution and that his team were planning to take him to hospital.
Rights groups have long accused the authorities of targeting the opposition especially during the run up to elections.
As Mr Sebuufu was brought to court on Monday, security operatives tried to shield him to prevent the media from seeing him.  
But videos showed Bobi Wine's bodyguard barefoot, and hardly able to walk.
Last week, Gen Kainerugaba posted on social media that Mr Sebuufu was in his custody. The army chief said the bodyguard had been shaved and that he planned to castrate him. 
The detention comes as Uganda gears up for elections in 2026 where Museveni, who has been in power for nearly four decades, is expected to run against Bobi Wine. 
Several human rights activists have condemned Mr Sebuufuu's detention, meanwhile Uganda's Human Rights Commission called for his immediate release.
Civil society organisations have also warned that his detention is part of a systematic campaign to silence dissent and crush opposition ahead of the general election.
However, the government blames the opposition for civilian and police clashes, saying they hold rallies without permission. 
Lawyer Mr Kazibwe added that aside from aggravated robbery, Mr Sebuufu was also charged with simple robbery over an alleged incident in Lwengo District.

The UN's top court has dismissed Sudan's case against the UAE accusing the Gulf state of complicity in genocide.
Sudan alleged the UAE supported the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the Sudanese civil war, in which tens of thousands of people have died, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine.
The UAE categorically denied the accusations, branding the case ""political theatre"" and ""a cynical publicity stunt"".
The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the case could not proceed because the UAE had opted out Article 9 of the Genocide Convention, which means that it cannot be sued by other states over genocide allegations.

The court said that it lacked jurisdiction and was therefore ""precluded by its statute from taking any position on the merits of the claims made by Sudan"". The case was thrown out in a 14-2 vote.
Sudan case had claimed that the UAE's alleged military, financial and logistical backing of the RSF - including weapons shipments and mercenary recruitment - enabled systematic attacks against non-Arab communities, particularly the Masalit, in Darfur.
The allegations included mass killings, forced displacement and the use of sexual violence as a weapon.
Reem Ketait, the UAE's deputy assistant minister for political affairs, said the court's decision was ""clear and decisive"".
""The international community must focus urgently on ending this devastating war and supporting the Sudanese people, and it must demand humanitarian aid reaches all those in need,"" she said. 
Both the Sudanese army and the RSF have been accused of committing atrocities, including ethnically targeted killings, obstruction of humanitarian relief and looting.
Sudan's case at the ICJ was unusual because it targeted an alleged sponsor of atrocities, not the direct perpetrators.
The case was seen as a test of whether states can be held responsible for fuelling atrocities abroad. 
While the ICJ's judges found they did not have the power to rule in the case, it nevertheless serves as a powerful illustration of how international courts are becoming diplomatic battlegrounds.

Pence defied Trump by declining to throw out electoral votes cast for Joe Biden during a congressional session on 6 January 2021 that was targeted by rioters.
The former vice-president stayed inside the US Capitol as it was stormed by hundreds of Trump supporters and presided over the certification of the election after the building was cleared.

The US vice-president presides over the Senate, and it was in this role that Pence resisted calls from Trump and his supporters to try to overturn the election results.
Although there was no evidence to back up Trump's allegations, his supporters sought to stop the certification of the election, usually a routine procedure, on 6 January 2021.
Trump publicly criticised Pence and called on him to stop the certification process. Some of the Capitol rioters chanted ""hang Mike Pence"" as they breached security.
Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 vote later led to criminal cases against him and his supporters..
After he was inaugurated for a second time, Trump pardoned or commuted the sentences of everyone charged or convicted in connection with the Capitol riot â more than 1,500 people in total.

President Kennedy published his book Profiles in Courage in 1957. It included short profiles of eight US Senators who took principled stands and suffered criticism and falling popularity as a result.
The Kennedy family established the award named after the book in 1989.
In announcing the award last month, the JFK Library Foundation praised Pence ""for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021"".
In a statement, the former vice-president said he was ""deeply humbled and honoured"".
Since leaving office, Pence has been largely shunned by Trump and the Republican Party. His own run for president in 2024 drew tepid support and ended months before Republican primaries began.
He has set up a conservative political action group, Advancing American Freedom, which criticises what it calls the ""radical Left and liberal media"" and has also campaigned against the nomination of Robert F Kennedy Jr as US Health Secretary."

Four Kenyan police officers have been charged with the murder of a six-month-old baby nearly eight years ago.
Eight other officers who had originally also been accused alongside the four have had the charges against them dropped by the public prosecutor, sparking criticism.
The case relates to baby Samatha Pendo, who was fatally hit in 2017 as police were deployed to quell violence linked to post-election protests in the western city of Kisumu.
On Monday, the four officers who are still accused denied multiple charges including murder as a crime against humanity.
They also pleaded not guilty to other charges of torture and rape committed against civilians.
But a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, say the charge sheet ""omits senior officers who held overall command responsibility during the operations that saw the deaths, rape and injuries of no less than 60 Kenyans"".
They have also expressed concern over the prosecutor's office move to name the victims and witnesses which it said could expose them to harm and reprisals.
Baby Pendo - as she became known - died after being hit on the head, which caused a national outrage and became a symbol of the police brutality during the 2017 unrest.
The public prosecutor at the time initiated a public inquest.
After the inquest found the police culpable, the prosecutor ordered further investigations into other cases resulting from the police operation.
But none of the accused had until now entered a plea amid repeated delays in court, which sparked calls for justice and accountability.
Baby Pendo's mum, Lensa Achieng, has told the BBC that she is hopeful for justice and is pleased that ""we have a case now"".
She said the journey had not been easy ""but as the family of Baby Pendo at least we are going somewhere... they are taking a bold step to take the case to another level.
""It's just our prayer for us to find justice for our daughter so that whatever happened to us does not happen to another parent.""
Rights groups have continued to criticise the delays, blaming numerous attempts to defer or stall court proceedings.
They say the charges were amended without the involvement of the investigating agency, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa). 
Ipoa has said it does not know the rationale used by the prosecutor.
There has been little movement since a new prosecutor took over in 2023, and this year the head of Amnesty Kenya, Irungu Houghton, told the BBC that there seemed to be ""an unwillingness to try to prosecute this case"".
Amnesty and other rights groups are now calling on the judiciary to ensure the cases against the four officers are not delayed.

Rwanda is in the ""early stage"" of talks with the Trump administration to accept migrants deported by the US, the East African country's Foreign Affairs Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe has said.
His comments come after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that Washington was ""actively searching"" for countries that would take in ""some of the most despicable human beings"".
Nduhungirehe said the talks were ""not new to us"" as Rwanda had previously agreed to accept migrants deported by the UK. 
However, the UK abandoned the scheme, which faced numerous legal challenges, after Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government took office last July. 
Speaking to Rwandan TV on Sunday, Nduhungirehe said the government was in the ""spirit"" of giving ""another chance to migrants who have problems across the world"". 
Nduhungirehe added that the talks with the US were continuing, and it was too early to predict their outcome. 
Since coming to office in January, US President Donald Trump has focused on speeding up the removal of undocumented migrants, with the promise of ""mass deportations"".
In February, El Salvador offered to take in criminals deported from the US, including those with US citizenship, and house them in its mega-jail.
Salvadorean President Nayib Bukele said his government would do so ""in exchange for a fee"". 
Panama and Costa Rica have also taken in migrants deported from the US. 
Last week an unnamed Rwandan official told the Washington Post , externalthat the country was ""open"" to taking in more migrants expelled from the US, after having accepted an Iraqi in March. 
The official added that talks with the US started shortly after Trump's inauguration in January. 
Rwanda has previously been criticised for its human rights record, including the risk that those sent to the East African nation could be deported again to countries where they may face danger.
However, Rwanda says it is a safe place for refugees.

Prosecutors in Mexico have arrested the mayor of TeuchitlÃ¡n in western Jalisco state as part of their investigation into a nearby cartel training site. 
The mayor, JosÃ© MurguÃ­a Santiago, is suspected of colluding with the New Generation Jalisco Cartel (CJNG), which he has denied. 
The investigation was launched after activists discovered bone fragments and hundreds of discarded shoes, backpacks and items of clothing at the Izaguirre ranch outside the town in March. 
Rights groups said that they feared the ranch had been used as an ""extermination camp"", where people were forcedly recruited and trained, and those who refused were tortured and killed.
The discovery by people searching for their missing relatives of what appeared to be evidence of mass killings at the site shocked the country, where cartel violence is rife. 
Read: Ovens and bone fragments - BBC visits Mexican cartel 'extermination' site
Mexico's Attorney-General Alejandro Gertz gave a news conference last week updating journalists on the federal investigation into the ranch.
He confirmed that the site had been used as a training centre for recruits of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of the most feared and powerful transnational drug trafficking gangs, which has its power base in Jalisco. 
However, he said that there was no evidence that it had been used as an extermination and cremation site.
According to the attorney-general, bone fragments discovered there were not recent and forensic tests suggested that the fires lit at the ranch would not have been hot enough to dispose of human remains. 
Gertz's statements caused anger among ""searchers"", the name given to relatives looking for the more than 120,000 people who have been reported missing in Mexico over the past two decades.
Activists searching for missing relatives said they want a ""real"" investigation into what happened at the ranch
They said that his news conference raised more questions than it answered and failed to address to whom the many abandoned shoes found at the ranch belonged and what had become of those people. 
Gertz insisted that the authorities would continue looking into whether there had been any collusion between the CJNG and local officials.
The arrest of Mayor MurguÃ­a Santiago is part of that ongoing investigation. 
Prior to his arrest, the mayor had said that he had nothing to hide. ""If they want to investigate me, let them, I'm clean and willing to say what I know,"" he told local media.
But prosecutors allege that he knew of the existence of the training centre and did not act on that knowledge."

One of Francis' popemobiles, which the late pontiff used to greet thousands of people, will be turned into a mobile health clinic to help the children of Gaza.
Following a request by Pope Francis, the vehicle used during his visit to Bethlehem in 2014 is being refitted with everything needed for frontline care in a war zone, charity organisation Caritas, which is overseeing the project, said.
""There'll be rapid tests, suture kits, syringes, oxygen supplies, vaccines and a small fridge for storing medicines,"" it explained in a statement.
The Vatican said it was the pope's ""final wish for the children of Gaza"" before he died  last month. The vehicle is currently in Bethlehem, and will enter Gaza if and when Israel opens a humanitarian corridor.
The war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 15,000 children and displaced nearly one million since it erupted in October 2023, Unicef reports. 
Israel has blocked humanitarian aid from entering the Strip for more than two months, which has left ""families struggling to survive"" as food, clean water and medicines reach critically low levels, the UN agency for children said.
For now, Caritas will have to wait until Israel reopens the aid corridor - but when that happens, they say they will be ready.
""With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to health care â children who are injured and malnourished,"" Peter Brune, Secretary General of Caritas Sweden, said in a statement.
A team of doctors will run the mobile clinic, which will have the capabilities to examine and treat patients, and there will be a dedicated driver. Some details are still being finalised, like how to make the vehicle safe from potential blasts, Mr Brune told the BBC.
""It's not just a vehicle, it's a message that the world has not forgotten about the children in Gaza,"" he said.
Throughout his pontificate, Pope Francis made many impassioned remarks on the war in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Strip ""shamefull"". During his final speech on Easter Sunday, he urged all ""warring parties"" to agree to a ceasefire and spoke of the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis. 
During 18 months of war, he reportedly called parishioners in Gaza nightly to check on their wellbeing, and suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide â an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.
The popemobile that Francis used during his visit to Bethlehem in 2014 is being repurposed into a mobile health clinic
The popemobile is one of a number of specially converted vehicles allowing the pontiff to greet huge crowds of well-wishers during official visits. He was able to sit or stand while it rolled along, flanked by security agents, and its design allowed those gathered to have a clear view of the Pope. 
Popemobiles in the past were bullet-proof after an assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II in 1981, but Francis told Spanish media in 2014 that he didn't like the glass ""sardine can"" design that separated him from people.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages.
Israel's military campaign has killed at least 52,243 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.
On Monday, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved, in principle, a plan to resume deliveries and distribution of humanitarian aid through private companies, but the UN and other aid agencies said the proposal would be a breach of basic humanitarian principles and that they will not co-operate."

The Kenyan government has described as ""shameful"" an incident in which a shoe was thrown at President William Ruto during a rally on Sunday.
Widely shared video clips show the footwear striking the president's left arm as he held it aloft while he was speaking.
Government spokesman Isaac Mwaura condemned what happened and called for those behind it to be ""apprehended"". ""What would happen if we all decided to throw shoes at each other? What values are we teaching our children?"" he asked in post on X, external calling for the institution of the presidency to be respected.
Kenyan media are reporting that three people have been arrested, but the police have not confirmed this.
Some MPs have also criticised the shoe-throwing, which has been described as a major security lapse.
Dennis Itumbi, a senior official in the president's office, has described the incident as a ""moment that got out of hand"" suggesting that it happened by accident.
On Facebook, he shared a video taken from a different angle, which he said showed a person lifting a shoe ""in jest, pretending to be a camera"" and another person slapping it away, ""annoyed that the 'shoe-cam' blocked his view"".
""Unfortunately, it flew forwardâ¦ straight toward the president,"" he said.
The president was addressing a crowd at a public event in the western county of Migori as part of a three-day tour of the region where he has been launching and commissioning development projects.
While the views of some ordinary Kenyans chime with the feeling that the shoe-throwing was disrespectful, others have suggested that it reflected frustrations over the state of the economy.
An official video of the event shared by the president on X does not show the shoe incident, which appears to have happened off-camera.
However, commotion within the crowd is briefly seen. The president is heard asking his security officers, who may have been about to look for the culprit, to leave the people in the audience alone.
The screen then goes blank before and minutes later the video shows other people speaking at the rally.
The shoe-throwing comes amid growing concerns over the safety of public officials. Last week, an opposition MP was shot dead in the capital, Nairobi, by gunmen on a motorcycle in a suspected assassination.
Nelson Koech, an MP in the president's party, said Sunday's incident was an ""affront to our democracy"" adding that ""we have taken a joke too far"".
""You can imagine if that shoe was a bullet... people joke about the security of the president. It took a very bold step for someone to take their shoe and throw it at the president.
""We must secure the head of state,"" he told local station Citizen TV.
Migori is in a region considered to be a stronghold of veteran opposition politician Raila Odinga, who ran against Ruto in the 2022 presidential election, but who has since made a deal with the president.
The agreement signed in March between Odinga and Ruto was ""to help ease the prevailing tension in the country"", following deadly anti-tax demonstrations last year.
Since he became president in 2022, Ruto has faced protests from Kenyans frustrated with the cost of living and increased taxes.

687,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0qnvnxn0y7o,2025-05-05 10:33:57,"Left for dead again: Ancient Indian skeleton still waiting for permanent address,","The skeleton has been placed inside a makeshift tent for now
A 1,000 year-old human skeleton buried sitting cross-legged in India is still without a museum to house it because of bureaucratic wrangling, six years after it was unearthed.
Archaeologist Abhijit Ambekar made the significant discovery in 2019, when he spotted what looked like the top of a human skull while excavating in western Gujarat state.
As his team dug deeper, they found the well-preserved remains in a pit in what appeared to be a meditative posture. Similar remains have been found at only three other sites in India.
But officials are still arguing over who should take charge of the skeleton. It remains in a makeshift shelter â not far from a new museum of local archaeology.
Abhijit Ambekar (right) brushing soil off the skeleton
Abhijit Ambekar says the skeleton - found in the town of Vadnagar - is likely to belong to the Solanki period. The Solanki dynasty, also known as the Chaulukya dynasty, ruled over parts of modern-day Gujarat between 940 to 1300 CE.
The skeleton's right arm rested on its lap and its left arm lay suspended in the air, as if resting on a stick.
""The skeleton is an extremely valuable find, not just for Vadnagar but for the whole country. It can help us understand how our ancestors lived, and reveal details about the past that are yet unknown,"" says Dr Ambekar, who heads the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) division in Mumbai, and led the team that found the skeleton.
That it is yet to find a proper resting place, despite its archaeological significance, appears to come down to red tape.
Mr Ambekar says the Gujarat government's plan for all artefacts excavated from Vadnagar was to place them in local museums.
He says around 9,000 artefacts, including the skeleton, that were excavated from Vadnagar between 2016 and 2022 by the ASI and had been handed over to the Gujarat government have been placed in local museums - except for the skeleton.
However, the state government says the skeleton is still in the possession of the ASI.
""As proper process was not followed, it [the skeleton] was not placed in the museum,"" Pankaj Sharma, director of the state's Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, told the BBC.
Yadubir Singh Rawat, director general of the ASI, did not respond to the BBC's questions on the matter.
M Thennarasan, principal secretary of the state's Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities Department told the BBC, that authorities were working on shifting the skeleton to a museum as soon as possible.
The skeleton was coated with materials to protect it
Excavating the skeleton was a time-consuming process, Mr Ambekar says, adding that it took two months to complete. Various tools were used to carefully brush the soil away and free the skeleton from its ancient grave.
It is currently housed in a tarpaulin shelter in Vadnagar, unprotected by security guards and exposed to natural elements. Locals sometimes bring relatives and friends to see the skeleton - a curiosity that has put a spotlight on the town, which is also the birthplace of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
What's interesting is that just a short distance away is the new Archaeological Experiential Museum - inaugurated by India's home minister in January.
According to a government press release, the museum has been built at a cost of $35m and is spread across 12,500 sq m. It boasts that it showcases ""Vadnagar's 2,500-year-old history with over 5,000 artefacts, including ceramics, coins, tools and skeletal remains"".
While the museum has a massive framed photo of the skeleton, it does not house the actual remains.
Vadnagar is a historically significant region in Gujarat and excavations by the ASI have found traces of human settlements dating back to more than 2,000 years ago. Mr Ambekar says that portions of an earthen rampart believed to have been built by the region's first settlers exists even today.
Digs have also revealed remnants of ancient Buddhist monasteries and stupas. These findings and others â such as terracotta figurines, coins, shell jewellery and stone and copper plate inscriptions - have helped archaeologists establish seven cultural sequences or phases in the area, starting from around the 2nd Century BCE and dating all the way up to the 19th Century CE.
Mr Ambekar says the age of the skeleton he and his team found was estimated based on a DNA analysis of its teeth and a stratigraphic study of the excavation site. Stratigraphy involves studying rock sediments or layers of earth to determine their age. This is then used to establish the chronology of historical events or the approximate age of artefacts.
""The DNA analysis tells us that the skeleton is of local ancestry and belongs to a man in his forties, but more studies need to be done to understand his diet and lifestyle, which will in turn give us a better understanding of the region as it existed 1,000 years ago,"" he says.
A crane was used to transport the wooden box containing the skeleton to its present site
It could also shed light on the phenomenon of ""samadhi burials"" - an ancient burial practice among Hindus where revered figures were buried instead of being cremated, Mr Ambekar says.
He adds that the skeleton had managed to survive the passage of time because the soil around it had remained undisturbed and displayed characteristics that prevent skeletal decay.
Extricating the skeleton from the site and moving it to its current location was not an easy task. First, a block of earth with the skeleton nestled inside was cut out from the soil surrounding it. The skeleton and soil were treated with different chemicals to consolidate their structures. The block of earth was then put into a wooden box filled with wet mud and a crane was used to move the box to its current site.
The entire operation took six days to complete, says Mr Ambekar.
The site where the skeleton was discovered
He hopes that the skeleton will find a place in a museum soon. But he adds it will need to have mechanisms to control the temperature and humidity of the space to prevent the skeleton from decomposing.
Locals the BBC spoke to expressed similar sentiments and blamed ""red tapeism"" for the back-and-forth over the skeleton.
""We are proud of Vadnagar's ancient history but this treatment of a 1,000-year-old skeleton is deeply concerning. What is the point of building a museum if the most unique antiquity is left outside under a plastic roof?"" Vadnagar resident Jesang Thakor said.
Another resident, Bethaji Thakor, said that he believed the skeleton could draw tourists from around the world to Vadnagar.
""Where else will you get to see something like this?"""

A right-wing nationalist candidate who is against providing military support for Ukraine and is sceptical about the EU has won a resounding victory in the first round of the presidential election in Romania. 
George Simion came first with 40.96% of the vote, and will go into the runoff on 18 May as the clear favourite against the liberal mayor of Bucharest.
Nicusor Dan narrowly beat Crin Antonescu, candidate of the governing coalition, with just under 21% of the vote.
Six months ago, the presidential election in Romania ended in scandal and confusion. It was won by a radical outsider with mystical leanings, Calin Georgescu, but that result was annulled over allegations of campaign fraud and Russian interference.
After the polls closed on Sunday, Simion thanked those who voted for him. ""It was an act of courage, trust and solidarity,"" he said in a recorded message.
""This election is not about one candidate or another, but about every Romanian who has been lied to, ignored, humiliated, and still has the strength to believe and defend our identity and rights,"" Simion posted on X on Friday. 
Simion's support was especially strong in the Romanian diaspora. He secured more than 70% of votes in Italy, Spain and Germany where Romanians largely do blue-collar work. 
Simion, 38, is an admirer of US President Donald Trump and says he wants an EU of strong, sovereign nations. 
He told the BBC he believed in a strong Nato and was in favour of keeping Nato bases and US troops in Romania, if he becomes president. 
However, he hinted he believed Nato had been too pro-active in its support of Ukraine.
Many of the voters who backed Georgescu in the annulled election last year are thought to have switched their allegiance to Simion, and the two men voted together on Sunday.
Simion won in Romania and among voters in the diaspora too
In the second round, Simion could also attract voters who backed fourth-placed former prime minister Victor Ponta, a former Social Democrat who adopted a ""Romania First"" campaign.
Simion, who leads the nationalist Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, calls for restoring Romania's old borders and has been banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine.
Asked how he would describe himself, Simion told the BBC: ""I am young and restless. I am a Romanian patriot [who] all his life... dreamt of being part of the free world, and now we discovered that the free world is not that free anymore.""
In February, US Vice-President JD Vance sharply criticised Romania for the annulment of the poll, sending shockwaves through a Romanian political establishment that leans heavily on its special relationship with the US. Georgescu was nevertheless barred from taking part in the rerun.
A potential Simion victory on 18 May is awaited nervously in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv and Moscow. 
Calin Georgescu looks on (L) as George Simion votes
Romania is an important transit route for weapon systems and ammunition to Ukraine. 
Last September it gave one of its two Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine. Romania has a US missile defence shield at Deveselu, and three major airbases from which Nato flies air policing missions and surveillance drones up to the border of Ukraine and Moldova, and out over the Black Sea. 
Ukraine exported 70% of its grain down the Black Sea coast in 2023, through Romanian territorial waters, towards Istanbul. The Romanian navy demines those waters, and the Romanian air force trains Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s. The Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania. A visa-waiver agreement was abruptly cancelled on the eve of the election.
""Forget about any more help to Ukraine if Simion becomes president,"" George Scutaru, a security expert at the New Strategy Center in Bucharest, said. 
As head of the National Security Council, the president can veto any decision, and has a strong influence on security policy. But Scutaru expresses ""prudent optimism"" that one of the centrists will win the run-off.
Simion made it clear to the BBC he felt that ""Russia is the biggest danger towards Romania, Poland and the Baltic states, the problem is this war is not going anywhere"". 
He said he hoped the peace talks organised by the Trump administration would result in a ceasefire and peace negotiations.
Public resentment at Romanian financial support for Ukrainian refugees has been a central plank in Simion's campaign, though he denies he is pro-Russian.
Good relations with Kyiv in future, he said, would depend on Ukrainian treatment of the Romanian minority in Ukraine and on Romanian churches and schools there.
During the weekend, crowds of sightseers thronged the gardens of the Cotroceni Palace, the presidential residence in the west of Bucharest. The decision by interim President Ilie Bolojan to open the buildings and gardens to the public from Friday to Sunday was very popular among visitors. 
The palace is a former monastery, converted in the 17th Century, which became home to the Romanian royal family in the 19th Century.
""I can't really imagine Simion in here,"" Ionut, a satirical writer, told me beside an ornate waterfall, looking up at the palace walls. 
He voted for Simion in the first round of the election last November, out of anger at the constant delays to Romania's full membership of the Schengen free-travel zone. And frustration with Romania's outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis. 
But Romania finally joined the Schengen land-borders on 1 January, and Iohannis stepped aside the same month.
""Romanians are less angry now,"" he believes. He voted for Nicusor Dan on Sunday.
Ana, a management consultant, walking with her family through the palace gardens, also supported Nicusor Dan. 
""I want to vote for both continuity and change,"" she says. ""Continuity in Romania's relationship with Europe, but change as far as corruption is concerned. We young people don't relate to the old parties any more.""

Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. 
In a message on his Truth Social site on Sunday, President Trump said that ""for too long America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat criminal offenders"".
The reopening of Alcatraz - once notorious as one of the US's toughest prisons - would serve as a ""symbol of law, order, and justice,"" he said. 
Leading Democrats said the proposal was ""not a serious one"". The maximum security facility, also known as The Rock, was closed in 1963 and it is currently operating as a successful tourist site.
""Today, I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ,"" Trump wrote.
The prison would ""house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders"".
President Trump has been clashing with the courts over his policy of sending alleged gang members to a prison in El Salvador. In March, he sent a group of more than 200 alleged Venezuelan gang members there. He has also talked about sending ""homegrown criminals"" to foreign prisons. 
Alcatraz was originally a naval defence fort, and it was rebuilt in the early 20th Century as a military prison. The Department of Justice took it over in the 1930s and it began taking in convicts from the federal prison system. Among its more famous inmates were the notorious gangsters Al Capone, Mickey Cohen and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly. 
The prison was also made famous by the 1962 film, Birdman of Alcatraz, starring Burt Lancaster, about the convicted murderer Robert Stroud, who while serving a life sentence on the prison island developed an interest in birds and went on to become an expert ornithologist. 
In 1979, the American biographical prison drama Escape from Alcatraz recounted a 1962 prisoner escape with Clint Eastwood starring as ringleader Frank Morris.
It was also the site of the 1996 film The Rock, starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage, about a former SAS captain and FBI chemist who rescue hostages from Alcatraz island.

The prison closed because it was too expensive to continue operating, according to the Federal Bureau of Prison website. It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, largely due to its island location. 
It would take an enormous amount of money to make Alcatraz into a functioning prison, Professor Gabriel Jack Chin from the Davis School of Law at the University of California told the BBC.  
The federal prison system is actually down about 25% from its peak population and ""there are a lot of empty beds"" in existing prisons, Chin said. ""So its not clear if a new one is needed.""
Alcatraz has ""a reputation as a tough prison"" and Trump is trying to send a message that his administration will be tough on crime, Chin added. 
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes Alcatraz, said the proposal was ""not a serious one,""  while the Democratic state senator for San Francisco, Scott Wiener, called the idea ""deeply unhinged"" in a post on Instagram and ""an attack on the rule of law.""

At least 10 people have died and 70 have been hospitalised after strong winds caused four tourist boats to capsize in southwestern China.
Sudden strong winds caused the boats to capsize in a river in Qianxi city in Guizhou on Sunday, leading 84 people to fall into the water, according to state media reports. The death toll jumped from nine after the body of one missing person was found on Monday. 
The incident occurred as China celebrated the tail end of its week-long May Day holiday, a peak season for travel. 
Chinese leader Xi Jinping had earlier urged ""all-out efforts"" in the search and rescue.
President Xi noted that other similar accidents had taken place recently, and stressed the importance of strengthening safety measures, state media said.
Authorities in China have also been told to step up public safety measures over peak tourist season.
Sunday's incident comes just two months after 11 people were killed in another  accident, when a passenger boat struck an industrial vessel in China's Hunan province. 
Another accident occurred over the weekend in the eastern city of Suzhou, after a sightseeing helicopter crashed in a newly-opened park, killing one person and injuring four on board."

Two women are due to launch a second attempt to row across the Pacific Ocean later, weeks after having to turn back when their boat broke.
Miriam Payne, 25, from Market Weighton in East Yorkshire, and Jess Rowe, 28, from Hampshire, initially set off from Peru on Tuesday 8 April.
But they had to be rescued about 350 miles from the coast of Lima, after a wave caused ""catastrophic damage"" to their rudder.
The pair, who call their team ""Seas the Day"", said they now faced a ""race against time"" to resume the 8,000-mile (12,875km) journey to Australia before the start of cyclone season.
Miss Payne said: ""We're just absolutely determined to make it happen. We just want to get back out there again.""
Following the breakdown, it took eight days for a Peruvian sailor, Alec Hughes, to tow the rowing boat back to Lima. 
A set of specialist replacement rudders were crafted by a boat yard in Norfolk and flown out to the team. 
This time, they will take four spare rudders with them on the boat. 
Miss Rowe said they had been ""totally blown away"" by the help they had received.

Cardinals from 71 different nationalities are gathering later this week to vote for the new pope in the Sistine Chapel following the death of Pope Francis.
Many people from those countries worship in the pews of Roman Catholic churches in the north-west of England, the region outside of London with the greatest number of Catholic residents.
So how are they are feeling about the forthcoming selection and are they looking for someone from their own nation to become the next pope?
Akwasi Atuah says an African pope would even inspire those who are not Catholic
Akwasi Atuah, 46, from Ghana, has high hopes the conclave might choose someone like Vatican-based Cardinal Peter Turkson, 76, one of the men mentioned as a possible first African pope of the modern era. 
The Salford-based IT Manager, who is a stalwart of the city's Catholic cathedral parish and has lived in the UK for 36 years, said: ""Ghanaians are very patriotic people, proud of any achievements of our fellow nationals around the world.
""We have a strong Christian population, and our Catholic members would love to see Cardinal Turkson as Pope.
""I think the idea of an African pope would be inspirational for all Catholics, and many non-Catholic Africans around the world.""
Father Solomon Shamee says the new pope's nationality is not relevant to him
Fellow west African Father Solomon Shamee, 41, is less sure of the need for an African pontiff.
Father Shamee, 40, who came to the UK in 2021 to be chaplain to the Manchester Nigerian chaplaincy and coordinator of refugee charity, Revive, said: ""I don't think a Nigerian pope is realistic.""
Now working in Chester, where his religious order the Holy Ghost Fathers, have their headquarters, he added: ""I don't feel we should be talking about the next Pope on the grounds of race and nationality.
""We should just pray for a pope that would guide the Church as Jesus desires.""
The conclave, which traditionally starts after a two-week mourning period, sees the College of Cardinals gather in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel on Thursday to cast a series of votes to choose the next pope.
Theoretically, any baptised man can be elected as pope, but a cardinal is usually picked.
The new pope has an invite to Manchester's Italian procession in July
The election of the Polish Pope John Paul II in 1978 broke a run of 455 years of Italian popes followed by German and Italian-Argentinian successors.
So are Italians in the North West hoping the cardinals will revert to one with Italian heritage?
Lorraine Taurasi, 75, President of The Manchester Italian Association said: ""There are several Italian cardinals but we don't mind what nationality the pope is.
""As long as he is a good man like Pope Francis.""
Ms Taurasi is in charge of the Italian community's annual procession with a statue of the Virgin Mary from Little Italy in Ancoats to Manchester Town Hall.
She said: ""Whoever [the new pope] is he would be very welcome to join us on our next procession through Manchester in July.""
Eva Ripoll Breau says we are all God's children so the pope's nationality is not important 
Like Italy, Spain has several papabile cardinals- the unofficial term for eligible cardinals coined by Vatican journalists.
But for Spanish ex-pat Eva Ripoll Breau, 53, the next pope's nationality is not an issue.
""Let's face it we are all the same children of God when it comes to sharing faith and love which does not rely on language and words alone but peace and kindness,"" she said.
Ms Ripoll Breau, who has lived in the UK for 30 years, added: "" I am confident that once again irrespective of his origin the choice will be the right one to be our shepherd.""
Ms Ripoll Breau, who runs a retirement home for priests in Blackpool, Lancashire, regularly visits family in her homeland and said people back home would have a ""great pride"" though if the next pope did end up being Spanish.

For more than a decade, a pair of Hobbit-inspired eagle sculptures have cast a watchful eye over visitors at New Zealand's Wellington Airport.
But the giant birds will be unfastened from the ceiling on Friday to make way for a new mystery exhibit, airport authorities said.
The eagles appear as messengers in JRR Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, which were adapted to film by New Zealand's Sir Peter Jackson.
The spectacular New Zealand landscapes featured in Mr Jackson's films are a consistent draw for tourists, who are greeted at the airport by the eagle sculptures.
""It's not unusual to see airborne departures from Wellington Airport, but in this case, it will be emotional for us,"" Wellington Airport chief executive Matt Clarke said in a statement.
The giant eagles will be placed in storage and there have not been long-term plans for them.
Each eagle weighs 1.2 tonnes (1,200kg) with a wingspan of 15m (49ft). Riding on the back of one of the birds is a sculpture of the wizard, Gandalf.
Made of polystyrene and with an internal steel skeleton, each eagle has hundreds of feathers, the longest one measuring 2.4m (8ft).
While the iconic eagles will soon be gone, not all is lost for fans of the franchise: Smaug the Magnificent, the dragon in The Hobbit, will continue to be displayed at the check-in area.
The sculptures were installed in 2013 amid the release of The Hobbit trilogy
The eagles were unveiled in 2013, around the time of the release of The Hobbit trilogy. The giant sculptures were produced by WÄtÄ Workshop, the New Zealand-based company that made costumes and props for The Lord of the Rings franchise.
""We're working with WÄtÄ Workshop on some exciting plans for a unique, locally themed replacement to take their place,"" Mr Clarke said. ""We'll unveil what's next later this year so keep watching the skies.""
In 2014, one of the eagles came crashing down during an earthquake. No one was injured from that accident."

US President Donald Trump says he is ""very friendly"" with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who was re-elected over the weekend in a landslide victory.
""We have had a very good relationship,"" Trump told the Sydney Morning Herald at the White House on Sunday, in his first remarks about the Australian election.
But the US president was less familiar with the other electoral candidate.
""I have no idea who the other person is that ran against him,"" he said of conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, who many saw as Australia's equivalent to Trump. 
In the lead-up to the election, Dutton and his Liberal National Coalition initially seemed to have an advantage over Albanese, who had to deal with public dissatisfaction over the government's handling of issues like housing and healthcare.
But on Saturday, Albanese defied the so-called ""incumbency curse"" and made a surprising comeback to secure a comfortable majority for a second term. 
The global uncertainty created by Trump's sweeping tariffs has been cited as a reason for a swing towards Albanese's centre-left Labor party. 
""Albanese, I'm very friendly with,"" Trump said on Sunday. ""I don't know anything about the election other than... the man that won is very good. He's a friend of mine.""
When asked about Albanese's previous remarks that Trump's tariffs on Australia were ""not the act of a friend"", Trump replied: ""Well, I can only say that he's been very, very nice to me, very respectful to me.""
Dutton ran a ""very Trumpian campaign"", according to former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who told BBC Newshour the US president was ""the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived"" the Coalition.
Dutton's brand of hard-line conservatism, his support for controversial immigration policies â like sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centres â and his fierce criticism of China all led to comparisons with Trump.
And while it's a likeness he rejected, the Coalition under his leadership pursued policies that seemed to have been borrowed from the Trump administration.
Dutton appeared to try to shake off these associations towards the end of his campaign, and in the final leaders' debate repeatedly told the audience that he didn't know Trump, before attempting to answer questions on him.
He had also long tried to convince voters that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with Trump, however, citing his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term.
Voters weren't convinced.
Dutton's campaign ended in defeat and Dutton lost his own seat of 24 years in Dickson. He resigned hours after polls closed on Saturday, as election results trickling in pointed to a Labor victory.

When the Catholic Church elects a new pope, the world watches not for a press conference or social media post, but for rising smoke from a small chimney atop the Sistine Chapel.
If the smoke is black, no new pope has been chosen. If it is white, a decision has been made: Habemus Papam - we have a pope. It's high drama, broadcast live to millions.
But what viewers don't see is the centuries-old ritual's hidden complexity: the carefully built chimney, the engineered stove and the precise chemical recipes, each part painstakingly designed to ensure that a wisp of smoke carries a clear message. 
Experts told the BBC that the process requires ""two custom fireworks"", smoke test rehearsals and Vatican firefighters on standby. It is meticulously organised by a team of engineers and Church officials working in unison.
Pope Francis died on Easter Monday aged 88 and with the funeral now over, attention has turned to the conclave - a private meeting through which a new pope will be chosen.
The Vatican has confirmed that cardinals will meet at St Peter's Basilica on 7 May to celebrate a special Mass before gathering inside the Sistine Chapel, where the complex vote will commence. 
The tradition of burning the cardinals' paper ballots dates back to the 15th Century and became part of conclave rituals aimed at ensuring transparency and preventing tampering, particularly after earlier papal election delays had led to public frustration and unrest.
Over time, the Vatican began using smoke as a way to communicate with the outside world while preserving the strict confidentiality of the vote.
And today, despite countless advances in communication, the Vatican has chosen to preserve the tradition.
""From antiquity onwards people have seen rising smoke - of animal and grain sacrifices in the Bible, or of burning incense in tradition - as a form of human communication with the divine,"" Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC.
""In Catholic tradition, prayers 'ascend' to God. The use of smoke evokes these religious rituals and the aesthetics of wonder and mystery that accompany them."" 
Prof Moss also says that the rising smoke allows people gathering in St Peter's Square ""to feel included - as if they are incorporated into this mysterious and secretive affair"".
The reasons are symbolic, but making it work in the 21st Century requires real-world engineering.
Inside the Sistine Chapel, two stoves are temporarily installed specifically for the conclave: one for burning ballots, the other to generate the smoke signals.
Both stoves are connected to a small flue - a pipe within a chimney that allows smoke to escape - that leads up through the chapel roof to the outside. On Friday, fire crews were seen on the roof, carefully securing the chimney top into place, while workmen erected scaffolding and constructed the stoves inside. 
The Sistine Chapel, which was built more than 500 years ago, is home to one of the most famous ceilings in the world. Adorned with Michelangelo's frescoes, it is not exactly designed for smoke signals, and the chimney needs to be installed discreetly and safely.
It's a complex process. Technicians either use an existing opening or create a temporary hatch through which the flue - typically made of a metal such as iron or steel - is inserted. The pipe runs from the stoves to the outside, emerging through the tiled roof above St Peter's Square. 
Every joint is sealed to prevent leaks and every component is tested. Specialists rehearse smoke tests in the days before the conclave begins, ensuring the chimney draw works in real time. Even Vatican firefighters are involved; on standby in case of malfunction.
""This is such a precise process because if one thing goes wrong, it's not just a technical failure - it becomes an international incident,"" Kevin Farlam, a structural engineer who has worked on heritage properties, told the BBC. ""It's not like putting a pipe on a pizza oven. Every part of the system has to be installed without damaging anything.""
This setup is constructed days before the cardinals arrive and is dismantled once a pope has been chosen.
Chimney installed on Sistine Chapel ahead of papal election
To ensure the signal is visible, Vatican technicians use a combination of chemical compounds.
""What they're essentially building here is two custom fireworks,"" Prof Mark Lorch, head of the department of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Hull, told the BBC.
""For black smoke, a mix of potassium perchlorate, anthracene, and sulfur is burned - producing thick, dark smoke.
""For white smoke, a combination of potassium chlorate, lactose, and pine rosin, is used, which burns clean and pale.
""In the past they tried to burn damp straw to create a darker smoke and dry straw to make lighter smoke - but this caused some confusion because sometimes it appeared grey.""
He explained that these chemicals are ""pre-packed into cartridges and ignited electronically"" so there's no ambiguity.
The addition of bell ringing - introduced during Pope Benedict XVI's election - now serves as confirmation and is used alongside the smoke signal.
Over the years, there have been suggestions to modernise the system: coloured lights, digital alerts, or even televised votes. But for the Vatican, the ritual is not just a communication tool - it's a moment of continuity with centuries of tradition.
""This is about tradition and secrecy, but it has real theological heft to it as well,"" Prof Moss said.
""Plus 'Catholic Church' and 'cutting edge' are far from synonyms - innovation is almost antithetical to ritual."""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was ""increasing the pressure"" with the aim of returning hostages held in Gaza and defeating Hamas militants.
Critics say the recent military offensive, after a ceasefire broke down, has failed to guarantee the release of captives, and question Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's objectives in the conflict.
Under the plan, the military said it would operate in new areas and ""destroy all infrastructure"" above and below ground.
Israeli media report that the Israeli security cabinet has approved the renewed military expansion in Gaza.
But reports suggest it will not happen until after President Donald Trump's trip to the region next week. 
International negotiations have failed to reach a new deal for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining 59 hostages being held by Hamas - 24 of whom are believed to be alive.
No Israeli hostages have been released since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire with Hamas.
Since then, Israel has seized large areas of Gaza, displacing hundreds of thousands of Gazans again.
Israel has said its aim was to put pressure on Hamas, a strategy that has included a blockade on humanitarian aid that has been in place for more than two months.
Aid agencies, who have reported acute shortages of food, water and medicines, have said this was a policy of starvation that could amount to a war crime, an allegation Israel rejects.
An expanded offensive will put more pressure on exhausted reservists, some of whom have been drafted five or six times since the war started, and renew concerns of the families of hostages, who have urged the government to reach a deal with Hamas, saying this is the only way to save those who are still alive.
The measure will also raise new questions about Netanyahu's real intentions in Gaza.
He has been frequently accused by the hostages' families and opponents of sabotaging negotiations for a deal, and of prolonging the war for political purposes, allegations he denies.
And almost 19 months into the war, he has not presented a day-after plan.
The military presented Netanyahu with its planned staged offensive in Gaza on Friday, according to local media.
In recent weeks, thousands of reservists have signed letters demanding  Netanyahu's government stop the fighting and concentrate on reaching a deal to bring back the hostages.
On Saturday evening, there were fresh protests across Israel calling for an end to the conflict.
In Tel Aviv, the mother of a hostage who remains in captivity called it a ""needless war"".
The Israeli military said on Sunday that two more Israeli soldiers had been killed in Gaza.
Earlier on Sunday, a missile fired from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi fighters landed near the main terminal of Israel's Ben Gurion airport. Netanyahu has vowed to retaliate.
The Houthis later responded to Israel's new plans for Gaza, saying they would impose an ""aerial blockade"" on Israel by repeatedly targeting its airports.
In Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry said as of 11:05 local time (09:05 BST) on Sunday, 40 people had been killed in the previous 24 hours, and a further 125 injured.
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,535 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
Of those, 2,436 have been killed since 18 March, when Israel restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip, the ministry said."

The Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro state, in co-ordination with the justice ministry, said suspects had recruited participants to carry out attacks using improvised explosives and the plan was aimed at gaining notoriety on social media.
The person responsible for the plan and a teenager were arrested, the police said.
Lady Gaga's team said they learned about the bomb threat only from media reports the morning after the gig. A crowd of more than two million people gathered for the concert, which was free to attend.
Police said the group that planned the attack had been spreading hate speech, mainly against children, adolescents and the LGBTQ+ community.
The alleged mastermind was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, while the teenager was detained in Rio for storing images that show child sex abuse.
Those responsible were also promoting the radicalisation of teenagers, including self-harm and violent content ""as a form of belonging and challenge among young people"".
Two million people attend free Lady Gaga concert in Brazil
A spokesperson for Lady Gaga told The Hollywood Reporter: ""We learned about this alleged threat via media reports this morning.
""Prior to and during the show, there were no known safety concerns, nor any communication from the police or authorities to Lady Gaga regarding any potential risks.""
The justice ministry said the suspects had identified themselves as Lady Gaga fans, known widely as ""Little Monsters"".
Police issued search warrants across the states of Rio de Janeiro, Mato Grosso, Rio Grande do Sul and Sao Paulo, and electronic devices and other materials were seized. 
""Operation Fake Monster"" was launched following a tip-off from Rio state police intelligence, which uncovered online groups encouraging violence among teenagers using coded language and extremist symbolism.
The concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy, with expectations it could bring in $100m (Â£75m).
In a massive security operation, 5,000 officers were deployed and attendees had to pass through metal detectors. Drones and facial recognition cameras were also used to police the event.
Lady Gaga, who last performed in Brazil in 2012, took the stage as part of a tour to promote her eighth album, Mayhem.

The picture, which was shared by official White House social media accounts, comes as Catholics mourn the death of Pope Francis, who died on 21 April, and prepare to choose the next pontiff. 
The New York State Catholic Conference accused Trump of mocking the faith. The post comes days after he joked to media: ""I'd like to be Pope.""
Trump is not the first president to be accused of mocking the Catholic faith. Former US President Joe Biden, a Catholic, caused outrage a year ago when he made the sign of the cross at a pro-abortion access rally in Florida. 
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni declined to answer questions about Trump's post during a briefing with journalists on Saturday. The Vatican is preparing to host a conclave to choose Francis's successor beginning on Wednesday.
The image posted by Trump on Friday night features him wearing a white cassock and pointed mitre, traditionally worn by a bishop. He wears a large cross around his neck, and has his finger held up, with a solemn facial expression.
The New York State Catholic Conference, which represents bishops in New York, took to X to criticise the picture. 
""There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr President,"" the group wrote.
""We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St Peter. Do not mock us.""
Left-leaning Italian former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi also blasted Trump's post. 
""This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,"" Renzi wrote in Italian on X. 
But the White House rejected any suggestion that the Republican president was making fun of the papacy.
""President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects to Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty,"" said press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
The backlash continued on Sunday, as New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan - who has been friendly with Trump for years - told reporters that he disliked the image.
""It wasn't good,"" he said, after attending a Mass in Rome. ""I hope he didn't have anything to do with that.""
Switching to Italian, he called it a ""brutta figura"", a phrase meaning a bad or embarrassing impression.
Asked if the White House should take down the image and apologise, he said - again in Italian - ""who knows"" and declined to speak more about it."

A woman missing for nearly 63 years has been found alive and well after the case into her disappearance was reviewed, police in the US state of Wisconsin said.
Audrey Backeberg was 20 years old when she disappeared from her home in the small city of Reedsburg on 7 July 1962.
In a statement, Sauk County Sheriff Chip Meister said Ms Backeberg's disappearance ""was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play"".
The sheriff said she was living outside Wisconsin, but did not provide any further details.
According to Wisconsin Missing Persons Advocacy, a non-profit group, Ms Backeberg was married and had two children when she went missing.
The group said that days before she went missing, Ms Backeberg, now 82, had filed a criminal complaint against her husband, whom she had married at the age of 15, alleging he had beaten her and threatened to kill her.
On the day she disappeared, she left home to pick up her pay cheque from the woollen mill where she worked.
The couple's 14-year-old babysitter told police she and Ms Backeberg then hitchhiked to Madison, Wisconsin's state capital, and from there caught a bus to Indianapolis, Indiana, about 300 miles (480km) away.
The babysitter then became nervous and wanted to return home, but Ms Backeberg refused and was last seen walking away from the bus stop.
The Sauk County Sheriff's Office said investigators pursued numerous leads in the case but it had gone cold before a comprehensive review of old case files was carried out earlier this year.
The detective who solved the case, Isaac Hanson, told local news station WISN, external that an online ancestry account belonging to Ms Backeberg's sister was crucial in helping locate the missing woman.
Det Hanson said he contacted local sheriffs where Ms Backeberg now lives, and spoke to her on the phone for 45 minutes.
""I think she just was removed and, you know, moved on from things and kind of did her own thing and led her life,"" he told WISN. ""She sounded happy. Confident in her decision. No regrets."""

""I'll be an eight-year president, I'll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important,"" Trump told NBC's Meet the Press with Kristen Welker in an interview that aired on Sunday. 
Trump, 78, has previously said that he was ""not joking"" about wanting to serve a third, or even fourth, term as US president. 
He later said his statements were meant to troll the ""fake news media"".
His company, The Trump Organization, has been selling ""Trump 2028"" hats, fuelling armchair speculation that he may seek to remain in office after his second term ends in January 2029.
In the interview, recorded from his residence in Florida on Friday, Trump said that he has had many ""requests"" from people asking that he consider seeking to remain in office. 
""So many people want me to do it,"" Trump said, just days after celebrating his first 100 days of his second term. 
""It's something that, to the best of my knowledge, you're not allowed to do. I don't know if that's constitutional that they're not allowing you to do it or anything else,"" Trump said.
He added that ""there are many people selling the 2028 hat"".
""But this is not something I'm looking to do,"" he said, going on to list Republicans who could take his place, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  
The Constitution's 22nd Amendment says that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice"".
Changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the country's state-level governments.
However, some Trump supporters suggest there is a loophole in the Constitution, which has been untested in court.
Asked by NBC whether anyone has approached him with these theories, Trump deflected, answering that ""in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things"". 
During the interview, Trump also rejected criticism of his handling of the economy.
""Look, yeah. Everything's OK,"" he said after his tariff plan roiled international economies, leading the US economy to shrink for the first time since 2022. 
""I said, this is a transition period. I think we're going to do fantastically,"" he added.
Asked if the US economy may continue to shrink, he responded: ""Anything can happen. But I think we're going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.""
He later added that there is a chance that tariffs may be permanent, telling the interviewer: ""If somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?""
Trump also denied that Americans will need to prepare to see fewer goods for sale in shops, as the trade war continues. 
""No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying they don't need to have 30 dolls. They can have three,"" he said.
""They don't need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.""
Trump was asked about the Fifth Amendment right to due process under the law, which guarantees certain rights to people accused of committing of a crime.
Critics have said his deportation plan has violated this process, and that his administration has removed people who have not yet been charged with any crime, and therefore have not had any opportunity to present a legal defence. 
""Don't you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president?"" asked Welker, suggesting that he could be disregarding the presidential oath of office, which requires him to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"".
Trump responded: ""I don't know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.""
Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the White House must work to ""facilitate"" the return of a migrant who was accidentally deported to jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration has argued that they lack the authority to force the Central American country to return him to the US.
Trump says he 'could' return mistakenly deported man if he wanted to
What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?
Trump criticised after posting AI image of himself as Pope
Trump said that he could not ""rule out"" using military force to annex Greenland, but suggested that he is not considering a military attack on Canada in order to force the US northern neighbour to become the 51st US state. 
""I don't see it with Canada,"" Trump said, days after Canadian voters chose Liberal Party leader Mark Carney as their prime minister, in a stunning rejection of the Conservative Party.
""They think we are going to protect them, and really we are,"" Trump continued.
""But the truth is, they don't carry their full share, and it's unfair to the United States and our taxpayers.""
Carney is scheduled to visit Trump at the White House on Tuesday.
Trump was also asked about his decision to declare an immigration state of emergency on his first day in office, and whether the border is now ""secure"".
""We have the most secure border we've ever had,"" he said, leading Welker to question why the emergency declaration remains in place, after immigration figures showed that illegal crossings have plummeted to the lowest levels in decades. 
He claimed that the emergency is in the court system, not at the border.
""The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people that we want to take out, and we have some judges that want everybody to go to court,"" he said.
""It's an overall emergency on immigration,"" Trump told NBC, adding that he has no plans to lift the order in the near future.

The unnamed man was attacked in broad daylight in central Paris on Thursday. He was bundled into a delivery van by four men wearing balaclavas, police sources told Le Figaro newspaper.
French media say the victim had one finger missing when he was rescued from a house in Palaiseau, south of Paris, on Saturday.
Four suspects were arrested. It is the third abduction connected to France's cryptocurrency industry so far this year.
The victim in the latest case is reported to be in his 50s. Le Parisien newspaper said his kidnappers demanded his wealthy son pay a 5-7m euro ransom (Â£4.2-5.9m).
Police were reportedly led to the house by phone signals. The four suspects are being questioned.
In a post on X late on Saturday, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau congratulated investigators for an ""exceptional job in freeing this man"".
The incident comes less than four months after David Balland, co-founder of the cryptocurrency firm Ledger, was abducted with his wife at their home in central France. 
They were rescued by police within days. Mr Balland also had a finger cut off. 
The criminals had demanded a 10m euro ransom (Â£8.5m). Six men and a woman were arrested in connection with that case.
And in early January, a 56-year-old man was found alive in the boot of a car near the western city of Le Mans.

Organisers of a festival celebrating Ukrainian culture say the event will ""bring refugees together"" and ""provide joy"".
The Gloucester Ukraine Festival will feature art exhibitions and music performances from Ukrainians based all over the UK who have fled the conflict.
It will include a 60-metre-long selection of paintings and photographs called 'Lines of Resistance', which will be showcased in Ukraine as a ""message of solidarity"".
Event volunteer Robin Burton said: ""This festival aims to introduce the people of Gloucester to the incredible richness of Ukraine culture"".
The event will take place at the The Folk of Gloucester from 3 May to 18 May.
Olha Barvynka, artist and curater of the 'Scattered Light' exhibition within the Gloucester Ukraine festival, said she is ""very proud"" to be part of it.
The name of the exhibition ""stems from the idea that we as refugees are scattered around here and there with all our different stories"", explained Ms Barvynka.
It is a mixed-media exhibition spanning across multiple rooms, which features the work of 10 Ukrainian artists - two of whom are currently in Ukraine.
Ms Barvynka, who is originally from Bila Tsverkva in Kyiv, moved to the UK in April 2023 and now lives in Cheltenham.
She discovered her passion for art whilst in Ukraine, and is now in her second year of a Fine Art degree at the University of Gloucestershire.
""The exhibition has helped to reunite and bring hope and confidence to many of these artists,"" she said.
""Some of these artists didn't know each other and I can see how it has helped uplift them.""
'Scattered Light' is a mixed-media exhibition curated by Olha Barvynk
Artist Russell Haines, who curated 'Lines of Resistance', said the piece will ""document Gloucester's grassroots response to the Russian invasion"".
""All of the paintings and small artworks are for sale, to help us take Lines of Resistance to Ukraine"", he said.
""Our goal is to exhibit the painting in Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Odesa, as a message of solidarity from Gloucester to the people of Ukraine before bringing it back to Gloucester to be exhibited here"".
The paintings will be shipped to Kyiv after the festival
The festival will also feature performances from the Bristol Kozachky Choir and Stroud-based dance group Styx Border Morris.
It will exhibit the work of Ruslan Ganushch, a war photographer who was killed in the conflict earlier this year.
""[The festival] aims to give refugees from the conflict in Ukraine, the opportunity to get together and be proud of their own culture"", Mr Burton added. 
""It aims to provide everyone with as much joy as possible"".

The area where Elon Musk's SpaceX company operates on the southern tip of Texas is to officially become a city called Starbase. 
Residents approved incorporating a patch of land as the new municipality in an election on Saturday.
Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. Results published online by Cameron County show 212 votes in favour versus six opposed. Billionaire Musk wrote ""Starbase, Texas is now a real city!"" on his social media platform X.
The new city covers about 1.6 sq miles (3.9 sq km) that was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in the area in 2012.
The city's government will comprise of a mayor and two commissioners who will have power over planning, taxation and other local issues. But some nearby residents have opposed the measure and accused the company of harming the local environment.
Since SpaceX started buying land in the area, company housing and SpaceX facilities have sprouted up, and Mr Musk has a residence. Other evidence of the tycoon's presence includes a road called Memes Street and a giant bust of the tycoon himself, which was recently vandalised.
About 500 people are estimated to live nearby.
The possibility of incorporation as a city was rumoured for years before a petition submitted in December 2024 paved the way for Saturday's vote.
The first mayor of Starbase will be Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice-president. Peden ran unopposed, as did two other residents with SpaceX ties who will fill the two commissioner seats. 
The BBC contacted Mr Peden for comment.
Starbase will be a Type C city - a category of municipality of fewer than 5,000 people and a designation that among other things will allow officials to levy a property tax of up to 1.5%, according to the Texas Municipal League.
A bill currently winding through the Texas state legislature could give the new city's officials the ability to close a local highway and limit access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches and other company activity.
Currently closures around SpaceX launches are managed by Cameron County, which includes the nearby city of Brownsville and the resort town of South Padre Island.

SpaceX routinely launches rockets from its Starbase site, but environmental activists say the company has adversely affected the area
The result of the vote could set up tussles between county officials and Starbase over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX looks to increase the number of launches at its Texas site from five to 25 per year.
The top official in Cameron County, Judge Eddie Trevino Jr, opposes the state bill that would allow Starbase control over closures.
In recent years Musk has moved many of his operations and corporate headquarters from California to Texas, citing more favourable regulation and his opposition to California's Democratic Party-dominated politics.
The headquarters of his companies X and Boring are now on the outskirts of Bastrop, a small city near the state capital Austin and about a five-and-a-half-hour drive north of Starbase.
Inside the rural Texas town where Elon Musk is basing his business empire
In contrast with Starbase, the development outside Austin does not include much new housing for company workers â most of whom live in Bastrop or other surrounding communities.
Environmental groups have criticised SpaceX's impact on nearby wildlife, and say the company has increased light pollution and littered the area with debris from rocket launches. 
In 2024 the company was fined nearly $150,000 (Â£113,000) by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for dumping waste water.
The company has called the fines the result of ""disagreements over paperwork"" and maintains it follows environmental laws. The BBC approached SpaceX for comment."

A drone attack launched by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) struck a military airport in the city of Port Sudan on Sunday, according to the Sudanese army.
It marks the first time RSF attacks have reached the city - the de-facto capital of Sudan's military-led government - since the conflict between the warring factions erupted two years ago.
Sudanese army spokesperson Nabil Abdullah said the RSF had launched several ""suicide drones"" at the eastern Red Sea port city, targeting the Osman Digna Air Base, ""a goods warehouse and some civilian facilities"".
He said no injuries had been reported but the attack had caused ""limited damage"". The RSF has not commented on the incident.
Sudan plunged into conflict in April 2023 when a vicious power struggle broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF, a powerful paramilitary group, ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule.
At least 150,000 people are estimated to have died in the ensuing civil war, with some 12 million forced to flee their homes. 
The United Nations has described the situation in Sudan as the world's largest and most devastating humanitarian crisis, with over 30 million people in need of aid and millions facing acute food shortages and famine.
Prior to the attacks on Sunday, Port Sudan had avoided bombardment and was regarded as one of the safest places in the war-ravaged nation.
After the SAF lost control of the capital Khartoum early in the war, Port Sudan became the de facto headquarters for the military-led government helmed by General Abdel Fattah-al Burhan.
UN agencies moved their offices and staff to the coastal city and hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians have fled there during the war. 
""We were on the way to the plane when we were quickly evacuated and taken out of the terminal,"" a traveller told AFP news agency on Sunday following the strikes.
Video footage on social media, which the BBC has not independently verified, appears to show an explosion and huge plumes of black smoke billowing into the sky.
The airport has been closed and all flights suspended, a government source told AFP news agency.
The two-year conflict has left the nation divided into rival zones.
The RSF, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo - known as Hemedti - controls most of the vast Darfur region in western Sudan, and parts of the south.
The military-backed government controls eastern and northern Sudan, including the key Red Sea city of Port Sudan.
Sunday's strike is the latest in a string of RSF drone attacks on military and civilian infrastructure in army-held territory. On Saturday, an army source reported a drone attack on Kassala, on Sudan's eastern border, about 250 miles (400km) from the nearest RSF position.
The SAF has taken back swathes of territory in recent months, including regaining control of the presidential palace in Khartoum in March.
Taking back the capital was seen as a turning point in the two-year civil war, but while the SAF currently have momentum, it is unlikely that either side can achieve a victory that will enable them to govern the whole of Sudan, according to a report by the International Crisis Group.
This is Sudan's third civil war in 70 years, but is regarded as worse than the others, tearing through the core of the country and hardening divisions.
Following a coup in 2021, a council of generals ran Sudan - led by the two men at the centre of the current conflict.
Al-Burhan was head of Sudan's armed forces and in effect the country's president, while Hemedti was his deputy and leader of the RSF.
The pair disagreed about the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule - in particular plans to absorb the 100,000-strong RSF into the army.
Tensions between the army and the RSF grew as a deadline for forming a civilian government approached, before fighting between the two sides for control of the Sudanese state began.
International efforts to broker peace have failed and both sides are backed by foreign powers who have poured weapons into the country."

TV viewers may be glued to the new series of Race Across the World - but one adventurous cyclist has just completed his own remarkable ride across the globe.
Nathan Hurley of Blackwood in Caerphilly county set off on his bicycle from Cardiff on 1 March - St David's Day - 2024.
More than 14 months, 26 countries and 16,250 miles (26,000km) later, he has arrived in Sydney.
The ""exhausting"" journey from south Wales to New South Wales is a ""dream come true"" for Nathan and has so far raised Â£4,000 for the Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) Trust.
The self-confessed ""urban dweller"" admitted setting off with a tent, stove and a blow-up pillow was a daunting prospect. 
Nor was he a particularly good or keen cyclist having almost fallen off his just 50m (164ft) into the ride leaving his nervous parents looking on with their heads in their hands.
""One of the challenging things is being on your own,"" he said from Sydney.
""I've been racking up 60 to 80 miles and sometimes up to 10 hours on the saddle each day but it's taken a lot mentally as well as physically.
""I'm not an outdoorsman and out of all of my friends I'm the guy who doesn't do adventure well. I always forget something.
""I like my flat whites and eggs benedict so it's been a real struggle when I've been out there camping and cooking.""
Nathan began his epic journey crossing Europe
Then onto the ancient Silk Road
Across the Caucuses
Sometimes sleeping wherever he could
On to South-East Asia
Before reaching Australia
The 35-year-old travelled through France, across the Alps and onto the ancient Silk Road from northern Italy to Turkey before crossing the Caucuses where he hit his first diplomatic hurdle. 
To avoid conflict and visa restrictions he took a short flight from Armenia to Kazakhstan where he continued to climb the Pamir mountain ranges to China, not only overcoming the challenges of altitude but suspicious local police as he crossed the Taklamakan and Gobi deserts. 
""I didn't mind the police following me, they made me feel like a VIP but they weren't very inconspicuous, they were the only car following 200m behind me at 12mph,"" he said.
From there Nathan rode south through South-East Asia to Jakarta, Indonesia and then flew to Australia where he embarked on a 2,500-mile (4,000km) journey from Perth to Sydney.
""Australia is famously wider than the moon and for weeks it really felt like that in the heat,"" he said.
""It's home to wonderful people but it doesn't help that I'm terrified of snakes.""
While on the road Nathan has been invited to two weddings and shared countless meals with locals curious about the cycling Welshman. 
""Spending months speaking to strangers through a translation app can be exhausting [but] you wouldn't believe how many remote villagers know who Gareth Bale is.""
Nathan was due to finish in Sydney but has decided to continue his adventure
And he has decided he is not stopping there. 
Having taken redundancy from his job as a furniture design manager he now intends to cycle all the way home, ploughing on to New Zealand before flying to Alaska and then Africa with the aim of returning to Cardiff by Christmas.
""I had every intention of coming home after Sydney but I've got a bit more time now and I've got the bug, which is a bit of a surprise.""
Nathan hopes that his journey can encourage others to take up cycle touring as a mode of travel and form of sustainable tourism.
""I've learnt to love it. I just feel I'm on the journey now and I've got it into my head I'm halfway home.
""And there's no point in cycling half way around the world, is there?"""

Young people who grew up in care have been invited to turn their ""pain into power"" by creating art that describes their lived experiences.
The Woven Worlds project has delivered free art workshops to two groups - young people in Manchester who have spent time in care, and survivors of war in Kitgum, northern Uganda. 
Fashion designer Jessie Stringer-Fewtrill, who grew up in care, obtained funding from the British Council to deliver the workshops with a Ugandan friend. 
""I used art and words as a form of self expression, like creative therapy,"" said Miss Stringer-Fewtrill, who added that she loved to see the workshops' participants benefiting in the same way.  
She said she hoped the sessions would help encourage care leavers to recognise that coming from a place of hardship is ""something to be celebrated"". 
Artwork created in the workshops will be used for a fashion collection made from sustainable materials.
Miss Stringer-Fewtrill said being involved in the project had been ""really special"" since, for many years, she did not talk about her time in the care sector.
Sharing her own ""lived experiences"" had created a safe space where people could talk openly and express themselves, she said.
""I always say 'pain into power', so it's about channelling that energy and being powerful together,"" explained Miss Stringer-Fewtrill.
""Even though you've come from hardship, it's like 'Yeah, I've come out of that hardship and that's something to be celebrated'."" 
Katende Godfrey learned his fashion designing skills from tailors in Uganda
Katende Godfrey, who works for Ugandan brand IGC Fashion, co-led the Woven Worlds project.
He delivered workshops in Uganda to a community impacted by civil war.
Those taking part in the sessions will also have their work featured in a fashion collection. 
He said working with the community had been ""challenging"" and ""impactful"". 
""What we have in this collection is beyond people's imagination,"" said Mr Godfrey. 
Mr Godfrey and Miss Stringer-Fewtrill met in Uganda five years ago and said they both knew they wanted to work together because of their aligned interests.
Only this year, however, did they find the time to develop ideas and apply for funding.
They were ""elated"" to subsequently be awarded the International Collaboration Grant by the British Council, external, which aims to promote ""peace and prosperity by building connections, understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries worldwide"".
Miss Stringer-Fewtrill said both she and Mr Godfrey cared about ""community impact, upskilling, and raising awareness about the effects of fast fashion"".
Working on the project also gave Mr Godfrey a chance to visit the UK for the first time, and learn new artistic techniques, like naturally dying textiles.
Megan (left) and Humaira (right) said they enjoyed the chance to express themselves with people from a similar background 
Megan, 21, and 19-year-old Humaira attended the workshops in Manchester.
""At times it can be isolating in the care system,"" explained Megan, adding that the project had allowed her to meet people from similar backgrounds.
Both said they had learned about the importance of self-expression and how to positively channel their emotions into something creative. 
""Care leavers have such unique experiences and it's important to create something from that,"" said Humaira. 
The final fashion collection will be revealed in September
Mr Godfrey said he hoped it would further teach and encourage people ""to have conversations before they judge""."

At least seven people have been killed after a hospital and market were bombed in South Sudan, a medical charity has said, as fears grow of a return to civil war.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said helicopter gunships dropped a bomb on the pharmacy of the hospital it runs in Old Fangak, Jonglei state, burning it down, before firing on the town for 30 minutes. A drone then bombed a local market, MSF said.
The hospital is the only one in Fangak county, which has a population of more than 110,000 people, MSF said, and all its medical supplies were destroyed. 
The charity called the attack, which left 20 people injured, a ""clear violation of international humanitarian law"".
MSF spokesman Mamman Mustapha told the BBC's Newshour programme the charity was still trying to establish the facts, but local witnesses had said the aircraft were ""government forces helicopters"".
""The hospital is clearly marked as 'hospital' with our logo,"" he said. ""We have shared also our coordinates for all the warring parties in the area so the hospital should be known to both parties as a hospital.""
There was no immediate comment from South Sudan's government. The BBC has contacted the foreign affairs ministry.
In recent weeks, Nicholas Haysom, who leads the UN mission in South Sudan, has warned the country is ""teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war"".
Those worries have been stoked by an escalating feud between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar.
Hours before the hospital bombing, the head of the army, Paul Majok Nang, promised punitive strikes after several barges on a river were hijacked.
He blamed those attacks on a militia linked to Vice-President Machar, who has not commented on the claim.
Machar was arrested in March along with several of his associates, and accused of trying to stir up a rebellion.
The government has recently listed counties it considers to be hostile - in other words allied to Machar. 
That increased the suspicion that South Sudan could be headed for another conflict involving the country's two largest ethnic groups.
South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but two years later, a civil war erupted when President Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup.
The ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes â more than a fifth of the population.
A peace deal was reached in 2018 and a unity government forged with the same two men at the helm, but elections that were supposed to have been called since then have not happened.
The peace deal was also meant to see the end of all the militias and the formation of one united army â but that has not happened and many armed groups are still loyal to different politicians.
The current crisis was sparked earlier this year when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir.
Then, in March, a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general.
Rights groups have been calling for the military to stop bombing civilian areas.

Some Liberal party members have called for a ""serious review"", with one adviser summing up the loss as a failure of ""the Dutton experiment"".
Dutton has also become the first federal opposition leader to ever lose their own seat at the same time as losing an election, which means he has been ousted from parliament.
Labor's Ali France defeated Dutton in his home base of Dickson in Queensland.
In his first public appearance after Labor's emphatic win, prime minister Anthony Albanese told media outside a Sydney cafe on Sunday that ""the Australian people voted for unity rather than division"".
The Liberal party's most crushing losses were in Australia's major cities, where party members have been all but wiped out in metropolitan areas including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide.
Liberal MP Keith Wolahan has called for a ""serious review"" of the systemic issues that led to the party's shock defeat.
""You have to acknowledge things went wrong,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Insiders program.
""We have to listen to Australians. They have sent us a message, and our first task is to hear it. And that often takes time.""
Wolahan represents the seat of Menzies in Victoria, and said it was very likely he would also lose his seat.
When asked if Peter Dutton himself was the problem, Wolahan declined to answer directly, but said he has great respect for the Liberal leader.
Some were more blunt, like Andrew Carswell, a former adviser to Australia's last Liberal prime minister, who told the ABC ""the Dutton experiment failed"".
He went on to describe Saturday's loss as ""a complete catastrophe for the Coalition"", which he said showed that Australians had ""clear hesitation with Peter Dutton"".
The looming presence of Donald Trump has also been cited as a major factor for thwarting Dutton's already inconsistent campaign, with many people drawing parallels between him and the American president.
Dutton's loss has now set in motion the scramble for a new Liberal party leader.
Carswell was hopeful about the prospect of some ""very good up-and-coming Liberal MPs"" stepping into leadership roles.
Those tipped as most likely contenders for the top job include shadow treasurer Angus Taylor and deputy leader Sussan Ley.
Shadow immigration minister Dan Tehan and shadow minister of defence Andrew Hastie have also been mentioned.
But without a clear frontrunner, the Liberal party will have to try to regroup in the coming days - as well as develop a new strategy to win back the voters they lost."

The pop star's biggest ever concert was paid for by the city in an attempt to revitalise Rio's economy. 
They expect it could bring in $100m (Â£75m) to the local economy. 
Saturday's performance was part of a promotional tour for Lady Gaga's eighth album, Mayhem, whose songs include Abracadabra and Die With a Smile. She last performed in Brazil in 2012.
Some fans - known as Gaga's ""Little Monsters"" - began queuing early in the morning and waited in long lines to gain access to the beach.
A massive security operation was in place, with 5,000 police officers on duty and attendees having to pass through metal detectors. The authorities also used drones and facial recognition cameras to help police the event. 
Lady Gaga is not the first person to play a free concert in Rio. Madonna gave a  concert on Copacabana beach in May 2024, which was also paid for by the city.

""You waited for me, you waited for more than 10 years for me,"" an emotional Lady Gaga told the crowds as she unfurled a Brazilian flag.  
""Brazil, I'm ready. I'm going to give it my all.""
The pop star appeared in Brazil-themed costumes for some of her acts, with outfits inspired by the national football team. 
Thousands sang along with her best known hits including Alejandro, Poker Face and Abracadabra, creating an electric atmosphere as many waved rainbow-themed fans and watched on huge screens along the beach. 
Fans travelled from all across the country to see the grandiose performance.  
One man, 28-year-old Luan Messias, said he spent all night on a bus from Itanhaem in neighbouring Sao Paulo state.
Alisha Duarte, 22, told AFP news agency she started queuing at 0740 in the morning. ""Lady Gaga is worth it! It's going to get super crowded, but we'll survive,"" she said. 
Another fan, Paulo Oliveira, explained why people were so excited about the concert. She ""tells us that we can be who we are, that we can be different and that being different is cool,"" he told Reuters. 
It's going to be an ""unforgettable show"", concert attendee Lai Borges told Reuters on her way in. ""It's going to be emotional and I'm going to cry a lot,"" she said. 
As the event drew to a close, Lady Gaga told the audience - in a reference to the nickname for Lady Gaga fans - ""we are monsters and monsters never die,"" and she brought the concert to a close with Bad Romance, perhaps her most famous song.
Local officials say more than two million people attended the performance"
713,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20zermp0lzo,2025-05-04 03:50:05,"Polygamy and pageantry on display at a mass wedding in South Africa,","The bride, Evelyn Sekgalakane, sparkled in white as she walked down the aisle hand-in-hand with Shirley Molala, who was about to become her ""sister wife"" at a mass wedding celebration at a South African church that encourages polygamy.
Behind them came the groom Lesiba Molala, who was marrying another wife at the elaborate ceremony at the International Pentecostal Holiness Church (IPHC) south-west of Johannesburg.
The polygamous bridal party was among 55 marriages that took place there on Easter Sunday - a loud, long and joyous occasion.
Only seven of the unions were welcoming an extra wife to the family - but all were open to doing so in the future.
""He is a God [who approves] of polygamy,"" rang out repeatedly across the packed auditorium. Polygamy is the practice of having more than one spouse at the same time.
Shirley, who is Mr Molala's second wife and has been married to him for 25 years, told me ahead of the big day: ""I love polygamy because it is rooted in Biblical teaching"" - a reference to passages in the Old Testament of the Bible.
Evelyn (R) told the BBC that over the last few months Shirley (L) had become her confidante as she prepared to marry Lesiba Molala - seen behind them
She was handpicked by his first wife, who has since died, while a third wife had also joined the family - leaving in the wake of a leadership row that split the congregation.
The 48-year-old explained that as the process of adding another spouse had started spiritually, it made it easier to regard the incoming wife as a sister and friend.
""We [first three wives] got along to a point where we'd wear matching clothes. So I learnt this from the Molala family and that's why I was able to do the same for Evelyn.""
Before the official start of the marriage ceremonies - which each involved an exchange of rings but no spoken vows - the jubilant congregation gathered outside the auditorium at around noon in a riot of colour and noise.
Loudspeakers blaring out church songs competed with the cheers of thousands of well-wishers - some of whom were dressed in the church's blue-and-white uniforms, while others sported their Sunday best.
Over the next five hours bridal parties arrived to great fanfare and tried to outdo one another: one large contingent of bridesmaids was dressed in different shades of electric lime green, another featured a Gucci-clad groomsman.
Beforehand church officials had checked the outfits at the gate to make sure everyone in attendance was suitably dressed - no skimpy outfits, bare arms or trousers allowed for women, who also had to cover their heads, with jackets prescribed for men.
The church has a strict moral code - the sexes sit separately inside the auditorium during ordinary services and dating is not allowed.
""I only learned about polygamy when I joined the church and was taught that simply dating a woman was not allowed. So because I realised that one woman would not be enough for me, I felt that rather than cheat, let me get another wife,"" Lesiba Molala, 67, told the BBC.
These mass weddings take place three times a year at the church's grand headquarters in the small rural town of Zuurbekom - at Easter, in September and December.
After each wedding party's raucous arrival was over, the group walked a red carpet to take photos.
Then it was time for the church's leader, Leonard Frederick G Modise, to arrive - and his entrance almost stole the show.
Referred to as ""the comforter"", he was ushered in - along with his family - by a marching band, horse parade and a series of luxury vehicles, among them a midnight sapphire Rolls Royce.
A convoy that included two Rolls Royces heralded the arrival of the church leader Leonard Frederick G Modise
A big band marched into the auditorium before the bridal parties came down the aisle 
Sister wives to be, Shirley and Evelyn, shared a joke before going down the aisle
As the sun began to set, it was time for the official programme to begin - with each entourage entering the auditorium to make their way slowly down the white-carpeted aisle.
I caught up with the Molala trio before their turn. Evelyn was excited and all smiles about her dress: ""I told you, you would not recognise me!""
The service, which went on until 22:00, ended with a blessing from Mr Modise for the new couples and their other spouses - with the festivities going on long into the night.
While such pageantry is often associated with weddings here - albeit not on such a grand scale - multiple marriage ceremonies are unusual, even in a country as diverse and multicultural as South Africa.
So too is the inclusion of polygamous unions. While polygyny - the marriage of a man to several women - is allowed in South Africa, such relationships are usually registered as customary marriages and are not celebrated in church.
However, the IPHC is one of what is known as an African independent church, which is allowed to officiate them - as long as the marriages are also registered with the country's home affairs department.
According to the 2022 census, more than 85% of South Africans identified as Christian, followed by 8%, who said they practised traditional African beliefs.
Several churches with large congregations mix both belief systems - like the IPHC - though mainstream Protestant and Catholic churches remain the biggest denominations.
For the IPHC, polygamy has been taught and encouraged and has ""evolved with the church"" from its inception in Soweto in 1962 to a congregation today of 3.1 million across southern Africa, senior church official Mpho Makwana told the BBC.
Mr Molala married his first wife in 1991, six years after joining the church. She was also a member - an important factor for those looking to take a spouse. The church explicitly forbids marriages to outsiders.
Nine years later, Mr Molala and his wife sat down to discuss the expansion of the family. After a church-wide search, the couple settled on Shirley who was then 23.
""I felt important [because I was] noticed among the many women in the church,"" she said.
Evelyn too was selected after a church-initiated process that began in February. She admitted it took a while for her to warm to the idea of joining a polygamous union, though Shirley's receptive attitude made it easier for her.
The 44-year-old had grown up in the church but later left, going on to have three children, before returning to the fold a few years ago.
With his marriage to Evelyn, Mr Molala has informally adopted her children, bringing the total number of his offspring to 13.
Each of his families live in separate houses - although Evelyn will join him at his home for the early stages of the marriage.
Of the 55 marriages that took place on Easter Sunday at the IPHC, seven were polygamous
Polygamy, traditionally practised in some South African cultures, does divide people in the country. In recent years several reality shows have given an insight into life in plural families - and sparked debate about whether they are still relevant.
Prof Musa Xulu, a religious expert with South Africa's Cultural, Religious and Linguistics Rights Communities Rights Commission, said it was common to come across families in such unions who had been devastated in the initial stages of the HIV/Aids pandemic, which has ravaged South Africa.
The situation had stabilised, though it was still ""a big problem"", he told the BBC.
Mr Makwana said the IPHC had addressed this head on - putting in place measures about a decade ago to better protect couples and polygamous unions from HIV/Aids after one family's experience, which had been an ""eye-opener"" for the church's leadership.
Those intending to get married must first get tested for HIV.
""You can't proceed without going through that processâ¦ so there are no surprises ahead,"" he said.
The couple must tell each other their results, decide whether to continue and then the church keeps a record on file.
This ""100% transparency"" also reduced the number of divorces that had often resulted when deception came to light, he said.
Prof Xulu said churches like the IPHC, while having an ""eclectic approach to Christianity"" that was ""half-Christian, half-African"", did have doctrinal justifications for their traditions as well as ""internal dispute-resolution mechanisms"".
""They will assist families who are undergoing distress,"" he said.
The IPHC is heavily involved in the vetting process once a proposal has been accepted. It takes several months and is marked by three pre-nuptial ceremonies.
During this time, couples were ""taken through a spiritual process of ensuring they know what they are committing to"", Mr Makwana said.
Most couples are relative strangers before the formal proposal is made - as was the case for Freddy Letsoalo, 35, and 31-year-old Rendani Maemu.
They also tied the knot in Zuurbekom over Easter - both marrying for the first time.
Mr Letsoalo said he first spotted his bride-to-be at a friend's wedding nearly a decade ago - also celebrated at one of the mass marriage ceremonies.
But they ""didn't talk or do anything else"" after their initial meeting, he told the BBC.
""It was love at first sight but remember, we knowâ¦ the teachings of our church.""
Rendani Maemu told the BBC that as she was raised in the church, she always knew she might be a ""first or second wife"" 
While the two would later become Facebook friends, their interactions were restricted to birthday wishes - that was until December 2024 when Mr Letsoalo set the wheels in motion, alerting first his family and then the church's leadership of his intentions.
""I wasn't aware that he was interested in me. When I became awareâ¦ I was excited. I've always dreamt of my wedding day,"" a blushing Ms Maemu, who was raised in the church, told me before the nuptials.
Her dream came true and she did look resplendent before going down the aisle along with nine bridesmaids in a crystal-encrusted gown, tiara and a bridal train several metres long.
While the couple are currently focused on their new life together, both are willing to embrace polygamy should the right opportunity present itself in the future.
""I know there's a chance that my husband will want to enter into a polygamous marriage,"" said the new Mrs Letsoalo.
""I believe in polygamy.""
A view that may be controversial for many South Africans.

Ahead of Sweden's Walpurgis festival to mark the start of spring, young people were busy selecting outfits or getting their hair done. Not all of them made it there alive.
At a hair salon in Uppsala, a city north of Stockholm, three young men who police say were aged between 15 and 20 were shot dead on Tuesday before the celebrations started.
The horror left many shaken in the build-up to the festival, known as Valborg in Swedish, which is typically a convivial affair each 30 April on the eve of the Christian feast day of Saint Walpurga. Celebrated nationwide, Uppsala hosts the country's largest and most high-profile Walpurgis events, popular with students.
The partying did go ahead in full swing, but a subtle heaviness hung over the Swedish blue and yellow flags which fluttered around the city.
And now, with the festival finished, it's only police tape - not flags - fluttering outside the basement barber shop where the shooting took place close to Vaksala Square.
The attack happened the day before the Walpurgis festival in Uppsala
""It's really sad,"" says 20-year-old student Yamen Alchoum, who is in the area to eat at a nearby food truck. He says he was at another barber shop on the night of the shootings, but previously had his hair cut at this salon multiple times. ""I think if I was there [on Tuesday]â¦I would be, like, involved in the shooting. And it's a bit scary.""
According to witnesses speaking to Swedish media TV4 and Aftonbladet, two of the young victims were dressed in barber capes and sat in parlour chairs when they were shot in the head just after 5pm on Tuesday.
Yamen Alchoum fears he narrowly missed being in the wrong place at the wrong time
The city centre was busy at the time as commuters made their way to the nearby train station and students from the city's prestigious university cycled back to their flats.
Witnesses reported hearing loud bangs which many mistook for fireworks. Minutes later several police cars and an ambulance arrived, blocking the street and forcing a bus to turn around. Helicopters and drones were dispatched to try and track down the suspect. Local media reported that he had worn a mask and used an electric scooter to get away from the scene.
""I heard the helicopters, so then I knew that something had happened,"" says Sara, a 32-year-old who lives on the street. She says her phone quickly lit up with news notifications and texts from friends asking if she was okay.
Around two hours after the shootings, police arrested a 16-year-old boy. In Sweden, suspects can be held based on different levels of suspicion, and the teenager was initially held at the second-highest level, indicating strong suspicion.
However, by Friday, prosecutors said the case against him had weakened and he was released.
On Saturday, Swedish police confirmed that six people have now been arrested in connection with the case. The suspects range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office, and one is suspected of carrying out the killings.
People intending to visit Uppsala for the Walpurgis festival were advised not to change their plans, as police promised extra resources on the cathedral city's streets and suggested the shooting was likely an ""isolated incident"".
While many were shaken, tens of thousands of Swedes still heeded their advice, packing the banks of Uppsala's Fyris river to watch the annual student raft race, drinking in the city's pubs and parks or heading to a huge public bonfire in the evening. Others joined the annual spring ceremony outside the university where current and former students gathered to wave white caps.
""I don't really feel so scared,"" says Alvin Rose, 19, a social studies student, having a snack in Vaksala Square, just around the corner from where the shootings happened. ""It feels like there's more security, more cops about.""
Alvin Rose says he's noticed more security since the attack
His friend Kassandra Fritz, an 18-year-old natural sciences student, says she has driven to Uppsala from her home in GÃ¤vle, two hours north, to ""have fun and meet new people"".
She reflects that she no longer has a ""strong"" reaction to news about shootings in Sweden since they are frequently in the headlines. ""There's been so many shootings lately, not only here in Uppsala but like, everywhere in Sweden.""
Over the past decade, Sweden has emerged as a European hotspot for gun crime, often linked to criminal networks. Research, external for Sweden's National Council for Crime Prevention released last year concluded that the profile of perpetrators is ""increasingly younger"", with growing numbers of teenagers both carrying out or dying from gun violence.
Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson was on a work trip to Valencia when the Uppsala shooting took place, but has since described it as ""an extremely violent act"".
""This underlines that the wave of violence is not over - it continues,"" he said in an interview with Swedish news agency TT on Wednesday.
At a news conference the day after, officers said they were investigating the possibility that the deaths were linked to gang crime, but said it was too soon to confirm this.
Police have been investigating whether the deaths are linked to gang crime
Police, external in various Swedish cities have previously said it is becoming more common for gangs to contract vulnerable children to carry out crimes, because those who are 15 or younger are below the age of criminal responsibility in Sweden.
Sweden's government recently proposed controversial new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children, in an attempt to prevent them from being recruited to teenage gangs.
Ministers have also said they want to tighten the country's gun laws.
In February, 10 people were killed in the country's worst mass shooting at an adult education centre in the Swedish town of Orebro. In this case, police suspect a 35-year-old was behind the killings. He legally owned a weapon, and was found dead inside the building.
Young people have been leaving flowers on the street corner near the salon
Outside the hair salon in Uppsala, 20-year-old Yamen says he has never been involved in gang crime but knows plenty of others who have.
""Many times in my school, there was gang violence, and in the streets - dealers,"" he says. ""But my personality was to work, study, and now I am in college.""
As he leaves to meet friends, a steady stream of young people continue to stop at the street corner next to the hairdressers, some bringing bouquets of flowers. Several appear visibly shaken and have tears in their eyes.
""I knew him very well,"" says Elias, a 16-year-old who says he was friends with one of the victims, and has asked the BBC not to share his surname. ""It feels unreal, you know. It doesn't feel like I've truly accepted the situation."""

It was his last push, not just to win, but also to get the majority he said he needed to stand up to the chaotic territorial and trade ambitions of his ""neighbour to the south"".
For someone who had got to see Carney as a cerebral technocrat, a crisis-managing central bank governor a decade ago, the transformation into public orator was quite something. 
I recall endless interviews trying to get the then governor to say something newsworthy, or something that would make a good headline. 
While this was a very different Mark Carney, the lineage in crisis economics was also part of his sell. 
Carney told his audience in Edmonton, Alberta, sporting the local Oilers hockey shirt: ""President Trump has ruptured the global economy... America's leadership of the global economy is over. It's still in play, but it is a tragedy, and our new realityâ¦ in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win"". 
His supporters shouted ""Elbows Up"" and put them up, a reference to a stand up and fight back posture in the occasionally rough game of ice hockey. 
""What we are seeing around the country is Canadians acting on behalf of other Canadians, standing up for each other, buying from each other, travelling here...""
At his very final stop in the far West, in the isolation of Victoria, Vancouver Island, with only half an hour of campaigning allowed, Carney went ""unplugged"" among supporters.
""As the assembled media will tell you, I campaigned in prose,"" Carney joked. ""So I'm going to govern in econometrics,"" he said of the nerdy mathematical strain of economics.
In normal circumstances, some of this might be interesting to the wider world. In current circumstances, the origins of his election win, his approach to policy making, and the nature of his mandate, could assume critical importance.
When I caught up with him for the BBC exclusive interview, just as the polls were closing on Monday, he appeared confident but was taking nothing for granted.

Mr Carney's central argument remained consistent. He said he was the leader to take on Donald Trump's ""betrayal"" and threats to Canada's economy and sovereignty.
It was exemplified by his final large rally on the US-Canada border, with the Ambassador Bridge and a skyline of iconic Detroit motoring firms behind him. 
This bridge is the main artery of Canadian-US trade. A lot of effort went into this backdrop of the two-way trade of the most integrated economies in the world, now tariffed at unimaginable levels. An unsubtle message from the Liberal Party leader, about a changed continent.
The election result was staggering. 
Entering 2025, the Liberal Party was as low as 16%, versus 45% for the opposition Conservatives, in opinion polls. 
Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives were not just heading for victory, but for a total landslide. 
But then following President Trump's imposition of national security tariffs on Canada, using the pretext of an alleged role in fentanyl traffic, and then his undiplomatic suggestion that Canada should join the USA, the polls tightened. 
Then after Mark Carney was elected Liberal leader, just eight weeks ago, the Liberals achieved a consistent poll lead, which they rode to victory last week.
The election became a presidential-style verdict on who could cope with Trump. 
Poilievre was fundamentally weakened by previous overtures to the US president and his style of government. 
Carney incorporated voters on the left who were scared of a Conservative government amplified by Trump. 
And incredibly, in Quebec, the Liberals won back support from separatists, who were more concerned about Canada's independence from the US, than their own constitutional status within Canada. There is nothing more unifying than a credible external threat.

Carney gave some clues to his strategy during his interview with me. He talked of a ""win win"" partnership with the US, and reminded the president that Canada was the ""biggest client"" of 40 of the 50 US states, and a key energy and fertiliser supplier. 
He also told me he ""potentially could supply them with critical minerals"". This struck me as a negotiation tactic very targeted at what Trump has become fixated on elsewhere. 
Canada has ample resources of critical minerals, and would be a much more dependable supplier across the West than many other nations. Carney is implicitly suggesting, however, that his country has deep strategic choices to make here, on for example, developing them with Europe rather than the US.
In any event, the PM will use the impetus of external threat to try to transform the Canadian economy. Even in the granting of an interview to BBC News, it was clear that he sees a critical need to diversify trade and strategic alliances. Defence partnerships are now on the cards. 
He seemed to acknowledge that a stalled Canada-UK trade deal could be expedited.
On Friday he pulled off the historic announcement that King Charles would reopen the Canadian parliament in person at the end of the month. This has not happened since 1977. It is entirely in keeping with Canada's constitution, but it is also a stunning assertion of enduring independence from the White House.
All roads now lead to the G7 Summit hosted by Carney in the middle of June in Alberta, bringing together the world's seven largest economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system.
Assuming that Trump comes, it will occur within days of the expiry of the pause in massive so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" on most of the world. 
It is often forgotten that if Canada and Mexico free themselves from the fentanyl tariffs, they will then, according to White House advisers, find themselves subject to this system, with a minimum of 10% tariffs.
All of this occurs within days of some growing frustration from America's traditional allies with the entire ""trade deal"" process. 
Japan is increasingly frustrated, with its finance minister now openly pointing to Japan's unbeaten holding of US government debt as a ""card"" in negotiations. 
The EU has not got very far. Even the UK has hinted that a deal with Europe may be a more effective way of boosting the economy.
It comes as tariffs are starting to have a visible and tangible negative impact on US businesses and consumers.
There is no great incentive to offer much up, while the US itself starts to feel the inevitable inflationary consequences of its actions. 
The flotilla of empty Chinese cargo ships and empty docks on the US West Coast will soon be seen in the economic data of an already shrinking US economy.
As a veteran of economic crises arising from the uncertain experiments of governments, Carney might be uniquely placed on how these situations pan out. Many in the markets have been thoroughly unimpressed with the White House advisers sent out to reassure investors in recent weeks.
But Carney too has his own challenges. He just missed out on a majority in parliament, but has chosen to try to project this as a virtue. 
He will reach across the aisle for a ""Team Canada"" approach to talks with the US. 
The Premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, who is a regular visitor to Mar-a-Lago, immediately announced moves to make separation referendums easier.
This is a very complicated, domestic, continental and global environment economically and politically. Few would predict exactly where it goes. Carney may have a very large part in it, and not just for his own country."
716,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn7x3v5d1y4o,2025-05-03 23:26:32,"Europe marks VE Day with Trump on its mind,","Parisian women smile in May 1945 after Germany's capitulation was signed the previous day
""Celebration? What celebration? It feels more like a funeral"" - the damning words of a former senior Nato figure to describe this week's ceremonies marking Victory in Europe Day.
The top-level diplomat who spent years at the transatlantic defence alliance asked not to be named in order to speak freely, but why so nihilistic? VE Day was a joint Allied triumph over Nazi Germany; over hatred, dictatorship, the Third Reich's territorial expansionism and heinous crimes against humanity.
So much blood was spilled achieving that victory. Some 51 million Allied soldiers and civilians died during World War Two, united in a pursuit to rid the world of the scourge of Nazism.
But 80 years on, we're surrounded by countless news and academic analyses breathlessly singling out Donald Trump as the modern day nail in the coffin of the strong transatlantic bonds forged back then. In Europe, the American president is viewed by many as the slayer-in-chief of decades-old common values; shared visions of security, democracy and rule of law.
But is that accurate, or too simplistic?
To get the full picture on what happened to allied ties after WW2, we cannot omit Russia, then or now.
By 1945, about 24 million Russians and other Soviets had been slaughtered in the war with Germany. Without their sacrifice, as well as that of the other allies, the Nazis would not have been vanquished.
""One thing we need to recognise, though, is Russia was never a true friend of the West,"" says Michael Zantovsky, a former Czech Ambassador to Washington and to London.
""During WW2 it was an ally for existential reasons. It needed any help [against the Nazis] that it could get. And it was the same story with western powers, to be fair. They needed the help of the Soviet Union. But Russia did not plan on continuing the alliance after the war. As soon as the threat of Nazi Germany was destroyed, the Soviet Union intended to follow its own objectives.""
Splits appeared the moment Germany was defeated; there was even a disagreement over which day VE Day fell. Western powers witnessed the signing of Germany's military capitulation in the French cathedral city of Reims, news that broke on 8 May 1945. The USSR wanted its own, separate, signing with surrendering Germany in Soviet-occupied Berlin a day later. Russia marks VE Day on 9 May to this day.
Depending where you are in Europe on VE Day, the mood is varied - particularly this year.
Western Europe welcomes liberty, democracy and an end to the Nazi threat. In the UK for example, multiple VE Day celebrations are planned this year, as with every year.
But people living in central and eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, emerged from Nazi occupation in 1945 only to end up under Communist regimes - whether they liked it or not.
As a result, Ambassador Zantovsky describes his country's relationship to VE Day as ""ambiguous"".
""The western part of Czechoslovakia was liberated by US troops, the rest of the country by Soviet soldiers,"" he tells me.
Czechoslovakia was taken over by the Communist Party in 1948 and fully invaded by the Soviet Union two decades later. ""During communist times, the West's role in WW2 was deliberately suppressed and marginalised. We were told we owed our liberty [from the Nazis] to the Soviets.""
Russia marks VE Day with triumphalist military parades - and President Vladimir Putin knows the deep sense of nationalist pride that Russians still feel at defeating the Nazi regime in 1945. It is no coincidence that he publicly labels Ukraine's leadership ""Nazis"" as a means of besmirching them in Russian eyes.
A Ukraine activist is seen here at a VE Day gathering in Germany in 2023 
For VE Day this year, President Putin called a three-day ceasefire with Ukraine â it's presumed, because he wants to concentrate, uninterrupted, on showing off Russia's military muscle in front of a crowd of foreign dignitaries, including President Xi Jinping of China.
The official reason Putin gave for the Ukraine ceasefire was ""humanitarian grounds"". Quite the irony, since he's the one who ordered the invasion of that sovereign country.
That invasion brought back difficult memories for Czechs of their own occupation and suppression. ""That's why we feel so strongly for Ukraine,"" says Zantovsky.
""It's only a few hundred kilometres away. Our sense of security is threatened once again.""
This is why most Europeans are so shocked at President Trump's apparent respect for, even deference towards, Putin, while simultaneously verbally threatening the territorial integrity of traditionally close allies like Canada and Denmark.
Europe has viewed the US as its closest friend since WW2. Washington poured money into the war-shattered continent in the late 1940s - including West Germany, which was ever thankful to the US for bringing it back into the fold after the horrors of Nazism. The US also gave Europe post-war security guarantees; Nato was founded in 1949.
But this wasn't American altruism, as Trump implies. It too was a marriage of convenience, of sorts.
Following WW2, the US worried about the spread of communism. It fretted that Europe, with its economy and infrastructure in tatters, was vulnerable both to home-grown communist parties and abroad from an expansionist Soviet Union. By swooping in to help rebuild Europe, the US was gaining a geostrategic foothold on the Soviet Union's doorstep throughout the Cold War.
The idea of a ""West"" - made of countries sharing security goals and values - was born.
The West is grappling with a new reality while Russia's war continues
Might we now be witnessing its death, or gradual strangulation? With no common enemy anymore, the friendship is certainly fraying. In 2025, the president of the United States no longer feels threatened by Russia.
""Shared history served as the foundation for the (transatlantic) relationship for eight decades, but it's not enough to propel the relationship forward anymore,"" Washington's former Nato ambassador Julie Smith told me.
The war in Ukraine is the biggest conflict in Europe since WW2. With Russia's economy resolutely on a war footing, it has the potential to spread.
Europe, unlike the US, still feels threatened by Russia. Capitals across the continent have been left speechless and nervous by Trump appearing to blame Ukraine, not Moscow, for the bloodshed.
The televised press conference in the White House Oval Office in late February, where Trump and his deputy, JD Vance, seemingly tried to bait, berate and humiliate Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, was a turning point in European public opinion and politics.
A YouGov poll in March indicated that, 80 years on from VE Day, a large majority of Western Europeans (78% in the UK, 74% in Germany, 75% in Spain) now view the White House as a big threat to peace and security in Europe.
In Europe's east, the Soviet Union's former sphere of influence, people fear President Trump's attitude to Ukraine will only embolden President Putin in his expansionist drive.
If Russia gets US recognition for ""crimes of conquest"" in Ukraine, says historian and author Timothy Garton Ash, VE Day this year would be better labelled DE Day - Defeat in Europe Day.
And with Trump frequently accusing Europe of free-loading, and taking advantage of the US, there's a nervousness among leaders across the continent that they could be left alone to defend themselves for the first time since WW2. Boosting defence spending is now a huge topic in European capitals.
The message Berlin has taken from Trump's first 100 days in office is: ""We cannot rely on the US anymore,"" says Peter Wittig, Germany's former ambassador to Washington.
That's a massive turnaround for Germans, who have been reluctant to rebuild their country's military might after WW2. Instead, Germany leant particularly heavily on the US for its security. A large chunk of the estimated 100,000 US troops stationed in Europe are based in Germany. The US stores nuclear arms in the country too.
The Trump-shock among normally pro-US German politicians is so profound that it prompted a change in the country's constitution this spring. Parliamentarians voted to lift Berlin's long established debt brake - which limited government spending - in order to invest heavily and power up the country's military going forward.
Ursula von der Leyen, once Germany's defence minister, is now the president of the European Commission in Brussels. She is transatlantic-leaning and carefully-spoken, but even she summed up the present situation starkly: ""The West as we knew it, no longer exists.""
London is preparing for VE Day - but some in Europe feel less jubilant this year
Still, the pivot away from Europe by the US cannot just be blamed on Trump.
China, not Russia, has been viewed by the White House as strategic threat number one for some time now. In 2012, then-US President Barack Obama said he wanted to focus his foreign policy on Asia, and Trump's predecessor Joe Biden invested a lot of time trying to shore up China-wary allies in the Indo-Pacific.
Trump or no Trump, concentrating foreign policy on Asia and withdrawing substantially from Europe is unlikely to change, says Ambassador Wittig - whichever political party wins the next US election - especially as there is now a growing reluctance in US public opinion to carry the burden of financing allies.
Wittig calls it ""the end of an era - the end of engagement in Europe"".
Despite all the European hand wringing, there is a recognition among the continent's leaders that, 80 years after VE Day, it is high time they take more responsibility for paying and providing for their own defence capabilities, rather than relying on Washington.
Some also see potential in the relationship reset. Ambassador Zantovsky calls this ""an opportunity brought about by crisis, a sense of urgency regarding security that hasn't existed [in Europe] for the last 30 years"".
Perhaps, but during the Cold War western European societies had younger populations and far more slim-line welfare states. Spending 4% or 5% of gross domestic product on defence was do-able.
Analysts say that's what would be needed again now to wean Europe off US security support, but it's unclear if present-day voters would accept the painful compromises needed - in terms of cuts in government spending on health or education for example - in return for boosting their country's defence capabilities. 
This is especially the case in European nations geographically further from Russia's orbit, where the sense of immediate threat feels less acute.
Mr Garton Ash wonders if there is a transitional path from the current US-led Nato to a more European Nato, with the US still at the table but Europe taking responsibility for its own security.
""We need a new generation of political leaders who are up to the challenge,"" says political historian and biographer Sir Anthony Seldon.
""A need can often bring forward the right people,"" he added, reflecting on European and US leaders in the aftermath of WW2.
""Something has certainly broken. The future is uncertain. Do we have to go to war periodically to realise how terrible it is, and to force us to work together?""
Eight decades on from the hell they experienced, surviving WW2 veterans would tell you they fervently hope that won't be the case."

Official vote counting won't finish for days, but Albanese's centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.
""Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need,"" Albanese said.
Coalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted ""full responsibility"" for his party's loss and apologised to his MPs.
Following the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.
Cost-of-living concerns - particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing - dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.  
Dutton was seen by many as Australia's Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration. 
Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told BBC Newshour that Dutton ran a ""very Trumpian campaign"", and the US president was ""the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived"" the Liberal-National opposition.
Labor saw swings towards them right across the country â a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia - and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.
The party's success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.
Labor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.
That represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most ""teal"" independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.
It's a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albanese's popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.
Anthony Albanese says his election was a vote for equality and kindess
In his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the election's key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy. 
He reiterated his promises to make healthcare - most critically GP appointments - more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.
Notably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: ""We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.""
It's a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albanese's tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.
Australia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.
The Voice was one of Albanese's most defining policies, and his most striking setback - it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.
Indigenous Australians have told the BBC  they feel like they've been forgotten by policymakers since.
The prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.
With tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the ""incumbency curse"" â a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.
Dutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback - he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.
It has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University  Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: ""Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.""
Instead tonight Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labor's Ali France.
Peter Dutton is one of the opposition's most experience MPs
""I love this country and have fought hard for it,"" he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.
""We have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.""
His campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameraman's head.
""The opposition has been shambolic,"" Prof Warhurst says.
But the government - while resolute and disciplined in its campaign - was timid. It's strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.
And that's something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.
While the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.
Last election, analysts and some of the party's own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton â a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man â was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.
After a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are ""Trumpian"" politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again â and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.
""We have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review... we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election,"" former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.
But meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.
Albanese's ""incumbency curse"" turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.
Labor struck a ""middle-of-the-road path"" with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.
""That was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: 'Will Labor actually do something with power?'"""

The owner of an outdoor museum in County Donegal has described a fire which damaged multiple buildings on the land as a ""disaster"". 
GardaÃ­ (Irish police) and fire services attended the scene of the blaze at Doagh Famine Village in Ballyliffin, on the Inishowen peninsula, at approximately 16:00 local time on Saturday. 
A number of people were on the land when the fire broke out, but no one was injured.
The fire has been extinguished and foul play is not suspected. 
The Doagh Famine Village tells the story of an Irish family living through famine times up until the present day. 
Pat Doherty, owner of Doagh Famine Village, lived with his family in one of the thatched dwellings, which is now on display in the outdoor museum, until 1984. 
Speaking to BBC News NI on Saturday evening, Mr Doherty said: ""We show (visitors) how we lived up until the '80s, how we fished, how we farmed and how we survived here.""
Mr Doherty said the Doagh Famine Village project began in 1997. 
""Every year there was a bit added onto it and it grew like that. It ends today now,"" he said. 
""It's a disaster.""
The Doagh Famine Village project began in 1997
A replica of an Orange Hall and a safe house which displayed information on the peace process were destroyed in the fire. 
Items about the Travelling community, including caravans, were also burnt. 
""Some of those things can never be replaced,"" Mr Doherty said, adding that many items were donations. 
""Half of the centre is now destroyed."" 
The museum has been shut down for the foreseeable as a result of the fire. 
During a visit to the museum, visitors could learn about the peace process in Northern Ireland, from various viewpoints. 
The process of making poitÃ­n - a strong, clear alcoholic spirit - was also shown at the museum. 
Mr Doherty credited the fire service for their response to the blaze. 
""We owe a lot to the fire brigade."""

Swedish police have arrested six people in connection with a suspected triple murder at a hair salon in the city of Uppsala.
Those arrested range in age from under 18 to 45, according to the state prosecutor's office. One is suspected of carrying out the killings on Tuesday evening.
A 16-year-old who had been arrested hours after the incident was released on Friday.
The three victims shot dead in the salon were between the ages of 15 and 20. The attack came on the eve of the Walpurgis spring festival, when large crowds descended on the streets of Uppsala.
Police are investigating the possibility that the shooting was related to gang crime.
The father of one of the victims told state-run broadcaster SVT on Saturday that his 15-year-old son had asked him to transfer money so he could have a haircut ahead of the Walpurgis celebrations. That was the last he heard from his son.
""He was a really nice boy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could have happened to anyone,"" the father said.
One of those killed was reportedly known to the police, local media said.
The victim was involved in a police investigation over a planned attack against a relative of gang leader Ismail Abdo, according to the reports. The person was never charged.
Uppsala, a university town north of Stockholm, has long been the base of Abdo and rival gang leader Rawa Majida.
A new chapter in their turf wars began in 2023, when Abdo's mother was murdered at her home.
Sweden has seen a wave of teenage gang crime in recent years, with suspects accused of a range of offences from vandalism to murder.
The Swedish government has proposed new legislation that would allow police to wiretap children under the age of 15 in an attempt to grapple with the problem."

Eight others were injured when a Dodge Ram pickup truck and a Mercedes passenger van carrying 14 sightseers crashed on a highway in eastern Idaho, said US police. Both vehicles caught fire. 
Five Chinese tourists died in the Mercedes van, according to Chinese state media. Idaho State Police say 12 Chinese and one Italian citizen were aboard the bus when the crash occurred. 
Police are still investigating the cause. The route where the crash took place leads into the park, which is now entering peak tourist season. 
""Tragically, six individuals in the van and the driver of the pickup died as a result of the crash,"" Idaho State Police (ISP) said on Friday.
Five of the dead are citizens of China, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the Chinese consulate in San Francisco.
""The consulate expressed deep condolences for the dead and sincere sympathy to the injured and the families of those affected,"" Xinhua reported.
It added that Chinese officials had been in contact with the injured and the families of victims, and had asked US officials for a thorough investigation.
Fremont County coroner Brenda Dye told the New York Times that two victims were from Italy, though this has not been confirmed by police.
Police have identified Isaiah Moreno, 25, of Texas, as the driver of the pickup truck. No other victims' identities have yet been disclosed.
Moreno was the sole occupant of the pickup truck, a spokesman for ISP told the BBC in an email on Saturday.
The driver of the tourist van was licensed in California, according to police.
""Next-of-kin notifications are ongoing and coordinated with appropriate local and international authorities,"" ISP said in a statement.
""Due to the international nature of those involved, the process is complex and will take additional time.""
The statement added that ISP ""continue to work closely"" with Ctour Holiday LLC, which arranged the tour, and the consulates of China and Italy. 
Idaho Governor Brad Little posted on X to say that he was praying for victims, and that his state was ""working closely with local officials to get answers on what led to this terrible tragedy"".
Police said an air ambulance flew some victims to hospital ""due to the severity of the injuries"".
A photo from a passerby near Yellowstone shows flames and billowing smoke near the wreck of the truck.
The witness who took the photo, local resident Roger Merrill, said he was on his way home when he saw the wreck. 
Both vehicles were on fire, he said, and bystanders were trying to care for the survivors on the side of the highway.
""It is a very dangerous highway because it leads to the main entrance of Yellowstone National Park,"" he said. ""It's extremely busy.""
The road was closed for seven hours while emergency teams treated victims and cleared the crash site, about 16 miles (25km) from Yellowstone's entrance.

Singapore's ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has won by a landslide in an election dominated by concerns over the cost of living and the country's future economic stability.
Led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in his first election since he became party leader last year, the PAP clinched 65.6% of the vote and an overwhelming majority of the 97 seats in parliament.
Singaporeans went to the polls on Saturday worrying about inflation, wage stagnation and job prospects.
The result will be widely seen as a flight to safety to the PAP amid fears of global turbulence.
""Singapore feels particularly vulnerable given its economy's size and exposure to international forcesâ¦ Also we are notoriously risk-averse voters,"" said Ian Chong, an associate professor in political science at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
The main opposition, the centre-left Workers' Party (WP), failed to capture more seats but continued to hold on to its 10 seats in parliament.
The centre-right PAP has governed Singapore continuously since 1959, making it one of the longest-ruling political parties in the world.
It has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations that have seen the country flourish under PAP rule.
But while elections have been free from fraud and irregularities, critics also say the party maintains an unfair advantage through gerrymandering and a tightly controlled media.
In the last three polls prior to Saturday's result, the PAP saw two of its lowest-ever vote shares, while the WP made increasing inroads in parliament.
The PAP won a reduced majority in the 2020 election, in what was seen as a referendum on their handling of the Covid outbreak.
But Saturday's result saw the PAP return to form, as voters gave Wong a strong mandate.
In a televised address early on Sunday, he thanked voters and said the results ""will put Singapore in a better position to face this turbulent world"".
""Many are watching the election closely, whether it's international media, investors or foreign governments, they would have taken note of tonight's results,"" he said.
""It's a clear signal of trust, stability and confidence in your government. Singaporeans, too, can draw strength from this and look ahead to our future.""
The PAP has enjoyed strong support from Singaporeans, particularly from older generations
While its open and globalised economy remains fairly buoyant, Singapore saw inflation surge in the last few years. 
The government has attributed this to external factors such as the Ukraine and Gaza wars and supply chain disruptions. Critics however say a controversial goods and services tax hike exacerbated it.
With the US-China trade war under way and a 10% US tariff looming, authorities and experts have warned of shocks to the economy and possibly a technical recession.
Against this backdrop, the PAP campaigned on a message of stability.
Wong repeatedly promised that his team would ""steer Singapore through the storm"", while warning that if more opposition MPs were elected, he would lose capable ministers at a time when good governance was most needed.
It was a message that resounded with many voters. One PAP supporter, a start-up owner who only wanted to be known as Amanda, told the BBC that her business has been affected with clients pausing some projects due to the economic climate.
""The headwinds are not great, there's a lot of uncertaintyâ¦ I want a party with experience [running the government],"" she said.
Though the PAP saw a series of scandals in recent years, including one involving a cabinet minister, this was hardly a talking point during the election period. Analysts said it was further from people's minds given more immediate concerns about the economy.
Many Singaporeans have been concerned about the rising cost of living
Some see the result as a sign of confidence in Wong, who led Singapore's Covid taskforce and became a familiar face as he regularly addressed the public during the pandemic.
""He's shown that he is capable, with the Covid taskforce giving him credence. He was the guiding hand on that rudderâ¦ and he projects that stability for future global financial uncertainties,"" said Rebecca Tan, a political science lecturer with NUS.
Wong is the first PAP prime minister to have improved the party's vote share in his first election. Previous PMs saw dips in the polls in what analysts used to call the ""new PM"" effect"", or a reflection of voters' uncertainty in a new leader.
The PAP's strong result was also partly due to a fragmented opposition, with 10 parties going up against them. With few exceptions, most performed poorly.
Teo Kay Key, a research fellow at the think tank Institute of Policy Studies, said that despite recent elections showing there was a desire for political diversity, the latest result ""shows that people are happy with the number of opposition MPs"" for now.
But, she added, Singaporeans also ""seem to be more selective"" now when it comes to casting votes for the opposition, pointing to the WP's performance.
The WP had campaigned on a platform of lowering the cost of living and strengthening the safety net. 
While it failed to win more seats, it also saw increased vote shares in the constituencies it retained and close fights with the PAP in others, cementing its status as the country's strongest opposition party.
It turned in a robust performance despite recent controversial cases involving a former Workers' Party MP and WP leader Pritam Singh, who were both found guilty of lying to parliament. Many in the WP's support base believe the case, against Singh especially, was politically motivated.
Addressing supporters shortly after the results for his constituency were declared, Singh acknowledged that ""it was always going to be a difficult election"".
But he added: ""The slate is wiped clean, we start work again tomorrow, and we go again.""
Singapore's Workers' Party is led by Pritam Singh"

The Togolese leader, Faure GnassingbÃ©, has been sworn in as ""President of the Council of Ministers"" - a new post which is the highest office in the government's executive branch and has no official term limits.
This follows constitutional reform that ended presidential elections, and introduced a parliamentary system.
The opposition said the change was in order to allow President GnassingbÃ© to stay in power indefinitely.
His family has ruled the country for 58 years - Faure GnassingbÃ© took over in 2005 from his father, GnassingbÃ© EyadÃ©ma, who had ruled for almost four decades.
This latest change results from a new constitution approved by lawmakers last year, labelled by critics and opposition figures as an ""institutional coup d'Ã©tat"".
GnassingbÃ©'s government had paused some of the changes following huge backlash, but has moved ahead with his new role.
Togo's municipal elections in July will be the first under the new constitution, which has replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one.
In theory, the role of president of the republic is now only an honorary title, but analysts say GnassingbÃ©'s power is more entrenched than ever with his new post of council president.
His party, the Union for the Republic, won a huge majority in last year's parliamentary election, taking of 108 out of 113 seats in the National Assembly.

He defeated opposition leader Peter Dutton of the centre-right Liberal-National coalition. Dutton also lost his seat in Dickson, Queensland - one he had held for 24 years. 
It is a remarkable turnaround for Albanese, 62, whose popularity was at record lows at the start of the year as Australians grappled with a cost of living crisis and challenges in healthcare and housing.
US President Donald Trump's global tariff policy, which did not spare Australia, was also on voters' minds.
It is a remarkable turnaround for 62-year-old Albanese
Here's a look at how that played out in charts, based on an unofficial count by Australian broadcaster ABC:
Albanese needed at least 76 seats in the House of Representatives to form a government.
Before the dissolution of parliament, Labor had a razor-thin majority of 77 seats.
With some 70.8% of the seats already counted, the ABC puts Labor on track to finish with 85 seats - far above the 76 seats needed, giving it a comfortable majority. 
The Coalition is expected to gain 36 seats and the Independents stand at 10. 
Here's a reminder of what the seats in the House of Representatives looked like before tonight's results. 
Current projections mean Labor has so far claimed 34.7% of first-preference votes, with the Coalition trailing behind at 31.7%.
The Greens stand at 12.2% of first-preference votes. 
As compared to the 2022 election, its clear Labor has increased its share of the national vote, with an increase of 2.1% so far - though that number could increase as counting goes on.
Official vote counting won't conclude for days but its clear that the Labor government is set to dramatically increase its majority - with swings towards them in almost every area."

He signed off by providing his expertise for the 2025 Australian federal election.  
Since 1991 he has been involved with around 90 Australian elections as well as polls in the UK, New Zealand and Canada. 
The ABC's federal election night coverage recognised his exit with a special send-off. 
Speaking on the eve of the federal election, he said it was the right time to stop as he had recently turned 65 and would ""rather do without all the pressure of the broadcast"".
Paying tribute to his work on-air, ABC presenter Sarah Ferguson said Green had pioneered the way elections are covered in Australia.
""A big thanks for helping Australians understand how our complex elections work,"" she said.
In a video package, Australian leaders past and present called him the ""GOAT"" and a ""legend"".
""Antony Green is to election analysis and election results rather like Tina Turner to rugby league - simply the best,"" said the nation's second-longest serving prime minister John Howard.
Green first took up a six-month contract as an election researcher for the ABC's 1990 election coverage. He beat 150 other candidates and said he thought he was chosen due to his computer skills. 
He ended up being kept on and a year later he would make his first appearance on air.

Memorable moments 
The 1993 federal election was the first to use the ABC's election computer system, which Green helped to design and has been instrumental in updating ever since. 
That year saw dramatic results. John Hewson of the Coalition lost what had been described as the ""unlosable"" election at the time. 
Green noticed early on that there had been dramatic swings in the favour of the incumbent Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and interrupted a wildlife documentary to report on the developments.  
Less than three hours later he called the election, something he admitted made him ""quite famous"". 
It was a ""revelation to everyone"" to call the election so early, he added. 
Much-loved figure
Green has been described as an ""Australian institution and much-loved figure with the public"" by ABC's director of news, Justin Stevens. 
In 2017, Green was awarded the Order of Australia in Queen Elizabeth II's birthday honour's list. He was recognised for his service to broadcast as well as ""to the community as a key interpreter of Australian democracy"".
He has developed a cult-like status among some of the Australian public. 
He never expected his face to be found adorning t-shirts, mugs and other wares.  
The warmth of feeling is so strong among his ABC colleagues, one of the country's top presenters Leigh Sales wore one of the shirts to vote on election day. 
When asked about the merchandise, Green's retort was ""why aren't I getting any money out of this?""
The whole thing is ""a bit embarrassing"", he admitted.
One of Australia's top presenters Leigh Sales sports Antony Green merchandise 
The task of helping run election analysis is no mean feat. Green has amassed a book of notes for every election over the last 35 years. His archive will, he says, be deposited in the Australian National Library to be preserved.  
Is he feeling sentimental about his on-air departure? ""Not particularly,"" he said.
He will still be involved behind the scenes ""for a few more years"", however it will be limited to statistical modelling and computer modelling."

Dutton, the head of the Liberal-National coalition, had held the seat for 24 years and is the first federal opposition leader to lose his own seat.
France, 49, has been chipping away at Dutton's home base of Dickson for years.
In 2019, the former journalist, communications manager and para athlete won 45.4% of the vote in her maiden campaign. In 2022, her vote share went up to 48.3%.
France is the eldest daughter of former Queensland state minister Peter Lawlor and a single mother.
France, who lost her leg in an accident in 2011, said she was inspired to run for political office to advocate for people with disabilities.
France has campaigned for easing the cost of living through tax cuts, lower medicine costs, electricity rebates, expanded paid parental leave and investing in education and public healthcare.
Her eldest son Henry died from leukaemia in February 2024. She has one other son, Zac.
After announcing her candidacy last year, she said Henry would have been proud of her for running.
""Obviously, I'm incredibly sad that he is not here,"" France said at the time. ""But he said to me many times on many different issues: 'Don't make me the excuse for not doing the important things.' And this is so incredibly important.""
In his concession speech on Saturday, Dutton said: ""I told Ali her son Henry would be incredibly proud of her tonight, and she will do a good job as the local member.""
Australian PM wins second term with increased majority
Peter Dutton: The ex-cop who brought Australia's opposition back from the brink
France's family ""have relied heavily on Medicare and know investment in healthcare, cheaper medicines and ensuring access to GPS and specialists is incredibly important"", according to the Labor Party's website.
France had her leg amputated in May 2011 after an incident while she was pushing a pram holding her son Zac, who was four at the time, in the car park of a Brisbane shopping centre. 
A driver, aged 88, lost control of his car and pinned her against the front of another vehicle. She pushed the pram out of the way, and Zac did not suffer serious injuries.
France's femoral artery was severed and surgeons had to amputate her left leg from above the knee.
In 2019, Dutton apologised to France for suggesting she was using her disability as an ""excuse"" for not living in the Dickson electorate at the time.
France had been living in the neighbouring electorate and said she was looking for a wheelchair accessible home in Dickson.
The Labor Party website said France now lives in Arana Hills with her son."
729,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdxgwnj8v5eo,2025-05-03 13:49:03,"He wanted to be Australia's PM. But a 'Trump effect' thwarted Peter Dutton,","""It's not our night,"" Australia's opposition leader Peter Dutton told a roomful of supporters in Brisbane after his rival, Anthony Albanese, was re-elected as prime minister. 
It was indeed a bruising night for Dutton, a 54-year-old political veteran who also lost his parliamentary seat of 24 years to a candidate from Albanese's Labor Party. 
This is a big win for the prime minister, who made a surprising comeback to secure a comfortable majority for a second term. But it's an even bigger loss for Dutton and his Liberal National Coalition. 
Dutton initially seemed to have an advantage over the incumbent PM who was battling a cost-of-living crisis and dismal ratings. But that advantage vanished as the campaign wore on, ending in a humiliating defeat.
An awkward and inconsistent campaign that did not do enough to reassure voters was partly to blame. But there is no mistaking the big part played by what some have called the ""Trump effect"". 
Dutton, whether he liked it or not, was a man who many saw as Australia's Trump - but as it turns out Australians do not appear to want that. 
Dutton's brand of hard-line conservatism, his support for controversial immigration policies â like sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centres â and his fierce criticism of China, all led to comparisons with US President Donald Trump.
It's a likeness he has rejected but then the Coalition pursued policies that seemed to have been borrowed from the Trump administration.
Dutton said that if elected he would cut public sector jobs - more than 40,000 by some estimates. This reminded voters of billionaire Elon Musk's Doge, or Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed US bureaucracy. Dutton later walked back the plan. 
The Coalition even appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency. And images of her wearing a cap with the words Maga - short for the popular Trump slogan, Make America Great Again - have become a key talking point.  
Peter Dutton conceded defeat on Saturday night 
None of this served Dutton well and he knew it. Towards the end of the campaign, he tried to shake off Trump's shadow, and in the final leaders' debate he repeatedly told the audience that he didn't know Trump before attempting to answer questions on him.
""The Coalition will probably regret issuing messages that came across as supporting Trump and opposing the US Democrats,"" said Frank Mols, a political science lecturer at the University of Queensland. 
""Once the stock markets started to drop in response to the uncertainty created by the [Trump's] tariffs, it became harder for the Coalition to profile itself as a safer pair of hands for the economy.""
The talk of trade wars and tariffs increased voters' worries. Speaking to people across Australia â the BBC travelled to Perth in Western Australia and Melbourne in the final week of campaigning â it was clear that global politics only became more important through the campaign.
Australia has long balanced its military alliance with the US and its economic relationship with China, its biggest trading partner. 
But a US-China trade war, along with an unpredictable White House, is tricky territory for any country - even a US ally like Australia. 
Could Dutton provide stability in these unusual times?  
Dutton had long tried to convince voters that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with Trump. He often cited his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term.
Dutton lost his seat of 24 years to Labor's Ali France, a former para-athlete and disability advocate 
But in the end voters weren't convinced. 
Dutton's own inconsistent policies and the Trump-esque rhetoric and decisions appear to have driven away an electorate that is deeply concerned about a new, tumultuous world order.
""Our message was confusing... Labor had a tight and very disciplined campaign,"" Jitendra Prasad, a LNP supporter, told the BBC as he was about to leave the watch party on Saturday night after a disappointing outcome. 
That was evident in the swings towards Labor across the country, which led to a fairly quick, emphatic result. 
Towards the end of the campaign, Dutton also embraced the right-wing One Nation Party, which some Coalition members had warned was the wrong move. And it didn't seem to have helped. Rather, it may have hurt him. 
""They just read the rooms incorrectly,"" says Ben Wellings, associate professor of Politics and International Relations at Monash University.
""It was one of the things that we always say about the electorate in Australia  - it's a small C conservative and maybe the radical right message was just in the end, too radical and seemed too disruptive.""
What also didn't help was that Dutton's was never a smooth campaign. 
There were gaffes, such as when he accidentally hit a cameraman with a football, and costly missteps, like getting the price of a carton of eggs wrong during an election debate - his guess (A$4.20) was, in fact, half the actual price.
It was not a good look in an election where cost-of-living has been a dominant theme.
""Dutton has seemed more comfortable attacking Labor than presenting a strong alternative,"" says Jacob Broom, a lecturer in politics and policy at Murdoch University in Perth.
""I think it has been effective for Labor to point to the Liberals voting against cost-of-living measures like the tax cuts which they proposed toward the end of the term.""
While Dutton criticised Labour's tax relief measures and spending, he then announced that he would also effect tax rebates and big spends, including billions to boost defence and fix an ailing public healthcare system.
But at the same time he also promised cuts. Analysts say this inconsistency confused voters and became an unfortunate theme in his campaign.
He announced and then walked back plans for huge changes to the bureaucracy, including job cuts and the plans to end work from home arrangements. He said it was ""a mistake"".
But ""the backflips on working from home and his uncertainty over public service cuts,"" complicated his message, according to John Warhurst, Emeritus Professor, Australian National University.
Voters and analysts say Dutton's campaign has been inconsistent   
The result, many believe, was the lack of a coherent campaign. 
""I think people couldn't understand Dutton's policies,"" a member of Dutton's own party in his Dickson constituency told the BBC earlier on Saturday. 
He wondered if Dutton's support for nuclear energy put people off - an issue that analysts such as Dr Mols said could have worked against him because Australian voters had not ""warmed up"" to the idea of nuclear energy.  
Ultimately, the biggest issue this election - cost-of-living - may have helped Labor cement its message that theirs was the steadier hand. 
Evanthia Smith, another voter in Dutton's Dickson seat, said she voted for Labor because she believed their candidate would do more to improve public education and access to healthcare.
Dutton acknowledged the huge loss the Coalition had faced: ""Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight, including in my electorate of Dickson... We'll rebuild from here."" 
It was the same advice a supporter in Brisbane had for the party: ""The party needs to go back to the drawing block and look at their policies. We need to focus on the typical issues: Housing, cost-of-living - they are the biggest."""

A court in Tunisia has sentenced former Prime Minister Ali Laarayedh to 34 years in prison on a raft of terrorism charges.
He is the latest high-profile critic of the president to be jailed as campaigners slam ""sham trials"" in the country.
The 69-year-old is a prominent opponent of President Kais Saied and leader of Ennadha, a moderate Islamist party that holds the largest number of seats in parliament.
Along with seven other people, Laarayedh was charged with setting up a terrorist cell and helping young Tunisians travel abroad to join Islamist fighters in Iraq and Syria.
""I am not a criminal... I am a victim in this case,"" he wrote in a letter to the court's prosecutor last month, according to the AFP news agency.
He was sentenced on Friday.
Laarayedh has consistently denied any wrongdoing and said the case was politically motivated.
In recent weeks, at least 40 critics of Tunisia's president have been sent to prison - including diplomats, lawyers and journalists.
Rights groups say these trials have highlighted Saied's authoritarian control over the judiciary, after dissolving parliament in 2021 and ruling by decree.
Since he was first elected six years ago, the former law professor has rewritten the constitution to enhance his powers.
Laarayedh was arrested three years ago and campaigners had called for his release - including Human Rights Watch, external, who said the affair seemed like ""one more example of President Saied's authorities trying to silence leaders of the Ennahda party and other opponents by tarring them as terrorists"".
Ennahdha governed the North African nation for a short while after a popular uprising dubbed the Arab Spring. 
The protest movement originated in Tunisia - where a vegetable-seller called Mohamed Bouazizi set fire to himself in despair of government corruption - and mass demonstrations soon spread across the wider region in 2011.
However many Tunisians say the democratic gains made have since been lost, pointing to the current president's authoritarian grip on power.
Yet President Saied has rejected criticism from inside and outside the country, saying he is fighting ""traitors"" and suffering ""blatant foreign interference"".

A Peruvian navy vessel has collided with an oil platform in the Amazon River, killing at least two people and leaving one missing.
The collision happened in the early hours of Friday morning at the junction of the Napo and Amazon rivers, causing ""severe damage"", Peru's defence ministry said.
Thirty crew members were rescued from the vessel, with specialised diving teams and helicopters deployed as part of the search operation, the statement added.
Anglo-French company Perenco, which owns the platform, said that the vessel had collided with the bow chain of the empty storage vessel. The Peruvian defence ministry said it was investigating the cause of the collision.
""Peru's Navy deeply regrets the irreparable loss of our crew members,"" the defence ministry said, adding that it would provide assistance to their loved ones.
The ministry said the vessel, called Ucayali, hit the platform while it was navigating near the mouth of the Napo River in northern Peru. 
In a statement, a spokesperson for Perenco told the BBC that ""at approximately 1.30am the Peruvian Navy's BAP Ucayali collided with the bow chain of the AF ManatÃ­, an empty Perenco storage vessel at permanent anchor"".

Five people have been rescued after spending 36 hours atop a plane in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after it was forced to make an emergency landing, local authorities said.
The small plane was found by local fishermen in Bolivia's Amazonas region on Friday having been missing for 48 hours.
The survivors - three women, a child and the 29-year-old pilot - were rescued in ""excellent condition"", Wilson Avila, director of the Beni Department's emergency operations centre, said.
A search and rescue mission was launched on Thursday after the plane disappeared from the radar of the Beni Department in central Bolivia.
The pilot told local media that an engine failure had prompted an emergency landing near the Itanomas River during a flight from Baures in northern Bolivia to the city of Trinidad.
Andres Velarde said that the plane had suddenly started to lose altitude and he had been forced to land the craft in a swamp near a lagoon.
The five that had been on board stood on top of the plane and were ""surrounded by alligators that came within three metres of us"".
Velarde added that he believed petrol leaking from the plane had kept the predators at bay. They also saw an anaconda in the water, he said.
While awaiting rescue, they ate local cassava flour one of the passengers had brought.
""We couldn't drink water and we couldn't go anywhere else because of the alligators,"" Velarde said.
Central and South America are home to caimans, a relative of alligators.
After fishermen discovered the craft, a helicopter was sent to transport the survivors to hospital.
Ruben Torres, Director of the Beni Region Health Department, said that there had been ""a lot of speculation about the case"" and ""many theories"" after the plane went missing.
""I am really happy because in the end all the institutions joined together to be able to find the missing people and save those lives,"" he told Reuters."

Brazil's Social Security Minister, Carlos Lupi, has resigned nine days after police unveiled a major corruption scandal which defrauded pensioners of $1.1bn (Â£829m).
Federal police allege that over the past decade, the National Social Security Institute (INSS) made unauthorised deductions from payments made to millions of pensioners. 
The money was allegedly paid to several associations and unions, which then shared the earnings with corrupt government officials. 
Lupi has always denied any wrongdoing and said he ordered an investigation as soon as he heard about the allegations.
""I am making this decision with the certainty that my name has not been mentioned at any time in the ongoing investigations,"" Lupi wrote on X when announcing his resignation.
""I hope that the investigations follow their natural course, identify those responsible and punish, with rigor, those who used their positions to harm the working people,"" he wrote.
Operation No Discount (Sem Desconto in Portuguese) has seen 700 federal agents issue 211 search warrants across Brazil, federal police said in a statement, external. 
Assets worth more than $177m have been seized - including luxury cars, jewellery and more than $200,000 in cash.
Police seized several luxury cars, including this Porsche, as well as Ferraris and a Rolls-Royce
The fraud allegedly involved registering pensioners as members of retirees' associations without their consent, but as a result they had money regularly deducted from their benefits for the memberships.
Police said the scheme targeted some of the poorest areas of the country, where pensioners were unlikely to notice the fraud or complain about it.
The head of the INSS resigned last week over the allegations, and six public servants have been removed from their posts, federal police said.
Investigators are focusing on more than 6bn real they believe was diverted between 2019-2024, but how much of that money was taken illegally remains unclear.
The INSS's director of budgets and finance, DÃ©bora Floriano, said a task force will will be set up to return the missing money, but at this stage they are still trying to determine the size of the fraud.
Carlos Lupi is the second person in President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government to lose their position due to corruption allegations in less than a month.
In early April, communications minister Juscelino Filho stepped down after he was charged with taking bribes in 2022.
Lula himself spent 1.5 years in prison in 2018-2019 for corruption, but the conviction was later thrown out, allowing him to run - and win - his third term as Brazil's president."

Last week's deadly militant attack in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which claimed 26 civilian lives, has reignited a grim sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu for India's security forces and diplomats.
This is familiar ground. In 2016, after 19 Indian soldiers were killed in Uri, India launched ""surgical strikes"" across the Line of Control â the de facto border between India and Pakistan - targeting militant bases.
In 2019, the Pulwama bombing, which left 40 Indian paramilitary personnel dead, prompted airstrikes deep into Balakot - the first such action inside Pakistan since 1971 - sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight.
And before that, the horrific 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives.
Each time, India has held Pakistan-based militant groups responsible for the attacks, accusing Islamabad of tacitly supporting them - a charge Pakistan has consistently denied.
Since 2016, and especially after the 2019 airstrikes, the threshold for escalation has shifted dramatically. Cross-border and aerial strikes by India have become the new norm, provoking retaliation from Pakistan. This has further intensified an already volatile situation.
Once again, experts say, India finds itself walking the tightrope between escalation and restraint - a fragile balance of response and deterrence. One person who understands this recurring cycle is Ajay Bisaria, India's former high commissioner to Pakistan during the Pulwama attack, who captured its aftermath in his memoir, Anger Management: The Troubled Diplomatic Relationship between India and Pakistan.
The 2019 Pulwama bombing, which killed 40 paramilitary personnel, triggered Indian airstrikes in Balakot, Pakistan
""There are striking parallels between the aftermath of the Pulwama bombing and the killings in Pahalgam,"" Mr Bisaria told me on Thursday, 10 days after the latest attack.
Yet, he notes, Pahalgam marks a shift. Unlike Pulwama and Uri, which targeted security forces, this attack struck civilians - tourists from across India - evoking memories of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. ""This attack carries elements of Pulwama, but much more of Mumbai,"" he explains.
""We're once again in a conflict situation, and the story is unfolding in much the same way,"" Mr Bisaria says.
A week after the latest attack, Delhi moved quickly with retaliatory measures: closing the main border crossing, suspending a key water-sharing treaty, expelling diplomats, and halting most visas for Pakistani nationals - who were given days to leave. Troops on both sides have exchanged intermittent small-arms fire across the border in recent days.
Delhi also barred all Pakistani aircraft - commercial and military - from its airspace, mirroring Islamabad's earlier move. Pakistan retaliated with its own visa suspensions and suspended a 1972 peace treaty with India. (Kashmir, claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but administered in parts by each, has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations since their partition in 1947.)

Ajay Bisaria (left) returned to Islamabad as India's high commissioner 22 days after the Pulwama attack
In his memoir, Mr Bisaria recounts India's response after the Pulwama attack on 14 February 2019. 
He was summoned to Delhi the morning after, as the government moved quickly to halt trade - revoking Pakistan's most-favoured-nation status, external, granted in 1996. In the following days, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) imposed a 200% customs duty on Pakistani goods, effectively ending imports, and suspended trade at the land border at  Wagah.
Mr Bisaria notes that a broader set of measures was also proposed to scale down engagement with Pakistan, most of which were subsequently implemented.
They included suspending a cross-border train known as the Samjhauta Express, and a bus service linking Delhi and Lahore; deferring talks between border guards on both sides and negotiations over the historic Kartarpur corridor to one of Sikhism's holiest shrines, halting visa issuance, ceasing cross border, banning Indian travel to Pakistan, and suspending flights between the two countries.
""How hard it was to build trust, I thought. And how easy was it to break it,"" Mr Bisaria writes.
""All the confidence-building measures planned, negotiated, and implemented over years in this difficult relationship, could be slashed off on a yellow notepad in minutes.""
The strength of the Indian high commission in Islamabad was reduced from 110 to 55 only in June 2020 after a separate diplomatic incident. (It now stands at 30 after the Pahalgam attack.) India also launched a diplomatic offensive. 
A day after the attack, then foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale briefed envoys from 25 countries - including the US, UK, China, Russia, and France - on the role of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), the Pakistan-based militant group behind the bombing, and accused Pakistan of using terrorism as state policy. JeM, designated a terrorist organisation by India, the UN, the UK, and the US, had claimed responsibility for the bombing. 
Indians in Mumbai celebrate the Balakot airstrike in February 2019
India's diplomatic offensive continued on 25 February, 10 days after the attack, pushing for JeM chief Masood Azhar's designation as a terrorist by the UN sanctions committee and inclusion on the EU's ""autonomous terror list"".
While there was pressure to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty - a key river water sharing agreement - India opted instead to withhold any data beyond treaty obligations, Mr Bisaria writes. A total of 48 bilateral agreements were reviewed for possible suspension. An all-party meeting was convened in Delhi, resulting in a unanimous resolution. 
At the same time, communication channels remained open - including the hotline between the two countries' Directors General of Military Operations (DGMO), a key link for military-to-military contact, as well as both high commissions. In 2019, as now, Pakistan said the attack was a ""false-flag operation"".
Much like this time, external a crackdown in Kashmir saw the arrest of over 80 ""overground workers"" - local supporters who may have provided logistical help, shelter, and intelligence to militants from the Pakistan-based group. Rajnath Singh, then Indian home minister, visited Jammu and Kashmir, and dossiers on the attack and suspected perpetrators were prepared.
In a meeting with the external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Mr Bisaria told her that ""that India's diplomatic options in dealing with a terrorist attack of this nature was limited"".
""She gave me the impression that some tough action was round the corner, after which, I should expect the role of diplomacy to expand,"" Mr Bisaria writes. 
On 26 February, Indian airstrikes - its first across the international border since 1971 - targeted JeM's training camp in Balakot.
Six hours later, the Indian foreign secretary announced the strikes had killed ""a very large number"" of militants and commanders. Pakistan swiftly denied the claim. More high-level meetings followed in Delhi.

The crisis escalated dramatically the next morning, 27 February, when Pakistan launched retaliatory air raids.
In the ensuing dogfight, an Indian fighter jet was shot down, and its pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, ejected and landed in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Captured by Pakistani forces, his detention in enemy territory triggered a wave of national concern and further heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Mr Bisaria writes India activated multiple diplomatic channels, with US and UK envoys pressing Islamabad. The Indian message was ""any attempt by Pakistan to escalate situation further or to cause harm to the pilot would lead to escalation by India.""
Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan announced the pilot's release on 28 February, with the handover occurring on 1 March under prisoner of war protocol. Pakistan presented the move as a ""goodwill gesture"" aimed at de-escalating tensions.
By 5 March, with the dust settling from Pulwama, Balakot, and the pilot's return, India's political temperature had cooled. The Cabinet Committee on Security decided to send India's high commissioner back to Pakistan, signalling a shift towards diplomacy.
""I arrived in Islamabad on 10 March, 22 days after leaving in the wake of Pulwama. The most serious military exchange since Kargil had run its course in less than a month,"" Mr Bisaria writes,
""India was willing to give old-fashioned diplomacy another chance.... This, with India having achieved a strategic and military objective and Pakistan having claimed a notion of victory for its domestic audience.""
The 2008 Mumbai attacks - a 60-hour siege on hotels, a railway station, and a Jewish centre - claimed 166 lives
Mr Bisaria described it as a ""testing and fascinating time"" to be a diplomat. This time, he notes, the key difference is that the targets were Indian civilians, and the attack occurred ""ironically, when the situation in Kashmir had dramatically improved"".
He views escalation as inevitable, but notes there's also a ""de-escalation instinct alongside the escalation instinct"". When the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meets during such conflicts, he says, their decisions weigh the conflict's economic impact and seek measures that hurt Pakistan without triggering a backlash against India.
""The body language and optics are similar [this time],"" he says, but highlights what he sees as the most significant move: India's threat to annul the Indus Waters Treaty. ""If India acts on this, it would have long-term, serious consequences for Pakistan.""
""Remember, we're still in the middle of a crisis,"" says Mr Bisaria. ""We haven't yet seen any kinetic [military] action."""
736,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgny7zden9o,2025-05-02 17:22:43,"Canada's Carney offers strategic invite to King ahead of Trump meeting,","In his first news conference since the federal election, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney laid out his priorities, including how he will approach upcoming talks with US President Donald Trump. 
His election campaign focused on standing up to Trump's tariff plans and threats to make Canada the 51st US state, which Carney has said will ""never ever"" happen.
The Liberals won 168 seats out of 343 in Canada's House of Commons in Monday's election, enough to form a minority government but falling short of the 172 necessary for a majority. 
Carney's new cabinet will be sworn in the week of 12 May. 
Here are three things we learned from Carney's comments: 
Off the top, Carney announced an upcoming visit from King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who will visit Canada later this month. 
""This is a historic honour that matches the weight of our times,"" he told reporters gathered in Ottawa. 
Carney says he had invited the King to formally open Canada's 45th Parliament on 27 May. 
That request is certainly strategic. 
Carney said the King's visit ""clearly underscores the sovereignty of our country"" - a nod to Trump's 51st state remarks. 
Trump also has a well-known admiration for the Royal family. In February, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer used his trip to the White House to present Trump with a letter from King Charles offering to host a second state visit.
The King is Canada's head of state and is represented in Canada by Governor General Mary Simon.
After an election, the new parliamentary session is usually opened by the governor general, who reads the Speech from the Throne on behalf of the prime minister. The speech, read in Canada's Senate, sets out the government's agenda.
While it is not unprecedented for the Throne speech to be read by the head of state, the last time this happened was in October 1977, external when Queen Elizabeth II read the speech for the second time. The first was in 1957. 
Carney will visit the White House on Tuesday, barely a week after the federal election. 
His first official visit to the White House as prime minister comes amid frayed ties between the close allies in the wake of Trump's threatened and imposed tariffs, as well as the president's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st US state. 
Carney said there are two sets of issues to discuss: the immediate tariffs and the broader relationship.
Trump disliked Trudeau - why Carney may fare better
Faisal Islam: Carney wants to lead a G7 fightback on Trump tariffs
""My government will fight to get the best deal for Canada,"" Carney said, making it clear there would be no rush to secure an agreement. 
He added that the high-level dialogue indicates seriousness of the conversation between the leaders. 
He said he expects ""difficult but constructive"" discussions with the president. 
He also said he would strengthen relationship with ""reliable"" trading partners, pointing to recent conversations he has had with world leaders in Europe and Asia. 
Canada's election highlighted divisions within Canada, along regional, demographic and political lines.
On Friday, Carney said Canada must be united in this ""once in a lifetime crisis"". 
""It's time to come together put on our Team Canada sweaters and win big,"" he said. 
He offered olive branches both to Canadians who did not vote for his Liberal Party and to his political rivals.
Why young voters flocked to Canada's Conservatives
While Canadians voted for a robust response to Trump, they also sent ""a clear message that their cost of living must come down and their communities need to be safe"", Carney said. 
""As prime minister I've heard these messages loud and clear and I will act on them with focus and determination."" 
He said he is committed to working with others, including those across the aisle. 
Under leader Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative campaign focused heavily on cost of living issues and crime. 
The Conservatives came in second, forming Official Opposition but Poilievre lost his own Ottawa-area seat. 
Carney said he is open to calling a special election that would allow Poilievre to seek another seat if that is the path the Conservatives wanted to take. 
""No games,"" he said. 
On Friday, an MP-elect in Alberta announced he would resign his safe Conservative seat to allow Poilievre to run. Poilievre later confirmed he will run in that constituency ""to hold the Liberal minority government to account""."
737,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9exj0nn0ko,2025-05-03 01:28:10,"How ordinary Poles are preparing for a Russian invasion,","Ordinary Poles have been signing up for military training days anticipating a military attack 
At a military training ground near the city of Wroclaw, ordinary Poles are lining up, waiting to be handed guns and taught how to shoot. ""Once the round is loaded, the weapon is ready to fire,"" barks the instructor, a Polish soldier, his face smeared with camouflage paint.
Young and old, men and women, parents and children, they've all come here for one reason: to learn how to survive an armed attack. 
As well as a turn on the shooting range, this Saturday morning programme, called ""Train with the Army"", also teaches civilians hand-to-hand combat, first aid and how to put on a gas mask.
""The times are dangerous now, we need to be ready,"" says the co-ordinator of the project, Captain Adam Sielicki. ""We have a military threat from Russia, and we are preparing for this.""
Capt Sielicki says the programme is oversubscribed, and the Polish government now has plans to expand it so that every adult male in the country receives training. Poland, which shares borders with both Russia and Ukraine, says it will spend almost 5% of GDP on defence this year, the highest in Nato.
The military training programme is oversubscribed and the Polish government plans to expand it to train every adult male in the country
Last week, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Poland aims to build ""the strongest army in the region"". Warsaw has been on a spending spree, buying planes, ships, artillery systems and missiles from the US, Sweden and South Korea, among others.
Dariusz is one of those attending the Saturday course in Wroclaw, and says he would be the ""very first"" to volunteer if Poland were attacked. ""History has taught us that we must be prepared to defend ourselves on our own. We cannot rely on anyone else. Today alliances exist, and tomorrow they are broken.""
As he removes his gas mask, Bartek says he thinks most Poles ""will take up arms"" if attacked, ""and be ready to defend the country.""
Agata is attending with a friend. She says the election of Donald Trump has made people more worried. ""He wants to pull out [of Europe]. That's why we feel even less safe. If we're not prepared and Russia attacks us, we'll simply become their prisoners.""
Agata says she feels more vulnerable after the US election
Statements by Donald Trump and members of his administration have caused deep concern among officials in Warsaw. During a visit to the Polish capital in February, the US defence secretary Pete Hegseth said Europe mustn't assume that the US troop presence on the continent ""will last forever"".
The US currently has 10,000 troops stationed in Poland, but Washington announced last month it was pulling out of a key military base in the city of Rzeszow in the east of Poland. Officials say the troops will be redeployed within Poland, but the move has caused yet more unease in the country. 
Donald Trump's apparent hostility towards Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and warm words for Russia's Vladimir Putin, have only added to the worry.
Poland is due to sign a defence agreement with France in the coming days, and another pact with the UK is in the pipeline â further moves by Warsaw to pivot away from its historically strong military ties with Washington. There is also talk of Poland being brought under the French military's ""nuclear umbrella"".
""I think [Trump] has certainly pressed us to think more creatively about our security,"" says Tomasz Szatkowski, the permanent representative of Poland to Nato and presidential advisor on defence. ""I think the US can't afford to lose Poland, because that would be a signâ¦ that you can't rely on the US. However, we do have to think of other options and develop our own capabilities.""
""If the Russians continue their aggressive intentions towards Europe, we're going to be the first one â the gatekeeper,"" Mr Szatkowski says. He ascribes Poland's rapid military build-up to ""first of all, the geopolitical situation, but also, the experience of history.""
Wanda Traczyk-Stawska was 12 years old the last time Russia invaded Poland
The painful legacy of Russian occupation can be felt everywhere here. 
At a state-run care home in Warsaw, 98-year-old Wanda Traczyk-Stawska recalls the last time Russian forces invaded â in 1939, when a pact between Stalin and Hitler resulted in Poland being carved up between the USSR and Nazi Germany.
""In 1939 I was twelve years old. I remember my father was very concerned about [the Russians],"" Wanda recalls, ""We knew that Russia had attacked us, they took advantage of the fact that the Germans had exposed us.""
On a shelf is a photograph of Wanda as a fighter, brandishing a machine gun during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, when the Polish underground fought the German Army amidst the ruins of the city. After pushing back the Germans in the dying days of World War Two, the Soviet Union installed a pro-Moscow regime in Poland, which ruled the country until 1989.
Currently, around 216,000 servicemen and women make up the Polish armed forces. The government says they intend to increase that to half a million, including reservists â which would give it the second-largest military in Nato after the United States.
Wanda (left), aged around fifteen, fighting in the Polish resistance in the 1944 Warsaw uprising
I ask Wanda whether she thinks it's a good thing that Poland is building up its military. ""Of course, yes. Russia has this aggression written into its history. I'm not talking about people, but the authorities are always like that,"" she sighs. ""It is better to be a well-armed country than to wait for something to happen. Because I am a soldier who remembers that weapons are the most important thing.""
Eighty years since the end of World War Two, Poles are once again eyeing their neighbours nervously. In a warehouse in southern Poland, by popular demand, one company has constructed a mock-up of a bomb shelter.
""These shelters are designed primarily to protect against a nuclear bomb, but also against armed attacks,"" says Janusz Janczy, the boss of ShelterPro, who shows me around the steel bunker, complete with bunk beds and a ventilation system. ""People are building these shelters simply because they don't know what to expect tomorrow.""
Janusz says he receives dozens of inquiries a week from Poles looking to buy bomb shelters
Janusz says demand for his shelters has soared since Donald Trump took office. ""It used to be just a few phone calls a month. Now there are dozens a week,"" he says, ""My clients are most afraid of Russia. And they're concerned that Nato wouldn't come to defend Poland.""
But are Poles ready to defend the country if those fears become a reality? A recent poll found that only 10.7% of adults said they would join the army as volunteers in the event of war, and a third said they would flee.
On a sunny afternoon in Wroclaw, I ask Polish students whether they'd be ready to defend their country if attacked. Most say they wouldn't. ""The war is very close but feels quite far,"" says medical student Marcel, ""but if Russia attacked, I think I'd run.""
""I would probably be the first one trying to escape the country,"" says another student, Szymon. ""I just don't really see anything worth dying for here.""

738,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckg58kyxxvxo,2025-05-02 06:26:29,"Israel says it struck near Syria palace over violence in Druze areas,","A Syrian TV channel said the Israeli strike hit an empty area near the presidential palace, which is on a hill in north-west Damascus
Israel says its fighter jets bombed an area next to the presidential palace in Syria's capital Damascus on Friday morning, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to protect the Druze religious minority following days of deadly sectarian violence.
Netanyahu said the strike was a ""clear message to the Syrian regime"" that Israel would ""not allow the deployment of forces south of Damascus or any threat to the Druze community"".
Later on Friday, the Israeli military confirmed it had launched another wave of air strikes, attacking military targets. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported nearly 20, with Syrian state media saying one person had been killed. 
The Syrian presidency has said it strongly condemns the strikes, calling them a ""dangerous escalation"" intended to destabilise Syria.
Israel also carried out strikes south of Damascus on Wednesday during clashes between Druze gunmen, security forces and allied Sunni Islamist fighters.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticised the recent Israeli bombing, calling it a ""violation of Syria's sovereignty"".
In a statement delivered by his spokesman, Guterres called for Israel to stop such attacks and to respect Syria's ""unity, its territorial integrity and its independence"".
A spiritual leader of Syria's Druze, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence on Thursday as an ""unjustifiable genocidal campaign"" against his community and called for intervention by ""international forces to maintain peace"".
Other Druze religious leaders put out a statement early on Friday confirming what they said was the community's ""commitment to a country that includes all Syrians, a nation that is free of strife"", according to the Associated Press.
They also reportedly said the state should be activated in Suweida province, and that authorities should be in control of the Suweida-Damascus highway.
The Syrian government said it had deployed security forces to Druze areas to combat ""outlaw groups"" which it accused of instigating the clashes.
According to SOHR, at least 109 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, a town in the southern outskirts of Damascus, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.
It says that includes 11 Druze civilians and 26 Druze fighters, as well as another 42 Druze men who were shot dead in an ""ambush"" by security forces while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday. Thirty members of the General Security service and allied fighters have also been killed, it says.
Istanbul-based Syria TV reported that the Israeli air strike near the presidential palace appeared to have targeted an empty area, and that there were no reports of casualties or material damage.
Israel's Defence Minister issued a statement saying that when the Syrian president woke up and saw the results he would ""understand well that Israel is determined to prevent harm to the Druze in Syria"".
""It is [Sharaa's] duty to protect the Druze in the suburbs of Damascus from jihadist assailants and to allow the hundreds of thousands of Druze in Suweida and Jabal al-Druze to defend themselves on their own, rather than sending jihadist forces into their communities,"" he added.
In a statement released on Friday afternoon, the Syrian presidency said it ""condemned in the strongest terms the bombing of the presidential palace yesterday by the Israeli occupation, which constitutes a dangerous escalation against state institutions and the sovereignty of the state"".
""This reprehensible attack reflects the continuation of reckless movements that seek to destabilize the country and exacerbate security crises,"" it added.
The presidency also called on the international community to stand by Syria in confronting the attacks, which it said violated international law.
A Druze religious leader in Suweida, Sheikh Hamoud al-Hinawi, meanwhile told the BBC that the situation was ""still tense"" in the affected areas.
""What is happening right now is sectarian targeting by extremist elements [and] it is the duty of the state to protect civilians,"" he said.
""We support the rule of law and national sovereignty of Syria, as long as the national government is protecting its citizens and adhering to its commitment to rebuilding a modern Syria.""
When asked whether he supported the Israeli intervention, Sheikh Hinawi said: ""It's not a matter of whether I am for or against Israel - it is a matter of life and death for us and if we are being attacked we have every right to defend ourselves.""
On Thursday, a member of the security forces deployed in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya told the BBC that they were ""not targeting any sect, but rather dealing with an armed group acting outside the law, regardless of its religious affiliation"", adding: ""Any such group will be held accountable.""
Syrian security forces said they were deployed to combat ""outlaw groups"" in Druze areas south of Damascus
The sectarian violence erupted in Jaramana on Monday night after an audio clip of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad circulated on social media and angered Sunni Muslims. It was attributed to a Druze cleric, but he denied any responsibility. The interior ministry also said a preliminary inquiry had cleared him.
The Druze faith is an offshoot of Shia Islam with its own unique identity and beliefs. Half its roughly one million followers live in Syria, where they make up about 3% of the population, while there are smaller communities in Lebanon, Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.
Syria's transitional President, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has promised to protect the country's many religious and ethnic minorities since his Sunni Islamist group led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad's regime in December after 13 years of devastating civil war.
However, the mass killings of hundreds of civilians from Assad's minority Alawite sect in the western coastal region in March, during clashes between the new security forces and Assad loyalists, hardened fears among minority communities.
In February, Israel's prime minister warned that he would not ""tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria"" from the country's new security forces.
Netanyahu also demanded the complete demilitarisation of Suweida and two other southern provinces, saying Israel saw Sharaa's Sunni Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), as a threat. HTS is a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK.
The Israeli military has already carried out hundreds of strikes across Syria to destroy the country's military assets over the past four months. It has also sent troops into the UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syria, as well as several adjoining areas and the summit of Mount Hermon."

Germany's Foreign Office has defended a decision to classify the Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, after sharp criticism from the White House.
US Vice-President JD Vance accused ""bureaucrats"" of rebuilding the Berlin Wall, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio slammed the designation as ""tyranny in disguise"".
In an unusual move, the foreign office directly replied to Rubio on X, writing: ""We have learnt from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped.""
The intelligence agency that made the classification found AfD's ""prevailing understanding of people based on ethnicity and descent"" goes against Germany's ""free democratic order"".
The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.
The agency, Bundesamt fÃ¼r Verfassungsschutz (BfV), had already classed the AfD as right-wing extremist in three eastern states where its popularity is highest. Now, that designation has been extended to the entire party.
The AfD ""aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society"", it said in a statement, external. The agency said specifically that the party did not consider citizens ""from predominantly Muslim countries"" as equal members of the German people.
Joint party leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was ""clearly politically motivated"" and a ""severe blow to German democracy"".
Beatrix von Storch, the party's deputy parliamentary leader, told the BBC's Newshour programme that the designation was ""the way an authoritarian state, a dictatorship, would treat their parties"".
AfD classified as extreme-right by German intelligence
The new classification gives authorities greater powers to monitor the AfD using tactics like phone interception and undercover agents.
""That's not democracy - it's tyranny in disguise,"" wrote Marco Rubio on X.
But the German Foreign Office hit back.
""This is democracy,"" it wrote, directly replying to the politician's X account.
The post said the decision had been made after a ""thorough and independent investigation"" and could be appealed.
""We have learnt from our history that right-wing extremism needs to be stopped,"" the statement concluded - a reference to Hitler's Nazi party and the Holocaust.
JD Vance, who met Weidel in Munich nine days before the election and used a speech to the Munich Security Conference to show support for the AfD, said that ""bureaucrats"" were trying to destroy the party.
""The West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt - not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment,"" he wrote on X.
The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, separated East and West Berlin for nearly 30 years during the Cold War.
The new designation has reignited calls to ban the AfD ahead of a vote next week in the parliament, or Bundestag, to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor. He will be leading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).
Lars Klingbeil, the SPD leader who is expected to become vice-chancellor and finance minister, said that while no hasty decision would be made, the government would consider banning the AfD.
""They want a different country, they want to destroy our democracy. And we must take that very seriously,"" he told Bild newspaper."
740,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkx3gdvv75o,2025-05-03 00:21:24,"How Canada's Conservatives threw away a 27-point lead to lose again,","One of the biggest upsets of the night was Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre losing his own seat 
Conservatives in Canada are trading blame for Monday night's election loss, showing that Pierre Poilievre will need to heal divisions within the movement as he fights to stay on as leader.
As a clear Liberal win was emerging on election night, Conservative candidates and their supporters had one question: What the heck just happened?
The party had lost a remarkable 27-point lead in opinion polls and failed to win an election for the fourth time in a row. 
And while it gained seats and earned almost 42% of the popular vote - its highest share since the party was founded in 2003 - its leader Poilievre was voted out of the seat he had held for the past 20 years.
""Nobody's happy about that,"" Shakir Chambers, a Conservative strategist and vice-president of Ontario-based consultancy firm the Oyster Group, told the BBC.
The party is now trying to work out how it will move forward.
At the top of the agenda will be finding a way for the Conservatives to perform their duties as the Official Opposition - the second-place party in Canada's parliament whose job is to hold the sitting government to account - without their leader in the House.
Ahead of a caucus meeting next Tuesday to discuss this, Poilievre announced on Friday his plan to run in an Alberta constituency special election to win back a seat.
That special election will be triggered by the resignation of Conservative MP-elect Damien Kurek, who said he will voluntarily step down to let Poilievre back in after what he called ""a remarkable national campaign"".
""An unstoppable movement has grown under his leadership, and I know we need Pierre fighting in the House of Commons,"" Kurek said in a statement.
Unlike the US, federal politicians in Canada do not have to live in the city or province they run in. Poilievre grew up in Alberta, however, and will likely win handily as the constituency he is running in is a Conservative stronghold.
A big question is whether Poilievre still has the backing of his own party to stay on as leader.  Mr Chambers said the answer, so far, is a resounding yes.
""Pierre has a lot of support in the caucus,"" he said. ""I don't think there's anybody that wants him removed, or that has super high ambitions that wants to replace him as leader.""
A number of high-profile Conservatives have already rallied behind him. One of them is Andrew Scheer, a current MP and former leader of the party, who said Poilievre should stay on to ""ensure we finish the job next time"".
Others are casting blame on where they went wrong.
Jamil Jivani, who won his own constituency in a suburb of Toronto handily, felt that Ontario leader Doug Ford had betrayed the conservative movement and cost the party the election.
The federal and provincial Conservative parties are legally different entities, though they belong to the same ideological tent, and Ford is leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party.
He frequently made headlines during the election campaign for his get-tough attitude with Donald Trump and the US president's trade war. 
""He couldn't stay out of our business,"" Jivani told a CBC reporter.
Jivani, who in a past life attended Yale University with US Vice-President JD Vance, where the two became good friends, accused Ford of distracting from the federal Conservatives' campaign and of ""positioning himself as some political genius that we need to be taking cues from"".
But Mr Chambers, the Conservative strategist, said that Poilievre will also need to confront where the party fell short.
Federal Conservatives have blamed Ontario leader Doug Ford, another conservative, for their loss 
Poilievre, who is known for his combative political style, has struggled with being unlikeable, external among the general Canadian public.
He has also failed to shore up the support of popular Conservative leaders in some provinces, like Ontario's Ford, who did not campaign for Poilievre despite his recent landslide victory in a provincial election earlier this year. Ford did, however, post a photo of him and Liberal leader Mark Carney having a coffee.
""Last time I checked, Pierre Poilievre never came out in our election,"" Ford told reporters earlier this week. ""Matter of fact, he or one of his lieutenants told every one of his members, 'don't you dare go out and help'"".
""Isn't that ironic?""
Another Conservative premier, Tim Houston of Nova Scotia - who also did not campaign for Poilievre - said the federal party needs to do some ""soul-searching"" after its loss.
""I think the Conservative Party of Canada was very good at pushing people away, not so good at pulling people in,"" Houston said.
Not every premier stood on the sidelines. Poilievre was endorsed by Alberta's Danielle Smith and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, both western Conservatives.
Kory Teneycke, Ford's campaign manager, who publicly criticised Poilievre's campaign during the election, angering federal Conservatives, rejected the notion that Ford's failure to endorse Poilievre had cost him the election.
He told the BBC that, to him, the bigger problem was Poilievre's failure to unite Conservative voters in Canada.
""What constitutes a Conservative in different parts of the country can look quite different,"" he said, adding that Poilievre's populist rhetoric and aggressive style appealed to Conservatives in the west, but alienated those in the east.
""There was a lot of Trump mimicry in terms of how they presented the campaign,"" Mr Teneycke said. 
""Donald Trump is public enemy number one to most in Canada, and I don't think it was coming across very well.""
He added he believes some of the ""soul-searching"" by Poilievre's Conservatives will need to include a plan of how to build a coalition of the right in a country ""as big and diverse as Canada"".
Asked by reporters what it would take to heal the rift, Ford answered: ""All they have to do is make a phone call."""

The former chief executive of fashion brand Abercrombie & Fitch is ""mentally incompetent"" and currently unfit to stand trial on charges of sex trafficking and prostitution, a US court has ruled.
Mike Jeffries will now be held in custody and treated in hospital for an initial period of up to four months to determine if his condition is likely to improve enough for the case to proceed.  
Mr Jeffries' legal team said last December he has dementia and late onset Alzheimer's disease.
He is accused of using his wealth, power and status to traffic and sexually abuse vulnerable men over years - alleged crimes that could carry a life-term jail sentence.  
Mike Jeffries, his life partner Matthew Smith and their middleman Jim Jacobson have all pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges
Judge Nusrat Choudhury agreed on Friday that the defendant was ""suffering from a mental disease or defect"", making him ""unable to understand"" court proceedings.
The ruling followed an assessment by two medical experts - one designated by Mr Jeffries' defence team, the other chosen by prosecutors.
Judge Choudhury said in a court order that Mr Jeffries would be treated in hospital for up to four months to see if he is likely to regain competency. 
Once a follow-up assessment is complete, the defendant could either face trial or the court will weigh up next steps.
These could include dropping the criminal charges against him, or releasing him to home confinement.
Mr Jeffries was arrested and charged last October along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, 61, and their middleman, James Jacobson, 72.  All three deny the allegations.
US prosecutors allege the men used force, fraud and coercion to make young men, many of whom were aspiring models, engage in violent and exploitative sex acts while Mr Jeffries was chief executive from at least 2008 until 2015.
The charges followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series that revealed the three of them benefited from a sophisticated operation in which recruiters scouted young men for sex in cities including London, New York, Paris and Marrakesh.
The BBC has since revealed that more than 40 men, including Abercrombie & Fitch employees, have now come forward with civil allegations of sexual assault, drugging or rape - with claims dating back to 1992, the year Mr Jeffries started running the company.
Civil trial lawyers have told the BBC their clients are dismayed at the criminal court's decision that Mr Jeffries is unfit to stand trial.
""We've been speaking with our clients who are disappointed by the decision and still want justice,"" said Brad Edwards and Brittany Henderson, representing 26 alleged victims.
Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had recently been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which ""will almost certainly worsen over time"".
Dr Cheryl Paradis, the US prosecutor's medical expert, also independently assessed Mr Jeffries. According to court papers, she found he was unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to properly assist in his defence.
""His memory impairment almost certainly would cause him to be unable to accurately recall key events and details,"" Dr Paradis said, according to the court filings, ""and severely limit his capacity to provide accurate and reliable information"".
She added: ""Additionally, his inappropriate behaviour, which is a symptom of his dementia, could further interfere with his ability to maintain proper courtroom demeanour. He may blurt out self-incriminating statements or engage in erratic behaviour, which would undermine his credibility.""
The BBC understands that Mr Jacobson and Mr Smith could still face trial on the same sex-trafficking and prostitution charges.
Alongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries and his partner Mr Smith have been defending multiple civil lawsuits accusing them of rape, sex trafficking and assault, which they ""vehemently deny"".
The civil lawsuits had been stayed - or legally put on pause - until the resolution of the criminal case, which takes precedence to protect Mr Jeffries' right against self-incrimination.
Lawsuit accuses Abercrombie & Fitch of funding sex-trafficking operation
While his criminal case remains uncertain, Mr Jeffries could still face a civil trial or reach a settlement over the allegations. If this was the case, the outcome could lead to compensation being awarded to alleged victims.
""Mike Jeffries attacked these men and ruined their lives at a point when they were at their most vulnerable and chasing their dreams,"" said civil case lawyer, Brad Edwards.
""He will still be held accountable by our lawsuit and his co-conspirators will still face the criminal justice system.
""For anyone affected still in fear about coming forward, you should be reassured that his power is now totally gone"".
Abercrombie & Fitch is also being sued for negligence, with lawsuits claiming that it knowingly facilitated ""heinous sexual crimes"".
The company - which also owns the Hollister brand - has previously said it was ""appalled and disgusted"" by Mr Jeffries' alleged behaviour."

A ""day-long festival"" will be held on the National Mall in Washington DC, an army spokesperson said, adding that the event would feature 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles and 50 aircraft. 
Trump first floated a military parade during his first term, but he scrapped the idea after reports it would have cost about $90 million (Â£71m).
Earlier on Friday, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day - known as Remembrance Day in the UK - as ""Victory Day for World War I"" to celebrate American contributions to the conflict.
The army said planning for the military parade was ""actively underway"", and it was exploring ""options to make the celebration even bigger, with more capability demonstrations, additional displays of equipment, and more engagement with the community."" Trump turns 79 that day.
He first proposed a military parade for Veterans Day in 2018.
He said he wanted the US to ""top"" France's Bastille Day parade, which he attended on a visit to Paris in 2017.
Local politicians asked for a ""ridiculously high"" price, he said, and the idea was abandoned.
Meanwhile, in addition to renaming Veterans Day, Trump has said he wants to name VE Day on 8 May as ""Victory Day for World War II"".
The announcement was not accompanied by an executive order, and it is unclear whether he intends for 8 May to become a federal holiday - a power that rests with the US Congress. 
The days mark the end of World War I in 1918 and Germany's surrender to the allies in 1945, respectively.
In his late-night post, Trump said that ""many of our allies and friends are celebrating May 8th as Victory Day, but we did more than any other country, by far, in producing a victorious result"" in the Second World War. 
""We won both wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,"" he added. ""That's because we don't have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! So we are going to start celebrating our victories again!"" 
Later on Friday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to deny reports the name of Veterans Day would be changing, writing on X: ""We will always honor Veterans Day AND we should commemorate the end of WWI and WWII as VICTORY DAYS!""
Donald Trump attended a Bastille Day ceremony in 2018
VE Day celebrations being held in the UK, France, Canada and other parts of the world this year mark 80 years since World War Two formally ended in Europe with Germany's unconditional surrender shortly after Berlin fell to Soviet forces. 
Russia commemorates the occasion as the end of what it calls the ""Great Patriotic War"". It is one of the most important holidays in the country and is marked by a massive parade.
About 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, which started in 1939 when Germany, alongside the Soviets, invaded Poland.
According to statistics published online by the US National WWII Museum in New Orleans, about 418,500 Americans were killed in both the European and Pacific theatres of the conflict. Of the total, about 416,000 were military casualties.  
The US has not historically recognised VE Day. The country was still at war with Japan on the Pacific front for several more months after conflict ended in Europe.
Veterans Day, known as Remembrance Day in the UK, was formerly known as Armistice Day in the US to mark the end of fighting in Europe on 11 November 1918.
After World War Two and the Korean War, it was renamed to honour all US military veterans. Memorial Day, which always falls on the last Monday in May, honours Americans who were killed in battle."

Shares saw gains for the ninth day in a row for the first time since 2004 after a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hope of US-China trade talks.
Major US indexes were all up when the market closed on Friday - the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had both risen 1.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.4%.
The tech sector made the biggest gains, with Microsoft and Nvidia growing by more than 2%.
It came as the Department of Labor said on Friday that US employers had added 177,000 new jobs in April.
The report outpaced analysts' predictions, although it was still a slowdown in hiring from the month beforehand. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%.
Another sign of encouragement for investors was Beijing's announcement on Friday that it was considering an offer from Washington to hold trade talks with the US.
At 145%, China faces the highest import taxes by far.
For some analysts the jobs figures tamped down recession fears in the wake of commerce department data this week showing a contraction in the US economy for the first time in three years.
""There is nothing to complain about here,"" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note.
""You cannot find any evidence of a nascent recession in these figures.""
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, also saw cause for optimism.
""The economy will weaken in the coming months but, with this underlying momentum, the US has a decent chance of averting recession if it can step back from the tariff brink in time,"" she said.
But other experts said it would take time to see the full effect of Trump's tariffs.
While the jobs report is strong, ""the outlook remains very uncertain,"" Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, told the BBC on Friday."

One of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has broken down in tears and left the courtroom as she testified in the former Hollywood mogul's sex crimes retrial.
Miriam Haley was being cross-examined by Weinstein's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, about her allegation that the disgraced producer sexually assaulted her in 2006. 
In his third trial in five years, Mr Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing Ms Haley and two other women.
The 73-year-old has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer has sought to cast doubt on his accusers' claims and credibility.
Ms Haley, 48, alleges that Mr Weinstein sexually assaulted her in July 2006 after inviting her to his apartment to ""just stop by and say hi"". 
She alleges he backed her into a bedroom and held her down on the bed as she pleaded ""no, no - it's not going to happen"". 
During Friday's exchange, Mr Weinstein's lawyer Ms Bonjean questioned what Ms Haley was wearing during the incident, and whether she took her own clothes off or whether Weinstein removed them. 
""He took my clothes offâ¦I didn't take my clothes off,"" Ms Haley testified. ""He was the one who raped me, not the other way around.""
""That is for the jury to decide,"" Mr Weinstein's lawyer replied.
""No, it's not for the jury to decide. It's my experience. And he did that to me,"" Ms Haley argued, using expletives as tears streamed down her face.
Judge Curtis Farber then paused proceedings to give Ms Haley a chance to compose herself. 
Cross-examination continued after the break.
Ms Haley, who worked as a production assistant on the Weinstein-produced television show Project Runway, is the first accuser to testify at his retrial. 
Mr Weinstein is charged with sexually assaulting Ms Haley and Kaja Sokola and raping a third woman, Jessica Mann.
He denies the allegations and his lawyers argue that his accusers had consensual encounters with a then-powerful movie producer who could advance their careers.
An appeals court overturned Mr Weinstein's conviction in 2020 after finding he did not get a fair trial."
745,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c626e935llwo,2025-03-27 21:44:44,"How will Australia choose its next prime minister?,","Australia's 2025 election began with a false start.
Everyone was poised and ready to go when a cyclone blew the government's preferred date â for April 12 â off course. 
Instead, Albanese settled for a May 3 polling date with the firing gun finally fired in late March.
There have been announcements about health, vows to cut fuel tax and proposals from each side to fix the country's housing crisis â but as the campaign dragged on, both leaders struggled to compete for Australia's attention.
They had to contend with Donald Trump and his sweeping tariffs scheme for headlines, weave their campaigns around Easter, suspend them briefly to mark the Pope's death, only to revive them ahead of a long weekend most Australians would not have spent thinking about politics.
""It has been hard to cut through... but the major parties have lost the trust of the voters which has amplified their problems of communications,"" says John Warhurst, an Emeritus Professor at the Australian National University's School of Politics.
""The government has been timid and the opposition has been shambolic.""
So now, after five weeks of campaigning, Australia's 18 million citizens are facing a choice between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his rival Peter Dutton, both of whom may need to form the next government by securing the support of independent MPs or minor parties.
Here's everything you need to know about Australia's 2025 vote.
Australia has two major parties: the left-leaning Australian Labor Party and the conservative Liberal-National coalition. 
The Labor Party's Anthony Albanese who has been the prime minister since 2022, is running for re-election.
A stalwart of parliament for almost 30 years, he enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power. However, in recent times he has come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs, antisemitism and Islamophobia.
Albanese is being challenged by Peter Dutton, who became head of the Liberal-National coalition after their 2022 defeat. He is contesting his first election as opposition leader. 
Known as a staunch conservative, Dutton has years of experience in important ministerial portfolios - like defence and home affairs - but has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.
Australians do not get to vote for the PM candidates themselves as there is no separate leadership ballot.  The leader of the party that receives the most seats in the House of Representatives becomes prime minister. 
The cost of living is the biggest concern for many voters. 
Since the 2022 election, inflation - which is now slowing - has pushed up the prices of everyday essentials such as food and utilities, leaving many households feeling stretched. 
The Albanese government has implemented a string of policies that it says are aimed at providing relief, such as keeping the cost of medications down, and offering tax cuts, energy rebates and rental assistance to those eligible.  
However, Australia has raised interest rates 12 times since Albanese was elected in May 2022 - something that is done independently of government but seen to reflect their economic management. That has put additional pressure on borrowers and those with mortgages.
Housing affordability will also be a key issue, with several Australian cities among the most expensive in the world for homebuyers. 
Australia's universal healthcare system, now struggling because of staff shortages and soaring costs, is another major concern for voters. Politicians across the spectrum admit there's a crisis, with many Australians delaying or skipping care - and both parties have promised billions in additional funding to fix it.
There are also global issues voters will consider, including the US President Donald Trump's tariffs, and his trade war with China.
Like many other nations, Australia has a close strategic alliance with the US while also maintaining a strong trading relationship with China. The country's new government will find itself dealing with a very different - and much more unpredictable - world order.
It is compulsory for Australians to vote on election day - and many will queue for a customary sausage in bread
Australia famously has a unique electoral system - and some quirky polling day traditions. 
Voting is mandatory for all citizens over 18 and picking up a ""democracy sausage"" - a barbecued sausage typically served on bread and sold at polling booths - is an election day custom.
Australia uses a preferential voting system, where candidates are ranked in order of preference.
If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote in the first tally, the votes from the least popular candidates are redistributed, and that process is repeated until someone secures a majority.
In races for the House of Representatives, voters are required to mark a preference down for every single candidate listed on the ballot in their area. 
However, in Senate races, voters only need to mark down a designated number of preferences. 
In this election, all 150 seats in the House of Representatives will be up for grabs, as well as 40 of the 76 seats in the Senate. 
One party needs to win at least 76 seats in the House to form a majority government.
If it cannot do that, it must try to win support from minor parties or independent MPs. 
Labor formed a majority government after winning the 2022 election, which delivered the biggest loss for the Liberal Party since its inception. 
As it stands, Labor has 78 seats in the House of Representatives, while the coalition has 57, with minor parties and independents splitting the remainder.
But with one House seat abolished, Labor will be stripped of its majority in parliament if it loses just two seats.
In order to form a government in its own right, the coalition will need to win 19 seats, likely including many of those it lost to independent candidates during the 2022 vote. 
In both state and federal elections, the vote share for minor parties and independents has been steadily increasing in Australia for decades. 
That reached record levels in the 2022 federal election, with one in three Australians casting votes for candidates outside the two major parties, external.
Once polls close, counting begins right away and results are updated in real time on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website - in what is known as an unofficial preliminary counting.
Historically, Australians will know who forms government on election night based off this â and the result will usually be called by media commentators, election experts or even the candidates themselves.
Official results can take days or even weeks to come, as the AEC has to go through a rigorous counting process, counting approximately 18 million ballot papers by hand, including postal and overseas ballot papers."
746,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy6zk9wkrdo,2025-05-02 09:05:38,"AfD classified as extreme-right by German intelligence,","Alice Weidel, joint AfD leader, said the decision was a ""severe blow against German democracy""
Germany's Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has been designated as right-wing extremist by the country's federal office for the protection of the constitution.
""The ethnicity- and ancestry-based understanding of the people prevailing within the party is incompatible with the free democratic order,"" the domestic intelligence agency said in a statement.
The German foreign ministry defended the decision after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the move ""tyranny in disguise"" and Vice-President JD Vance said the Berlin Wall was being rebuilt.
The AfD came second in federal elections in February, winning a record 152 seats in the 630-seat parliament with 20.8% of the vote.
The parliament, or Bundestag, will hold a vote next week to confirm conservative leader Friedrich Merz as chancellor, heading a coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats. 
AfD joint leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said the decision was ""clearly politically motivated"" and a ""severe blow to German democracy"". They argued their party was being ""discredited and criminalised"" shortly before the change of government.
The far-right AfD had already been placed under observation for suspected extremism in Germany, and the intelligence agency had also classed it as right-wing extremist in three states in the east, where its popularity is highest.
The agency, or Verfassungsschutz, said specifically that the AfD did not consider citizens of a ""migration background from predominantly Muslim countries"" as equal members of the German people.
AfD deputy chairman Stephan Brandner said the decision was ""complete nonsense, has absolutely nothing to do with law and order"". 
However, acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the agency had made a clear and unambiguous decision with ""no political influence whatsoever"", after a comprehensive review and a report of 1,100 pages. 
Bundestag Vice-President Andrea Lindholz said that as a designated right-wing extremist group the AfD should not be treated as other parties, especially in parliament.
Because of their large number of seats, AfD members could be eligible to chair parliamentary committees, but Lindholz said that idea was now ""almost unthinkable"".
After their election success, AfD leaders said the so-called firewall that had prevented other parties from working with them should end.
""Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them,"" said Tino Chrupalla. 
Having doubled its share of the vote in under four years, Chrupalla's party is still second in the opinion polls behind Merz's conservatives, despite several scandals, including one high-profile member being convicted of using banned Nazi slogans.
Earlier this year Alice Weidel embraced the term ""remigration"", widely seen as meaning the mass deportation of people with a migrant background, although she rejected that definition.
The AfD also attracted the support of leading figures in the Trump administration. Nine days before the election, US Vice-President JD Vance met Weidel in Munich and said there was no place for ""firewalls"", alleging that free speech was in retreat in Europe.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk gave Weidel a long audience in a livestreamed chat on X and called on Germans to vote for the AfD. He then repeatedly posted his support for Weidel's party in the run-up to the election.
On Friday JD Vance posted on X that ""the AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it.""
He also accused the ""German establishment"" of rebuilding the Berlin Wall - a reference to the barrier built in 1961 to separate East and West Berlin during the Cold War.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision taken by the German intelligence agency meant it had been given ""new powers to surveil the opposition. That's not democracy - it's tyranny in disguise"".
This prompted a rare retort from the German Foreign Office.
""This is democracy,"" it posted on X. ""We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.""
As part of its role in ensuring Germany's ""free democratic basic order"", the domestic intelligence agency is responsible for both counter-intelligence and investigating terror threats. 
Although its change in designation of the AfD is expected to be challenged in the courts, it would likely lower the threshold for the agency using informants and surveillance in monitoring the party.
Some German politicians have said the party's new designation should lead to a ban.
Under Germany's Basic Law - a constitution adopted in 1949 four years after the fall of Hitler's Nazi regime , external- parties that ""deliberately undermine the functioning of Germany's free democratic basic order"" can be banned if they act in a ""militant and aggressive way"".
Domestic intelligence cannot push for a ban on the party - that can only go through the two houses of parliament, government or the constitutional court - but its latest decision could encourage others to start the process.
Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned against rushing into a decision, but Heidi Reichinnek of the Left Party said no-one could accept that ""a proven right-wing extremist party is fighting and destroying our democracy from within"".
Since the war, the constitutional court has banned only two parties, both in the 1950s.
The Christian Democrat state premier of Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany called on the incoming government to initiate proceedings to ban the AfD. Daniel GÃ¼nther told Spiegel magazine that the party presented a risk to ""social harmony"".
But Michael Kretschmer, the Christian Democrat premier in the eastern state of Saxony, was quoted as saying that the ""enemies of democracy are not fought solely by the state - defence of democracy begins in the heart of society"".
In a further post on X, Musk argued on Friday that banning ""the centrist AfD"", which he also labelled Germany's most popular party, ""would be an extreme attack on democracy"".
The deputy leader of the Social Democrat SPD, Serpil Midyatli, said it was now in black and white what everybody already knew. ""It's clear for me that the ban has to come,"" she said, according to German press agency dpa.
Regardless of the AfD's election success, she said the founding fathers of Germany's post-war constitution had sought to ensure the country would not be plunged back into the abyss."

Although one of his most pressing tasks is to deal with his US counterpart President Donald Trump - who has targeted Canada with trade tariffs and even vowed to make the country the 51st state of America - Carney has also promised action on a range of domestic issues.
In his victory speech in the early hours of Tuesday, Carney pledged to ""build, baby, build"" - an apparent nod to Trump's pledges on oil drilling.
""It's time to build twice as many homes every year with an entirely new housing industry using Canadian technology, Canadian skilled workers, Canadian lumber,"" Carney told supporters.
Housing prices have skyrocketed across the country in the last decade. By doubling the rate of building, Carney hopes to have a supply of 500,000 new homes a year.
The Liberals want to create a standalone federal entity that would act as a developer for affordable housing. They plan to use this body to supply tens of billions of Canadian dollars in debt-financing for prefabricated home builders.
In his first news conference on Friday, Carney said his government ""will address failures in the housing market head on"", including by developing a modular and prefabricated housing industry. 
Like people in other countries, Canadians have been grappling with higher prices for everyday goods while wages have failed to keep up - an issue over which Carney's party was criticised while under the stewardship of his predecessor Justin Trudeau. 
The Liberals have proposed a slight tax cut for those in the lowest  bracket, who are due to see their rate reduce from 15% to 14%.
Carney's party has also vowed to scrap sales taxes on homes under C$1m ($720,000; Â£540,000) for first-time buyers.
It also wants to make dental care available to lower-income Canadians by extending a national insurance programme to 4.5 million people aged 18 to 64. The plan currently covers children, the elderly and some disabled Canadians.
The Liberals will also cap the number of temporary workers and international students allowed into the country to less than 5% of the population to the end of 2027 to ease pressure on housing and government services. 
The Liberals have vowed to maintain the push on reducing emissions - as part of the fight against climate change - while ensuring Canadian companies are still competitive.
Carney has promised to build a national ""east to west"" electricity grid to reduce energy dependence on the US.
One of his first moves as PM, before the election, was to repeal Trudeau's unpopular carbon pricing programme, which was designed to give financial incentives for people and firms to turn away from fossil fuels.
But Carney maintained a similar tax on large carbon emitters.
In his victory speech, he said: ""It's time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy.""
Carney has vowed to raise defence spending to 2% of Canada's GDP, which is the target for all countries in the Nato military alliance. Last year, it spent less than 1.4%.
Trump has been critical of countries not meeting the 2% benchmark, and says Canada relies too much militarily on the US.
And Trump's pursuit of Canada as a ""51st state"" of the US has focused minds north of the border on their own security independence.
The Liberals say they will spend C$18bn on defence over the next four years, which will go to purchasing new equipment like submarines and heavy icebreakers that can be used in Canada's north.
Carney has pledged to find new ways to trade in light of the impediments placed on cross-border commerce by Trump's tariffs regime. 
In his speech on Tuesday, Carney vowed new ""trade and energy corridors working in partnership with the provinces, territories, and Indigenous peoples"".
On Friday, Carney pledged to remove federal barriers to trade between provinces by 1 July.
Among his plans are an ""all-in-Canada"" network for vehicle parts, under which more manufacturing will happen domestically - meaning less reliance on imports from the US.
The Liberals also want to invest C$5bn in national ports, railways, roads and other infrastructure that would help the country further diversify its trading partners.

Coastal areas of Chile and Argentina were evacuated after Chilean authorities issued a tsunami warning following a 7.4 magnitude earthquake off the country's southern coast.
Thousands of people made their way to higher ground after the earthquake struck in the Drake Passage between Cape Horn, on the southern tip of South America, and Antarctica on Friday at 09:58 local time (12:58 GMT).
The US Geological Survey said its epicentre was 219km (136 miles) from Ushuaia, Argentina - the world's most southerly city.
The tsunami warning was issued for Chile's remote Magallanes region and the Chilean Antarctic Territory, with precautionary measures also taken in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego region.
The earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km (6 miles), the US Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
Residents in affected areas were advised to act calmly and follow the instructions of the authorities. 
In a post on X, Chilean President Gabriel Boric said: ""We call for evacuation of the coastline throughout the Magallanes region.""
More than 1,700 people moved to higher ground in the sparsely-populated area, including 1,000 from the town of Puerto Williams and 500 from Puerto Natales, , according to Chile's disaster agency (Senapred).
Some 32 people also followed evacuation procedures in Chile's Antarctic research bases, Senapred added. The agency has issued its highest level of alert for disasters, meaning all resources can be mobilised to respond.
Footage posted on social media showed people calmly heading for higher ground in the remote town of Puerto Williams, with sirens blaring in the background.
Chile's police force also posted a video showing an officer pushing a person in a wheelchair up a hill in the town, home to around 2,800 people.
In Argentina, the earthquake was felt primarily in Ushuaia, with other towns affected ""to a lesser extent"", the office for the governor of the region said.
An official from the region's civil protection agency told local media that around 2,000 people had been evacuated away from the Argentine coastline. 
Chile is often affected by earthquakes, with three tectonic plates converging within its territory."

An Illinois landlord who fatally stabbed a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy and severely wounded his mother has been sentenced to 53 years in prison.
Joseph Czuba, 73, was convicted in February for murder and hate crimes for the death of Wadee Alfayoumi, and the wounding of his mother Hanan Shaheen in 2023 shortly after the start of the Israel-Gaza war.
The family had been tenants in Czuba's home in Plainfield, roughly 64 km (40 miles) from Chicago. Prosecutors said he targeted them over their Muslim faith. 
Czuba had pleaded not guilty, but jurors convicted him after deliberating for less than 90 minutes.
Wadee Alfayoumi's great uncle, Mahmoud Yousef, told the court on Friday that no sentence was going to ""justify"" the boy's death, according to NBC News.  
""The day he was killed, his father had memories, had plans for his son,"" he continued, saying Czuba ""had no right to take them"".
Appearing in a red jail uniform, the thin and frail looking convict declined to speak on his own behalf.
The trial included testimony from Alfayoumi's mother, who described the encounter in harrowing detail, and from Czuba's now ex-wife, who said he had grown agitated by the war.
Last words of knifed US Muslim boy were 'Mom, I'm fine'

Hanan Shaheen testified during the trial that Czuba had told her ""you, as a Muslim, must die"", according to Reuters.
On the day of the attack, he forced his way into the home of the Alfayoumi family, who had been renting rooms from him and attacked them with a knife, prosecutors said.
He stabbed the mother over a dozen times, prosecutors said, then turned towards the boy and stabbed him 26 times.
Joseph Czuba was found guilty of a hate crime for the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old Muslim boy 
Evidence during trial included graphic crime scene photos and police saying they found Czuba outside the house after the attack with his body and hands covered in blood.
The deadly attack received national attention and renewed concerns of Islamophobia, anti-Muslim discrimination, and anti-Palestinian prejudice.
The young boy had celebrated his sixth birthday just a few weeks before he was killed.

The government said that at the time he registered on the electoral roll he was not legally a citizen of Ivory Coast.
Tidjane Thiam has been disqualified from running in the Ivory Coast's presidential election in October
In the BBC interview, Thiam suggested that the ruling had been politically motivated.
""It's not for the regime to choose who runs opposition parties. It's not for the regime to eliminate opposition leaders,"" he said.
""I don't think anybody in the Ivory Coast believes that this is not a weaponisation of the legal system by the government.""
This was rejected by Ivory Coast's Information Minister Amadou Coulibaly.
""The court rules that at the time he was registered on that [electoral] list, he was not Ivorian,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme on Friday.
""This is clear proof that this gentleman does not know Ivory Coast... We have a problem with morality with Mr Thiam - he knew he was wrong,"" he added.
Thiam told the BBC: ""What's happened is that they dug out a 1961 law that has never been applied to anybody. But in theory, it says that if you take another nationality, you lose your Ivorian citizenship.""
""Most of the Ivorian football team is in the same case,"" he said, in reference to the national football team which triumphed at the most recent Africa Cup of Nations tournament.
""So if we apply the law the way [that] they just applied it to me, we have to give the cup back to Nigeria - because half of the team was not Ivorian.""
Although Thiam relinquished his French nationality in March to run in the election, the court found that his candidacy was invalid, given that he was not Ivorian when he first registered on the electoral roll.
The 1961 nationality code states that: ""An Ivorian national of full age who voluntarily acquires or states that he possesses a foreign nationality shall lose Ivorian nationality.""
Thiam is now mounting a legal challenge.
His disqualification came just a week after the centre-right Ivory Coast Democratic Party (PDCI) confirmed him as its presidential candidate.
Outraged members of the party say they are suspending all parliamentary activity in protest at his disqualification.
His supporters are still hopeful he could be readmitted as a candidate.
The final electoral list for October's election is to be published on 20 June.
Thiam was expected to challenge the ruling RHDP party currently led by Alassane Ouattara, who has been in power for 15 years.
Ouattara was previously barred from running for president in the early 2000s on the grounds of nationality because of claims his parents were from Burkina Faso. 
Tidjane Thiam leads the centre-right PDCI party
Information Minister Coulibaly told the BBC that the nationality law had previously excluded a candidate who had French nationality, in 2011.
""[Thiam] blames the government for a decision taken by the court,"" he added.
""It's an insult to think that when you're in the West, you can comply with the rules, the laws of those countries, and then you arrive in your own country because you think you have power and connections, you can trample on all the texts, flout all the laws,"" said Coulibaly.
But Thiam said his candidacy had rattled the government.
""This government has been in power for 15 years. Do they deserve five more? For me, that's what should be the focus of the presidential campaign, not my passport,"" he said.
He also told the BBC that ""political incidents"" like this could lower investor confidence in the country.
He recounted that a business associate once told him: ""I only invest in countries where I can sue the president's son and win."" This, Thiam told the BBC, had stuck with him.
Thiam comes from a long line of politicians.
His great-uncle - FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny - was Ivory Coast's founding president.
Four of his five brothers, including Thiam himself, have served as ministers under five different presidents.
After becoming the first Ivorian to pass the entrance exam to France's prestigious Polytechnique engineering school, he returned to Ivory Coast and took up politics.
In 1998, aged 36, he became planning minister before the PDCI was ousted from power in a coup the following year.
He then moved abroad and pursued a largely successful business career.
Thiam has held senior positions in leading international businesses like Aviva, Prudential and Credit Suisse. He quit the latter in 2020 following a spying scandal although he has been cleared of any involvement.
In 2020, he was appointed as a special envoy for Covid-19 by the African Union.
However, Thiam has faced criticism from political opponents for having been absent from Ivory Coast for 20 years, which they say means he has poor recognition among Ivorians.
He believes, however, that his years outside his country have, in fact, helped build his profile at home.
""A lot of Ivorians watched my international career. The same way they watched the famous football players, they watched me, they knew me,"" he said.
Thiam (L) had been expected to challenge the incumbent RHDP party, led by current President Alassane Ouattara
Thiam described himself to the BBC as ""a numbers guy"".
""Ivory Coast in 1999 was 125th in the world [In the UNDP Human Development Index]. We are now 166, so we're down 41 spots. We're among the bottom 30 countries in the world,"" said Thiam.
He believes that this is as a direct result of years of political violence.
""The first sentence of my platform is an Ivory Coast at peace inside its borders and at peace with its neighbours,"" explained Thiam.
""Ivory Coast is a mosaic. You go to any part of the country, there are people on both sides of the border who are absolutely similar, speak the same language. So the only viable model for Ivory Coast is to get along well with its neighbours.""
Ivory Coast faces an increasing security threat from Islamist insurgents operating from bordering Mali and Burkina Faso.
In February, France returned its last remaining military base to the Ivorian authorities, partly in response to anger in Ivory Coast over the perceived weakness of the French army in dealing with these groups.
But Thiam denied there was any ""anti-French sentiment"" in Ivory Coast.
""I think what Africans are fed up with is governments that are corrupt and incompetent. When France aligns itself with corruption and incompetence, people will be anti-French and they're absolutely right to do so.""
""Primarily, it's a problem for Africans. It's something we need to solve, and then the rest of the world will also be able to help us solve it. But it has to start with us,"" added Thiam.

751,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyqzllqj7zo,2025-05-02 16:50:23,"Slain Russian journalist's sister on the film preserving her memory,","Slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya 
The thriller about slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, Words of War, opens in US cinemas today. The filmmakers took into account some of the inaccuracy concerns about the script raised by her family, Politkovskaya's sister Elena Kudimova told the BBC.
The film is coming out just in time for the World Press Freedom Day. Words of War was produced by Sean Penn. Anna Politkovskaya is played by Maxine Peake, and one of the leading male roles is performed by Jason Isaacs.
Words of War tells the story of legendary Russian journalist and human rights activist Anna Politkovskaya. 
In Russia, her name is synonymous with courage and an indomitable spirit. She rose to prominence for her investigations into human rights abuses in Chechnya - a region in southern Russia that fought two wars for independence in the 1990s and early 2000s. 
Her older sister, Elena Kudimova, describes her as ""someone who, despite all the threats and the danger to her life, kept doing her work until the very end.""
Politkovskaya openly criticised the Russian authorities and President Putin himself. Despite receiving numerous threats over the years, she refused to back down. 
Her sister recalls that while Politkovskaya considered emigration, she always changed her mind at the last moment. She would say: ""I can't leave because nobody else will help the people here.""
British actress Maxine Peake plays Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya
From 1999, Politkovskaya traveled to Chechnya almost every month for several years. Kudimova recalls that for many wronged and desperate people, Politkovskaya became ""the last resort"" - the one who could make things right. 
She took part in the negotiations for Nord-Ost, the 2002 hostage crisis at a Moscow theatre, after the Chechen rebels specifically requested her. 
In 2004, she hoped to help resolve the crisis in Beslan, where heavily armed militants held hostages in a school for three days. 
However, she never made it there - she was poisoned on the plane while en route to Beslan.
In 2006, Politkovskaya was shot dead in the elevator of her apartment building in Moscow. Six men were convicted over the murder, but the person who ordered it has never been identified. 
Her sister Elena doubts that the mastermind will ever be brought to justice. ""If they had wanted to find him, they probably would have done so by now,"" Kudimova adds.
Jason Isaacs portrays Politkovskaya's husband
Before the film's release, Politkovskaya's family raised concerns about the Words of War script, believing the film took too many liberties with the truth. 
While the filmmakers insist that the drama is based on real events, they emphasise that it is not a biography. 
However, Politkovskaya's sister notes that the filmmakers did take the family's feedback into account, and certain scenes that raised the most questions were removed from the final cut.
""[Anna's son] Ilya was portrayed in the original script as a sort of womanizer, [and in the film] Anna doesn't have a romance with [Dmitry] Muratov,"" she said. 
Dmitry Muratov, a Nobel Prize-winning journalist, was Anna Politkovskaya's former colleague at the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.
According to Kudimova, Maxine Peake portrays her sister accurately, though she believes Anna's personality was ""much greater and more complex"" than what is depicted on screen. 
""Her real life had far more dramatic episodes than those shown in the film,"" she says.
Kudimova criticised the film's setting for leaning too heavily into cold-weather clichÃ©s. 
""I was struck by the fact that it's constantly snowing, as if Russia has only one season. In reality, we have all four."" However, Kudimova is grateful that the film helps preserve the memory of her sister.
Anna Politkovskaya was shot dead in the lift of her Moscow house in 2006.
Kudimova said that Anna never thought about her own legacy. She recalled how, at some point, someone had suggested Anna write an autobiography - she was in her 40s at the time. 
Anna had laughed at the idea, saying it felt more like something you do when you're a hundred. But then she came up with the idea of writing six short stories. 
At the end of each, she said, she was supposed to die - but didn't, for different reasons. And they were going to be funny stories. 
When asked about how Anna would want to be remembered, Elena says that her sister did not think about her legacy: ""She simply wanted to live.""
Words of War will be released in the UK on 30 June"

General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the son of Uganda's president, has confirmed the detention of an opposition leader's bodyguard, who has been missing for five days. 
Edward Sebuufu, alias Eddie Mutwe, was reportedly picked up on Sunday by unidentified individuals in both civilian clothes and military fatigues in the central town of Kiwango, sparking public outrage and concern about his safety. 
In a series of posts on X, Gen Kainerugabai, who is also Uganda's military chief, said Mr Sebuufu was ""in my basement"", attaching the bodyguard's photo with a clean-shaven head. 
He also threatened to use violence against Mr Sebuufu.
Gen Kainerugabai's remarks have sparked public anger with Ugandans using the hashtag #FreeEddieMutwe to demand Mr Sebuufu's release and condemn his detention. 
Gen Kainerugaba frequently makes political comments on social media, which his critics say contravene the military's code of discipline.
He has also made a series of different threats, which he hasn't carried out.
The 51-year-old army general has several times pulled down his X account after posting controversial comments before later returning to the micro-blogging platform. 
He is seen as a possible successor to his long-serving father, Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, who has denied that he is grooming his son for the presidency.
Muhoozi Kainerugaba - Uganda's ambitious tweeting general
In 2022, he made headlines for discussing an invasion of neighbouring Kenya, a comment that forced his father to step in and apologise.
He recently sparked anger with a tweet in which he threatened to behead opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine.
Late on Thursday, he sparked another social media storm after he published a photo  of Mr Sebuufu, Bobi Wine's bodyguard, appearing half-naked and clean shaved. 
Gen Kainerugaba also threatened to castrate Mr Sebuufu.
Bobi Wine said Mr Sebuufu was on Sunday ""violently abducted"" from Kiwango by armed men travelling in a police van, popularly known as ""drone"", before he was whisked to an unknown place. 
In a series of posts, Gen Kainerugaba said his soldiers had captured Mr Sebuufu ""liked a grasshopper"" and he was learning Runyankore, a language spoken in western Uganda, while in custody. 
He said Mr Sebuufu was ""looking very smart these days"" after his beard was shaved by ""my boy"", referring to his junior soldiers. 
The general said he would only release the bodyguard if ordered to do so by his father, President Museveni. 
Gen Kainerugaba did not explicitly state where Mr Sebuufu was being held, or on what legal charges. 
Security forces are yet to comment on the matter but police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke on Monday told local media that he was not aware of Mr Sebuufu being held in any police station. 
Opposition officials and social media users in Uganda have demanded the bodyguard be produced in court if he is in lawful custody.
Following Gen Kainerugaba's X posts, Bobi Wine said soldiers had ""raided and cordoned off"" the headquarters of his National Unity Platform party (NUP).
He had earlier called for a ""solidarity"" rally on Friday in the capital Kampala, accusing Gen Kainerugaba of ""illegally holding, torturing, and dehumanizing"" his bodyguard.  
""This is a non-partisan opportunity to unite. Friends of Eddie and other Ugandans of good conscience, let us come together in solidarity not just with Eddie but all political prisoners!,"" Bobi Wine posted on X. 
In a statement, external, the Uganda Law Society has called for the immediate release of Mr Sebuufu, saying his ordeal was not an isolated case but ""part of a systematic campaign to silence dissent and crush the aspirations of people yearning for freedom"". 
The society feared that the reported involvement of  the army in the matter ""underscores a dangerous nexus of military power and political oppression"". 
Mr Sebuufu, who is in charge of Bobi Wine's personal security detail, has been arrested several times and charged with various offences, including treason and illegal possession of ammunition.  The opposition says his arrests and charges are politically motivated.
He has been a key target in several security crackdowns on opposition activities, especially during elections and mobilisation campaigns, local media reported. 
Bobi Wine, a popular singer who has declared his intention to challenge President Museveni for the second time in the 2026 elections, has often been prevented from holding political rallies.
There are growing concerns about the targeting of opposition figures and supporters by security agencies as political mobilisation intensifies ahead of the elections. 
The government has blamed the opposition for the regular clashes between civilians and the security forces, saying they hold rallies without permission.

753,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgly1yrd9j3o,2025-01-27 11:55:26,"What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?,","The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Numerous armed groups have competed with the central authorities for power and control of the potential fortune in this vast nation.
The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect â notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people.
An upsurge in the conflict since the beginning of this year which saw major advances by a rebel group known as the M23 has renewed attention on the region.
After the M23 captured a number of key cities and towns, talk of a peace deal is now in the air.
The group's first major advance was at the end of January with the taking of Goma â a city in North Kivu province that is home to more than a million people.
Sitting on the border with Rwanda and the shores of Lake Kivu, Goma is a vital trading and transport hub that is within reach of mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand.
In February, the M23 also seized another important city in the region, South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu.
Fighting between the M23 and the Congolese army and allied militia has continued in the region as the rebels attempt to expand their territory.
At one point, they threatened to target the nation's capital, Kinshasa - a city 2,600km (1,600 miles) away, on the other side of this vast country.
The M23 is led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group.
They say that several previous deals to end decades of fighting in the region have not been respected - they take their name from a peace agreement that was signed with a previous Tutsi-led rebel group on 23 March 2009.
Shortly after its creation in 2012, the M23 rapidly gained territory and seized Goma â acts that were met with international opprobrium and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations.
It was forced to withdraw from Goma, and then suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army along with a UN force that saw it expelled from the country.
M23 fighters then agreed to be integrated into the army in return for promises that Tutsis would be protected.
But, in 2021, the group took up arms again, saying the promises had been broken.
M23 leader Sultani Makenga is a Congolese Tutsi who previously fought in the Rwandan army.
Who is Sultani Makenga?
Rwanda has in the past consistently denied that it supported the M23, but ever since 2012 UN experts have accused it of providing weapons, logistical support and even ultimately commanding the rebels.
DR Congo's government, as well as the US and France, have also identified Rwanda as backing the group. Last year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the M23. The UK suspended some aid to Rwanda accusing its army of supporting the rebels.
In February, Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC that the country's troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over to its territory.
Rwanda previously said it was being scapegoated and blamed the recent fighting on the Congolese authorities, saying they had refused to enter into a dialogue with the M23.
The origin of the current fighting can partly be traced back to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
About 800,000 people â mostly from the Tutsi community - were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists.
The genocide ended with the advance of a force of Tutsi-led rebels commanded by Paul Kagame, who is now president.
Fearing reprisals, an estimated one million Hutus then fled across the border to what is now DR Congo. This stoked ethnic tensions as a marginalised Tutsi group in the east â the Banyamulenge â felt increasingly under threat.
Rwanda's army twice invaded DR Congo, saying it was going after some of those responsible for the genocide, and worked with members of the Banyamulenge and other armed groups.
After 30 years of conflict, one of the Hutu groups, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes some of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, is still active in eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda describes the FDLR as a ""genocidal militia"" and says its continued existence in the DR Congo's east threatens its own territory. The Rwandan spokesperson said the FDLR wanted to return to Rwanda to ""finish the job"".
Rwanda accuses the Congolese authorities of working with the FDLR - accusations which DR Congo denies. It is unlikely to stay out of DR Congo unless it is satisfied that the FDLR is no longer a threat to itself, or to the Tutsi communities in eastern DR Congo.
The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo
In recent weeks, there have been rapid developments towards finding a solution to the conflict after months of frustration as efforts, led by Angola, to broker a sustainable ceasefire kept on breaking down.
18 March - Congolese President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi and Kagame called for an ""immediate ceasefire"" after having direct talks in Qatar
23 April - DR Congo and the M23 agreed to halt fighting in the east until Qatar-mediated peace talks reach their ""conclusion""
25 April - DR Congo and Rwanda signed an agreement in Washington to respect each other's sovereignty and come up with a draft peace deal.
Despite these agreements there were reports that fighting was continuing in the east with the M23 taking more villages in South Kivu province. 
Nevertheless, the US, with an eye on striking mineral deals with both countries, is urging DR Congo and Rwanda to sign a deal by July.
DR Congo and multiple UN reports have accused Rwanda of using the conflict as a way of looting Congolese minerals, such as gold and coltan, which is used to make mobile phones and other electronic items such as cameras and inside cars.
In recent years, the M23 has seized several lucrative mining areas and a report by UN experts last December said that around 120 tonnes of coltan was being sent by the M23 to Rwanda every four weeks.
Rwanda has consistently denied allegations of exploiting DR Congo's minerals.
Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo
Meanwhile, the Congolese government is negotiating a minerals deal with the US with the hope that it could help quell the violence. The US is also aiming to make a similar deal with Rwanda, President Donald Trump's senior advisor for Africa Massad Boulos told the Reuters news agency.
Is Trump mulling a minerals deal with conflict-hit DR Congo?
A UN peacekeeping mission has been in place since 1999. The current force â known as Monusco â is made up of more than 10,000 troops.
However, of these, only the Force Intervention Brigade is allowed to carry out offensive operations against armed groups. It was this force that helped defeat the M23 in 2013.
Monusco has been the target of anger from ordinary Congolese who see it as failing to do its job. President Tshisekedi, deeming the mission a failure, had asked it to leave by the end of last year.
But the departure was delayed and in December the mission was extended for another year.
A military force from Southern African Development Community (Sadc), a regional grouping of 16 countries, that was deployed in late 2023 began withdrawing at the end of April.
It had failed to halt the M23 advance and in March its mission was terminated.
This came after 14 South African soldiers were killed in January, along with several more from Malawi and Tanzania.

A prominent Tanzanian Catholic priest and government critic has been violently attacked amid rising political tensions ahead of elections due in October.
Fr Charles Kitima, who had attended an all-day religious meeting, was ambushed by two people at night in a canteen restroom near his residence in Dar es Salaam.
According to the police, he was hit on the head with a blunt object and was later admitted to hospital, where he is in a stable condition.
Eyewitnesses said Fr Kitima had been seen talking to several people before the attack, and was later found bleeding and calling for help, moments after individuals were seen fleeing the scene.
The police say they have detained a suspect, while investigations continue.
The attack on Fr Kitima, who is the secretary-general of the Catholic bishops' organisation, Tanzania Episcopal Conference (TEC), has been widely condemned.
Boniface Mwabukusi, president of the Tanganyika Law Society, who visited the priest in hospital, said it had been ""a brutal attack with the intent to take his life"".
Posting on X, Mwabukusi said Fr Kitima had a message for Tanzanians that ""we should not be afraid to pay the price for standing up for justice and fulfilling our duties to the country"".
Could this be the end of the road for Tanzania's great survivor, Tundu Lissu?
Why Samia's hesitant reforms are fuelling Tanzanian political anger
In a call for a ""transparent investigation"", the US embassy in Tanzania on Friday described the attack as ""shocking and brutal"", external and condemned ""all acts of violence, especially those that aim to silence calls for justice, reconciliation, and human rights"".
Political tension is increasing in Tanzania ahead of the general elections, with rights groups raising concerns over shrinking civic space, accountability, and justice.
Opposition Chadema party vice-chairman John Heche said the incident was bad ""news for the country"". 
Lobby group Legal and Human Rights Centre also condemned the ""heinous attack""  that portrayed a ""bad image"" for the country.
Fr Kitima has frequently criticised government policies and is widely known in Tanzania for his bold stance on democratic reforms and human rights.
The assault, which has alarmed faith leaders and the civil society, comes days after the Catholic Church called for the government to heed calls for electoral reform - a key opposition demand.
Leaders of Christian churches, whose followers make up 60% of the population, have become increasingly outspoken on justice and governance issues.
But their criticism has not been received well by some supporters of the ruling party, with some senior figures asking religious leaders to stay out of politics.
President Samia Suluhu Hassan last weekend warned the opposition that ""no-one is above the law"".
""We must not allow this election to be a cause for conflict,"" she added.
She also sought to downplay fears of rigging by vowing that the government would ""do everything in its power to ensure that the election is free and fair"".
Since last year there has been a wave of attacks and abductions targeting government critics. Senior opposition figures have also been arrested, including Chadema leader Tundu Lissu, who has been charged with treason.
But attacks of this kind on church leaders are uncommon.
Police have said the motive for Fr Kitima's attack is not yet known, with ongoing investigations looking to identify other suspects.
The government has not commented on the attack.
But Stephen Wasira, vice-chairman of the ruling CCM party, condemned it and sent a message of sympathy to the priest.

The mother of a South African girl, who disappeared aged six more than a year ago, has been convicted of kidnapping and trafficking her daughter.
Kelly Smith, her boyfriend Jacquen Appollis and their friend Steveno van Rhyn were arrested after Smith's daughter, Joshlin, went missing from outside her home in Saldanha Bay, near Cape Town, in February last year.
Appollis and Van Rhyn were also found guilty on Friday of kidnapping and trafficking Joshlin. All three had previously pleaded not guilty to to these charges.
Joshlin's disappearance sent shockwaves across South Africa and despite a highly publicised search for her, she is yet to be found.
During the trial, held in March, prosecutors accused Smith of having ""sold, delivered or exchanged"" Joshlin and then lied about her disappearance.
Smith wiped tears from her eyes when the guilty verdict was read, while Van Rhyn inexplicably broke into a smile.
Applause rippled through the packed courtroom and some onlookers began to cry.
Smith's mother was in attendance and after the hearing finished, she said she was ""angry"" with her daughter and did not want to see her.
""She must tell me where my grandchild is,"" Amanda Daniels-Smith told reporters.
Smith, Van Rhyn and Appollis could face life in prison - a date for sentencing is yet to be set. 
In a statement following the judgment, the police said they would continue in their search for Joshlin.
The trial was held in Saldanha's Multipurpose Centre to ""ensure the community has access"" to proceedings, Judge Nathan Erasmus, who presided over the case, said previously.
Ahead of the verdict, nearby roads had been closed, while police officers were deployed in and around the centre.
The trial captivated South Africa, with witnesses and prosecutors making a number of shocking allegations.
The most explosive came from Lourentia Lombaard, a friend and neighbour of Smith who turned state witness.
Ms Lombaard alleged that Smith told her she had done ""something silly"" and sold Joshlin to a traditional healer, known in South Africa as a ""sangoma"".
The ""person who [allegedly took] Joshlin wanted her for her eyes and skin"", Ms Lombaard told the court.
A local pastor testified that in 2023, he had heard Smith - a mother of three - talk of selling her children for 20,000 rand ($1,100; Â£850) each, though she had said she was willing to accept a lower figure of $275.
Joshlin's teacher then alleged in court that Smith had told her during the search that her daughter was already ""on a ship, inside a container, and they were on the way to West Africa"".

Several shocking allegations were made against Kelly Smith, Joshlin's mother, during the trial
Smith's lawyer, Rinesh Sivnarain, cast doubt on these allegations. He cited inconsistencies - recognised by the prosecution - in Ms Lombaard's remarks and suggested she was an ""opportunist"".
Smith, Appollis and Van Rhyn chose not to call any witnesses in their defence and did not take the stand during the trial.
Sangomas are legally recognised in South Africa under the Traditional Health Practitioners Act of 2007, alongside herbalists, traditional birth attendants and traditional surgeons.
Some charlatans are involved in unscrupulous traditional so-called cures, and have been known to sell good luck charms that involve body parts.
The allegation that Smith had discussed selling her daughter and had issues with drugs has prompted conversations about the vulnerability of children, particularly in South Africa's poor communities.
In Joshlin's community of Middelpos, parents have been telling local media that more than a year after the young girl's disappearance, they are still concerned for their own children's safety.

If you're planning on staying up late to watch the results roll in tonight, here's a quick look at what you need to know.
The two main candidates for the prime minister's seat are the current premier Anthony Albanese and his opposition rival Peter Dutton.
Albanese, who heads the Labor party, enjoyed a period of broad popularity after coming to power but in recent years has come under pressure over his handling of divisive topics like housing, Indigenous affairs and both antisemitism and Islamophobia.
Dutton, who is head of the Liberal-National coalition, is known as a staunch conservative and has experience holding important ministerial portfolios, like defence and home affairs. However, he has been a controversial figure at times, particularly on social issues.
There are also the left-leaning Greens, Australia's third largest political party, as well as a wave of ""Teal candidates"" - independent candidates who have been running on a strong climate platform.
Wherever you are in Australia, polls close at 18:00 - but the country's three different time zones means there isn't one standard time where all polls shut.
The eastern states of Australia - New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland which follow Australian Eastern Standard Time - will be among the first places to close at 18:00 local time, or 08:00 GMT.
Next will come South Australia, as well as the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, followed by the state of Western Australia.
The last polling booths - in the ting, far-flung Australian territory of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands - will close 12.30 GMT.
Wherever you are in Australia, polls close at 6pm
Unlike most countries including the US and UK, exit polls aren't big in Australia, mostly because early voting - which opens two weeks before the election - is common, and because polling stations across the country close at different times.
But counting in each state begins straight after polls close. Results are updated in real time on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website - in what is known as an unofficial preliminary count, with Australians typically getting an unofficial result the same night.
The AEC also provides what's known as an ""indicative count"", which media commentators, election experts and sometimes even the parties and candidates themselves then base their calls on.
This sees counting officers conduct what is called a two-candidate-preferred count between the two leading candidates in each electoral district. This gives citizens a quick indication of who could form the government.
Australian pollsters also have a good track record of picking political winners, with a 96% success rate between 2007 and 2016, according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The exception was in 2019, when polls showed Labor to be ahead - but the election was won by then Coalition prime minister Scott Morrison.
It is usually days or weeks before an official result is released by the AEC as they have to go through a rigorous counting process, tallying approximately 18 million ballot papers by hand, including postal and overseas ballot papers.
But citizens usually look to media outlets and election experts - like Australia's national broadcaster ABC - to call the unofficial results on election night.
In the last election in 2022, the ABC announced the results at 21:30 - just three and a half hours after polls closed on the east coast.
And as the night goes on, parties also come out to declare their win - or loss - so it might play out in the form of a victory speech, or in one conceding defeat.
There is no one specific time when the results are called, but 2022 gives a sense of how quickly we might be able see a winner. However if it proves to be a tight race, this process could take quite a while longer.
In the case of a hung parliament, it might take days or weeks before a result is called. In 2010, which is the last time Australia had a hung parliament, it took 17 days of post-election negotiations for a government to be formed - with both the Labor Party and the Coalition vying to win the support of six crossbenchers.  In the end, Labor was able to form a minority government.
So depending on the scenario that plays out, Australians might have to hang on to their edge of their seats for a while longer before an official result emerges."

A man has been given a life sentence after pleading guilty to murdering a woman in the Republic of Ireland more than two years ago. 
Geila Ibram, who was 27 and originally from Romania, was stabbed five times at her apartment in Limerick city on 4 April 2023. 
28-year-old Habib Shah Shamel appeared in the dock of Belfast Crown Court from custody to be formally arraigned on two charges.
When the charge of murdering Ms Ibram was put to him in court, Shamel, an Afghani national formerly of Cecil Street in Limerick, replied through an interpreter: ""I am guilty''.
Shamel had arranged by text to meet Ms Ibram for sex, senior prosecutor David McDowell KC told the court.
""He arrived at the flat and paid her â¬100. She gave the money to a colleague,'' he said. 
Mr McDowell said that ""several seconds later this colleague heard screams and it was apparent he had stabbed Ms Ibram"".
""The fatal injury was to the chest which went through her lungs and entered her heart. Death was as a result of blood loss due to multiple stab wounds,"" he said. 
Mr McDowell said the ""fact that he stabbed"" Ms Ibram within seconds of meeting her ""invites the obvious inference that he came there to kill her"".
Shamel fled the scene and went to Dublin before heading to Belfast via bus. 
He was stopped by the PSNI in a car on the Malone Road in south Belfast just before 15:30 on 6 April 2023.
During interviews with police, Shamel said he had gone to the escort to ""satisfy his sexual needs'' because of something he had viewed online.
When he was arrested, the PSNI seized a rucksack. They found a notebook which contained a handwritten letter to Shamel's mother in which he expressed a desire to ""sacrifice his life to Allah''.
The bag also contained a USB stick which had alleged terrorist-related videos of executions, dismemberment, encouragement to support Jihad, instructions on how to construct and detonate an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), the court heard. 
Mr McDowell said there were also videos of suicide bombers.
When the charge of possessing a ""document or record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, namely files within a USB'', Shamel replied: ""I am not guilty.''
The court heard a trial date had been set for 8 September 2025. It is expected to last two weeks.
Defence barrister Chris Sherrard said he would be seeking expert witnesses as rebuttal to two prosecution experts who have made reports on the contents of the USB stick.
Following his guilty plea to murdering Ms Ibram, Mr Justice O'Hara told the defendant: ""Mr Shamel, since you have pleaded guilty to the murder of Ms Ibram in April 2023 I must now impose on you a sentence of life imprisonment.""
The judge said there will be a subsequent hearing ""at which I will set the number of years which you must serve before your release can be considered"". 
""However number of years that will be, you will serve a very long period of time in prison before consideration of your release ever comes around.''
The judge postponed the life sentence tariff hearing until after the September trial.
He added that he would review the case of possessing documents likely to be of use to terrorists in three weeks' time.
Mr Shamel was charged under the Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975, which allows the PSNI to prosecute in Northern Ireland if a suspect has fled from a different jurisdiction."

Last year, three Nigerian oversight agencies imposed fines on the US-based social media giant totalling more than $290m (Â£218m) for violating various laws and regulations.
Meta was unsuccessful in a recent attempt to challenge the decisions in the Abuja High Court.
""The applicant may be forced to effectively shut down the Facebook and Instagram services in Nigeria in order to mitigate the risk of enforcement measures,"" the company reportedly said in court papers.
Meta also owns WhatsApp, but it did not mention the messaging service in its statement.
The high court has given the company until the end of June to pay the fines.
The BBC has asked Meta for comment.
Facebook is by far the most popular social media platform in Nigeria and is used by tens of millions in the country for daily communication and sharing news. It is also a vital tool for many of Nigeria's small online businesses.
In July last year, Meta was asked to pay three fines:
The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) imposed a $220m fine for alleged anti-competitive practices
The advertising regulator fined the company $37.5m over unapproved advertising
And the Nigerian Data Protection Commission (NDPC) alleged Meta had violated data privacy laws and fined it $32.8m.
FCCPC chief executive officer Adamu Abdullahi said investigations carried out in conjunction with the data commission between May 2021 and December 2023 revealed ""invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria"" but was not specific about what these were.
In its court submission, Meta said its ""primary concern"" was with the data commission, which it accused of ""misinterpreting"" data privacy laws.
Specifically, the commission has demanded that Meta seek prior approval before transferring any personal data out of Nigeria - a condition that Meta called ""unrealistic"".
The data commission also imposed other demands.
Meta was told it must provide an icon linking to educational videos about data privacy risks. This would be content created in collaboration with government-approved educational institutions and non-profit organisations.
The NDPC insisted that these videos highlight the dangers of ""manipulative and unfair data processing"" that could expose Nigerian users to health and financial risks.
Meta described the NDPC's demands as unfeasible, saying that the agency has failed to ""properly interpret the laws guiding data privacy"".
Update 8 May: This article originally reported that Meta had said in court papers that people in Nigeria may lose access to Facebook and Instagram. We have updated it to attribute the source of this quote to Africa Report.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said its ship The Conscience was targeted at 00:23 local time on Friday and issued an SOS signal right after the attack. 
The BBC was sent a recording of the distress call from the flotilla ship, recorded by a crew member on a nearby oil tanker. The captain of the flotilla ship can clearly be heard reporting drone strikes and a fire onboard.
The Maltese government said everyone aboard the ship was ""confirmed safe"" and that a fire onboard the ship was ""brought under control overnight"".
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition said it had planned to sail to Gaza with people including climate activist Greta Thunberg on board and ""challenge Israel's illegal siege and blockade"".
The NGO called for Israeli ambassadors to be summoned to answer for ""violation of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel"".
The Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the attack.
Organisers told the BBC that the group had been ""operating in total secrecy with a complete media blackout"" to prevent ""sabotage"" as they prepared to sail towards Gaza - where about two million Palestinians have been under a complete blockade by the Israeli military for two months.
Volunteer Surya McEwen said he and others had lost contact with the ship after the incident, which he said caused a fire on board and damaged the hull. They had since been told there were no major injuries.
""It's a full-on situation for them but they're recovering,"" he told the BBC, adding that the incident had been an ""unprovoked attack on a civilian vessel in international waters, trying to do a humanitarian mission"".
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was among those who had planned to board the ship once it departed for Gaza on Friday.  
Speaking to journalists in Valetta, she said: ""I was part of the group who was supposed to board that boat today to continue the voyage towards Gaza, which is one of many attempts to open up a humanitarian corridor and to do our part to keep trying to break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza.""
Thunberg added that as far as she's aware, the ship is still at the location of the attack because moving it would let too much water in.
""What is certain is that we human rights activists will continue to do everything in our power to do our part, to demand a free Palestine and demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor,"" she said.
The Maltese government said that 12 crew and four activists were on board the boat, while the NGO said 30 activists had been on board.
The Freedom Flotilla Coalition uploaded a video showing a fire on the ship. It said the attack appeared to have targeted the generator, which left the ship without power and at risk of sinking. 
Firefighters try to extinguish the blaze on board the Conscience
The Maltese government said a tugboat was sent to the scene to extinguish the fire, which they say was under control by 01:28 local time.
""By 2:13, all crew were confirmed safe but refused to board the tug,"" the statement said, adding the ship remains outside territorial waters.
Cyprus responded to the SOS signal by dispatching a vessel, the activists said, but that it did not ""provide the critical electrical support needed"". 
Marine tracking software shows that the Conscience left Tunisia on Tuesday evening and is currently around 12-14 nautical miles off Malta.
The coalition is campaigning to end Israel's blockade of Gaza, which is also facing mounting international condemnation. Last month the UK, French and German foreign ministers described the Israeli decision to block aid as ""intolerable"".
Gaza kitchens warn food will run out in days after two months of Israeli blockade
Two months ago, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza â preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and later resumed its military offensive, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. 
Some humanitarian organisations such as the World Food Programme say they have already run out of food while community kitchens say their stocks are dwindling fast. On Friday the Red Cross said the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the verge of ""total collapse"".
The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 52,418 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

A politician wants to make sure French day trippers can still use ID cards to travel to Jersey after new rules came in for European passport holders.
Since 2 April, most have needed an Electronic Travel Authorisation before getting to the UK border.
French day trippers coming directly to Jersey will not need one until at least the autumn and deputy Sir Philip Baillache is asking the home affairs minister to extend the scheme beyond then.
In a report to the States, Baillache said rules which came into force post-Brexit meant French citizens visiting Jersey could no longer use their identity cards, but instead required a passport.
""The result was that the number of French day-trippers plummeted,"" he said.
""There is no doubt that the increase in numbers during 2023 and 2024 was due to action taken by the minister's predecessor, deputy Helen Miles, to permit French national identity cards to be used for travel instead of, or as well as, a passport.
""The scheme has worked for two years without any untoward consequences, and there is no reason to believe that it would not continue to do so if the dispensation remained in place,"" he added.

It is the first time the relatives of an ""absconder"" have been charged under the territory's security law, Reuters news agency said.
The authorities accused Ms Kwok, 26, of breaching Hong Kong's national security laws after participating in pro-democracy protests in 2019.
She fled the territory in 2020 and now serves as the Executive Director of the Hong Kong Democracy Council (HKDC), an organisation based in Washington DC.
Police said they had arrested two men aged 35 and 68 on suspicion of handling ""funds or other financial assets"" belonging to Kwok, Reuters said.
Local media later identified the two men as relatives of Ms Kwok, citing police sources.
According to a report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), police launched an investigation into the pair after observing they had met Ms Kwok overseas.
The 68-year-old, identified by local media as Ms Kwok's father Kwok Yin-sang, is accused of helping his daughter handle her insurance policy upon his return to Hong Kong.
According to a charge sheet seen by Reuters, Kwok Yin-sang had been trying to access Ms Kwok's life and personal accident insurance policy which could be used to obtain funds on her behalf.
He has been denied bail by national security judge Victor So at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts, Reuters reported.
The 35-year-old man, identified by local media as Ms Kwok's brother, is accused of supporting their father's attempts to retrieve the money, Reuters said.
He has reportedly been released on bail pending further investigation.
Under Hong Kong's Safeguarding National Security Bill, it is illegal to ""make available, directly or indirectly, any funds or other financial assets or economic resources to, or for the benefit of, a relevant absconder"".
In 2023, Hong Kong placed a bounty on the heads of several pro-democracy activists - including Ms Kwok - who had fled the territory. 
The eight activists targeted were accused of colluding with foreign forces - a crime that can carry a sentence of life in prison.
At the time, Ms Kwok said the bounty was aimed at intimidating her and her fellow activists.
""That's exactly the kind of thing the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist party would do - which is to intimidate people into not doing anything, silencing them,"" she told BBC's Newshour at the time.
The former British colony became a special administrative region of China in 1997, when Britain's 99-year lease of the New Territories, north of Hong Kong island, expired.
Hong Kong still enjoys freedoms not seen in mainland China, but they are widely thought to be on the decline."

Three people have been arrested in the Republic of Ireland after a van was driven through a perimeter fence at Shannon Airport in County Clare.
The incident happened at about 18:30 local time on Thursday and caused the airport to close for a short time, preventing a number of flights from landing. 
The van is believed to have been driven across a grass area beside the main road into the airport before it crashed through a perimeter fence.
While it breached the fence, the van was stopped from going any further by a trench. 
It is believed a number of people wearing orange jump suits, hard hats and scarves then headed towards a taxiway near the runway before being seen, Irish national broadcaster RTÃ reported.
Protest group Palestine Action Ãire claimed responsibility in a statement.
An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) said officers responded to an incident of criminal damage at the airport and that three people arrested remain in custody.
Shannon Airport said there were ""minimal delays of ten minutes to two flights"" when the incident happened and that it is operating a normal schedule on Friday. 
The airport has long been the site of protests over its use by the US military.
The Irish government offered the use of the airport to the United States in 2002 after the September 11 attacks, leading to it being used as a regular stopover for US troops travelling to fight in the Iraq War.
Anti-war protesters and, in more recent years, pro-Palestine protesters have made the airport a regular site of demonstrations over those connections with the US."

The victory-party din for Mark Carney and his Liberal Party had only just faded when Donald Trump chimed in with a less than ringing endorsement of the winners.
""It was the one that hated Trump, I think, the least that won,"" the US president said on Wednesday of Carney, whose party had just retained power by winning a near outright majority of the seats in Canada's general election.
The Canadian prime minister may accept being the lesser of two evils in Trump's mind, however. The US president also said that he thinks the former Bank of England governor ""couldn't have been nicer"" in the first post-election phone conversation.
The two men are expected to meet at the White House sometime within the next week.
For Trump, politics is often personal. The president's affinity for Vladimir Putin colours US relations with Russia, for instance. His respect for Xi Jinping has kept US-China relations on a relatively even keel even as the two nations are engaging in an extended trade war.
Canada, on the other hand, has spent an extended time on the other end of this equation. Trump's distaste for former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was palpable practically from the US president's first day in office in 2017.
The two leaders did not see eye to eye in Trump's first term - then things got worse
Their lengthy, aggressive handshake during their first in-person visit just a few weeks after Trump's inauguration foreshadowed what would be a long and trying relationship.
It was punctuated by passive-aggressive jabs, snide comments and, upon Trump's return to the White House, the president's derisive reference to ""Governor Trudeau"" and repeated talk of turning Canada into America's ""cherished 51st state"".
Trump's annexation talk continued even after Trudeau was replaced by Carney, but the temperature has seemed to drop somewhat, as the smooth international banker with a Harvard and Oxford pedigree replaced the younger, boyishly good looking Trudeau.
Why young voters flocked to Canada's Conservatives
How Canada voted - in charts
Trump, while he likes to rail against global elites, is drawn to Ivy League backgrounds and accumulated wealth, which Carney has in spades. And Carney has another attribute Trump tends to value - he's now a winner. 
Even if he owes some of his victory to Trump's (negative) influence, the Liberal leader did engineer a remarkable reversal of fortune for his party when the outlook appeared gloomy just a few months before.
Carney and Trump are still a study in contrasts, something that presents risk for the former as their first meeting looms. The Canadian is measured, controlled and organised. Trump is impulsive and unpredictable. Both can be impatient at times, with little tolerance for the trivialities of modern politics.
There were reports that Trump brought up annexation during his first conversation with Carney after he became prime minister, but the Canadian leader kept that to himself and word only leaked weeks later - a characteristically cool response that may offer a hint of how he will handle Trump's bluster.
Paul Samson, president of the Centre for International Governance Innovation who has held various senior positions in Canadian government over 30 years, has seen Carney in action first-hand.
He tells the BBC that the new Canadian prime minister will likely use a mix of ""economic knowledge, strategy and personal diplomacy"" to get on Trump's good side.
""Carney likes to get things done,"" Mr Samson said. He is also calm, easy going and could connect with Trump on a personal level. ""But he certainly does not want to come across as subservient.""
What will your message be when you meet Trump? Watch the BBC interview with Carney
If Carney heads into his first full term in office with a somewhat cleaner slate in dealing with the US president, it will still be a precarious situation. 
While Canada has won a reprieve from some of the most onerous tariffs Trump initially announced on his nation, the clock is ticking - and striking some kind of settlement with the Americans will be no easy task.
""We will have a partnership on our terms,"" Carney told the BBC on Tuesday. ""I would distinguish between what the president wants and what he expects.""
Carney went on to say that Trump's ""territorial views"" on his country are ""never, ever going to happen"". It was a familiar message, one he delivered repeatedly on the campaign trail and in his election night victory speech.
""America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,"" he said on Monday. ""But these are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us.""
Carney's rejection of an American takeover of Canada may not be enough to satisfy the US president, however. And it may not be possible for Carney and the Canadians to determine exactly what it is that Trump expects, either.
He has said Canada must do more to limit undocumented migration into the US, which is low, and cross-border fentanyl drug trafficking, which is minimal. He has also inflated the US-Canada trade deficit and said that the nation is ""ripping off"" America. Given the population disparity between the two nations and Canada's vast natural resources, a balanced trade ledger between the two could be an unreachable ask.
Whatever Trump and the Americans ultimately want, the US, as Canada's largest export market, has considerable power over its northern neighbour should it wish to exercise it. But, as Carney noted in his talk with the BBC, Canada isn't powerless either.
""We are the biggest client for more than 40 states,"" he said. ""We supply them with vital energy, conventional energy and potentially could supply them with critical minerals.""
He also said Canada could look to ""like-minded countries"" for more reliable trading partners, such as the UK or the EU, cutting the US out of the equation.
Doing so, however, would be abandoning a long and reliable partnership with the US, one that had been based on shared ideals as well as shared geography.
Trump's first 100 days back in the White House has called all of that into question, however. 
It's a rift that seems unlikely to be fully mended, no matter how well Trump and Carney hit it off when they sit down in person to talk.

A hot meal is hard to come by in the Gaza Strip, but a lunch for needy families in the south is about to be delivered by donkey and cart.
Today's dish is koshari - made with lentils, rice and a zesty tomato sauce - in a set of huge cooking pots in one of two community kitchens run by American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), a US-based humanitarian organisation.
""People rely on our meals; they have no source of income to buy what's left in the local markets and many foods are not available,"" says Sami Matar, who leads the Anera team.
""In the past we used to cook rice with meat - with protein. Now, because of the closure, there's no type of meat, no fresh vegetables.""
Two months after Israel cut off all supplies from entering Gaza, Mr Matar is warning that the few dozen remaining food kitchens are set to close in days.
""The coming days will be critical. We expect we have two weeks' supply, maybe less.""
Sami Matar showed a local BBC journalist around the empty Anera warehouse
On 2 March, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza - preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering - and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said these steps were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the hostages it still holds.
Recently, the UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said they had used up all their stocks of food aid.
There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that mass starvation could be imminent and that intentionally starving civilians is a war crime.
""Aid, and the civilian lives it saves, should never be a bargaining chip,"" the UN's humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned on Thursday.
""Blocking aid starves civilians. It leaves them without basic medical support. It strips them of dignity and hope. It inflicts a cruel collective punishment. Blocking aid kills.""
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are relying on community kitchens for their survival
Hundreds of thousands of Gazans depend on a few dozen remaining kitchens for sustenance. The one run by Anera in Khan Younis feeds some 6,000 people a day.
But if Israel does not lift its blockade, by far the longest it has ever imposed on Gaza, the kitchens - a last lifeline for so many - will soon have nothing to distribute. Food stockpiled during the ceasefire at the start of this year, has all but run out.
""We used to receive more than 100 trucks every week - trucks of food parcels and hygiene kits. Now we don't have anything,"" Mr Matar says as he shows a local BBC journalist around the vast, empty Anera warehouse.
""We struggle to provide food such as rice, lentils, pasta, cooking oil and salt, for our community kitchens. It's very expensive to buy 1kg of wood and we need over 700kg a day for cooking.""
A displaced mother said there was no cooking gas or food to make meals for her family
Israel has accused Hamas of stealing and storing humanitarian aid to give to its fighters or sell to raise money. The UN and other agencies deny aid has been diverted and say that they have strict monitoring mechanisms.
""We work hard to avoid any interference from any parties. We have an accurate and strong distribution process,"" says Mr Matar, inspecting lists of aid recipients on his computer.
""We have a database of hundreds of thousands of people, including their names, ID numbers and addresses - the co-ordinates of the camps. This avoids duplication with the work of other non-governmental organisations and ensures transparency.""
This week, aid workers have said there were five cases of looting at warehouses and the main Unrwa complex in Gaza.
A UN official said it was a sign of people's growing desperation and ""systemic collapse"".
Back in the outdoor kitchen, Mr Matar tests the food from the steaming pots to check its quality. Parcels are wrapped up for distribution; each can serve up to four people.
All the workers receive food for their own hungry families. 
The rest is soon transferred on the donkey cart through the bustling streets to al-Mawasi, a crowded tent camp for displaced people on the coast, where dozens of field monitors supervise the hand-out.
An elderly man walking with crutches looks relieved as he clutches two parcels of koshari to feed his family of seven. ""Thank God, this will be enough,"" he says.
""Don't even ask me about the situation,"" he goes on. ""We're only alive because death hasn't taken us yet. I swear I was searching for a loaf of bread since the morning, and I found none.""
Each of the parcels of food can serve up to four people
""The situation is tragic, and it keeps worsening,"" comments a weary looking mother. ""Life is humiliating here. We have men who are unable to work. There is no income, and all the products are so expensive. We're unable to buy anything.""
""At this time, this is excellent,"" she says of the warm meal she has just been given. ""Because there is no cooking gas, no food. When we want to have a cup of tea, I collect leaves to start a fire.""
It has now been more than a year and a half since the war in Gaza began, triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel. That assault killed around 1,200 people and more than 250 people were taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, with up to 24 of those believed to be alive.
Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,400 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More than 90% of the 2.1 million population has been displaced - with many forced to flee multiple times.
The UN has warned that the current situation ""is likely the worst it has been"" due to the blockade, the renewed offensive and evacuation orders that have displaced some 500,000 people since 18 March.
Anera distributes the food to tents in al-Mawasi rather than requiring people to queue for food at the kitchen
There is growing international pressure on Israel to lift its blockade, with warnings that intentionally starving civilians is a potential war crime. The UN says that Israel has a clear obligation under international law as an occupying power to allow and facilitate aid for Gazans.
Last Friday, US President Donald Trump said he had told Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu that ""we've got to be good to Gaza"" and pushed him to allow more food and medicine into the strip.
There was no official response to that, but earlier in the week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism from the UK, France and Germany, which described the blockade as ""intolerable"" in a joint statement and insisting ""this must end.""
The ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of goods had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. It added: ""Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid.""
Israeli officials have indicated they plan to overhaul the aid distribution system.
For now, supplies are piling up at Gaza's border crossings waiting to be brought in, while inside the territory, aid workers carefully ration what is left of their stock.
In al-Mawasi camp, children gather playfully around Sami Matar and the Anera workers giving out the last of the day's food parcels.
Many are painfully thin, with new warnings of acute malnutrition in Gaza - especially among the young.
Sami Matar appealed to Israel to reopen Gaza's crossings
""I don't know what will happen if our supplies end,"" says Mr Matar, weighed down by the responsibility of his work. 
""The feeling of having to stop this vital help to people would be so stressful and depressing to me and my staff.""
""We have an urgent appeal,"" he continues. ""Look at us, see our desperation, understand that time is running out. Please we just need to open the crossings again."""

Shabir Ahmad Dar, a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, has been selling pashmina shawls for more than 20 years.
The intricately embroidered featherweight scarves are a favourite with his customers in Mussoorie, a hill town in the northern state of Uttarakhand, where he works.
For his buyers, the shawls are a sign of luxury. For Dar, they are a metaphor for home; its traditional patterns layered with history and a mark of his Kashmiri identity.
But lately, the same identity feels like a curse.
On Sunday, Dar, along with another salesman, was publicly harassed and assaulted by members of a Hindu right-wing group, who were reportedly incensed by the killing of 26 people at a popular tourist spot in Kashmir last week. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack - a charge Islamabad denies.
A video of the assault shows the men thrashing and hurling abuses at Dar and his friend as they ransack their stall, located on a busy boulevard.
""They blamed us for the attack, told us to leave town and never show our faces again,"" said Dar. 
He says his goods, worth thousands of dollars, are still lying there. ""But we are too scared to go back.""
As outrage over the assault spread, police on Wednesday arrested the three men but released them a few hours later after charging a fine and asking them to ""apologise"" to Dar and his colleague.
But Dar had already left by then, along with dozens of other Kashmiri shawl sellers, who, after living in Mussoorie for decades, say they no longer feel safe there.
Additional security forces have been deployed in Indian-administered Kashmir since the killings
Many survivors of the Pahalgam attack -  the deadliest targeting civilians in recent years - said the militants specifically targeted Hindu men, sparking an outpouring of anger and grief in India, with politicians across party lines demanding strict action. 
Since then, there have been more than a dozen reports of Kashmiri vendors and students in Indian cities facing harassment, vilification and threats from right-wing groups - but also from their own classmates, customers and neighbours. Videos showing students being chased out of campus and beaten up on the streets have been cascading online.
On Thursday, one of the survivors, whose naval officer husband was killed in the militant attack, appealed to people, external to not go after Muslims and Kashmiris. ""We want peace and only peace,"" she said. 
But safety concerns have forced many Kashmiris like Dar to return home.
Ummat Shabir, a nursing student at a university in Punjab state, said some women in her neighbourhood accused her of being a ""terrorist who should be thrown out"" last week.
""The same day, my classmate was forced out of a taxi by her driver after he found out she was a Kashmiri,"" she said. ""It took us three days to travel back to Kashmir but we had no option. We had to go.""
Ms Shabir is back in her hometown but for many others, even home does not feel safe anymore.
As the search for the perpetrators of last week's attack continues, security forces in Kashmir have detained thousands of people, shut off more than 50 tourist destinations, sent in additional army and paramilitary troops, and blown up several homes belonging to families of suspected militants who they accuse of having ""terrorist affiliations"".
The crackdown has sparked fear and unease among civilians, many of whom have called the actions a form of ""collective punishment"" against them. 
Without mentioning the demolitions, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the guilty must be punished without mercy, ""but don't let innocent people become collateral damage"". Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti also criticised the demolitions, cautioning the government to distinguish between ""terrorists and civilians"".
""Whenever tensions escalate, we are the first ones to bear the brunt of it. But we are still treated as suspects and expected to put our lives on hold,"" another student, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC.
The attack in Pahalgam was the deadliest on civilians in decades
Yet the backlash feels a lot worse this time, says Shafi Subhan, a shawl seller from the region's Kupwara district, who also worked in Mussoorie.
In his 20 years of doing business there, Subhan said he had never faced any public threat - not even after the 2019 terror attack in Pulwama district, which killed 40 paramilitary police troopers.
To him, Mussoorie felt like home, a place where he found peace - despite being hundreds of kilometres away. He said he shared an emotional bond with his customers, who came from all parts of the country
""People were always kind to us, they wore our garments with so much joy,"" Subhan recalled. ""But on that day when our colleagues were attacked, no one came to help. The public just stood and watched. It hurt them physically - but emotionally, a lot more.""
Back home in Kashmir, peace has long been fragile. Both India and Pakistan claim the territory in full but administer separate parts, and an armed insurgency has simmered in the Indian-administered region for more than three decades, claiming thousands of lives.
Caught in between, are civilians who say they feel stuck in an endless limbo that feels especially suffocating, whenever ties between India and Pakistan come under strain.
Many allege that in the past, military confrontations between the nations have been followed by waves of harassment and violence against Kashmiris, along with a significant security and communication clampdown in the region.

Several homes allegedly belonging to suspected militants have been razed down
In recent years, violence has declined, and officials point to improved infrastructure, tourism, and investment as signs of greater stability, particularly since 2019, when the region's special constitutional status was revoked under Article 370.
But arrests and security operations continue, and critics argue that calm has come at the cost of civil liberties and political freedoms.
""The needle of suspicion is always on locals, even as militancy has declined in the last one-and-a-half decades,"" says Anuradha Bhasin, the managing editor of the Kashmir Times newspapers. ""They always have to prove their innocence.""
As the news of the killings spread last week, Kashmiris poured onto the streets, holding candlelight vigils and protest marches. A complete shutdown was observed a day after the attack and newspapers printed black front pages. Omar Abdullah publicly apologised, external, saying he had ""failed his guests"".
Ms Bhasin says Kashmiri backlash against such attacks is not new; there has been similar condemnation in the past as well, although at a smaller scale. ""No one there condones civilian killings - they know the pain of losing loved ones too well.""
But she adds that it's unfair to place the burden of proving innocence on Kashmiris, when they have themselves become targets of hate and violence. ""This would just instil more fear and further alienate people, many of whom already feel isolated from the rest of the country.""
Kashmiris have held widespread protests against the militant attack
Mirza Waheed, a Kashmiri novelist, believes Kashmiris are ""particularly vulnerable as they are seen through a different lens"", being part of India's Muslim population. 
""The saddest part is many of them will suffer the indignity and humiliation, lay low for some time, and wait for this to tide over because they have a life to live.""
No one knows this better Mohammad Shafi Dar, a daily wage worker in Kashmir's Shopian, whose house was blown up by security forces last week.
Five days on, he is still picking the up the pieces. 
""We lost everything,"" said Dar, who is now living under the open sky with his wife, three daughters and son. ""We don't even have utensils to cook food.""
He says his family has no idea where their other 20-year-old son is, whether he joined militancy, or is even dead or alive. His parents say the college student left home last October and never returned. They haven't spoken since. 
""Yet, we have been punished for his alleged crimes. Why?"""

Thai prosecutors have said they will not pursue charges against an American academic who was arrested last month under a strict law against defaming the monarchy.
Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University, was arrested after the army filed a complaint against him.
On Thursday, prosecutors said they would request for charges against him to be dropped, though this has to be reviewed by the police. If they disagree, the decision will fall to the attorney-general. 
Mr Chambers' arrest marked a rare instance of a foreigner being charged under the lese-majeste law, which the government says is necessary to protect the monarchy but critics say is used to clamp down on free speech.
""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" said the Office of the Attorney-General, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.
Mr Chambers first lived and worked in Thailand 30 years ago, and in recent years has been lecturing and researching at Naresuan University in northern Thailand. He is one of the world's foremost experts on the Thai military.
The complaint against him centres on a notice for an academic webinar organised by a Singapore research institute about Thailand's military and police reshuffles. Mr Chambers was one of the webinar's speakers.
The army had accused Mr Chambers of ""defamation, contempt or malice"" towards the royal family, ""importing false computer data"" in a way ""likely to damage national security or cause public panic"", and disseminating computer data ""that may affect national security"", according to a letter from police that was received by the university's social sciences faculty. 
Mr Chambers stated that he did not write or publish the notice for the webinar. The army based its complaint on a Facebook post by a Thai royalist, who translated the webinar notice into Thai.
Thailand's lese-majeste law has been in place since the creation of the country's first criminal code in 1908, although the penalty was toughened in 1976.
Since late 2020, the legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR) has seen more than 300 cases of lese-majeste involving more than 270 people, including 20 children under the age of 18, said Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, the group's advocacy lead.
Last year, a reformist political party was dissolved by court order after the court ruled the party's campaign promise to change lese-majeste was unconstitutional.
The European Parliament called on Thailand last month to reform the law, which it said was ""among the strictest in the world"", and grant amnesty to those prosecuted and imprisoned under it."

But the country's 18 million eligible voters won't just be going to pick their preferred candidate - they'll also be fulfilling a legal obligation.
Since 1924, voting has been compulsory for all Australian citizens over the age of 18, with failure to vote carrying a fine of A$20 ($13; Â£10).
Today, while many countries are struggling to get people to the ballot box, Australia boasts one of the highest voter turnouts in the world.
The country's last federal election in 2022 saw ballots counted from around 90% of eligible voters, according to official statistics.
For comparison, the voter turnout for the UK general election in 2024 was 60%, while the figure for the US presidential election in the same year was 64%.
Compulsory voting has broad popular support in Australia, and is seen as a way to capture representation from the majority of society - not just the majority of people who choose to vote.
Here's what you need to know about compulsory voting in Australia.
You can be exempted from voting with a valid reason, but Australian authorities have put in place a variety of policies to reduce barriers to voting. For one, elections are held on Saturdays, when more workers will be free to go down to polling stations.
Employers are also required to give workers paid leave on election day to ensure that people have enough time to go vote.
An added incentive for people to perform their democratic duty are ""democracy sausages"", grilled on barbeques near polling booths. These snacks have become icons of Australian elections, often making them the largest fundraising events of the year for local schools and community groups.
All eligible Australian citizens are required to vote in federal elections, by-elections and referendums
Voting became compulsory for federal elections when the Electoral Act was amended in 1924, and the effect was swift and stark: voter turnout surged from less than 60% in the 1922 election to more than 91% in 1925.
A big argument for compulsory voting in Australia is the legitimacy it grants the election winner. 
""Proponents of compulsory voting argue that a parliament elected by a compulsory vote more accurately reflects the will of the electorate,"" reads a guide published by the Australian Election Commission.
""Compulsory voting is claimed to encourage policies which collectively address the full spectrum of elector values,"" said the commission. On the flipside, it notes, compulsory voting also runs the risk of ""pork barrelling"" - the use of government funds for projects that will curry favour with voters - as parties focus on winning over voters on the margins.
While there is no scientific consensus on how compulsory voting affects the policy issues championed by political parties, many believe it counters political polarisation by drawing out more moderate voters.
Conversely, places without compulsory voting may see parties appealing to more extreme voter bases.
""That means they can be tempted towards much more extreme political issues,"" historian Judith Brett told the BBC in 2022, when the last Australian federal election was held. ""Whereas because everybody has to vote, in a way it pulls politics towards the centre.""
Compulsory voting also helps ensure that marginalised people are better represented, said Ms Brett. Research shows that people who are less affluent are also less likely to vote.
""Now that means that politicians, when they're touting for votes, know that all of the groups, including the poor, are going to have a vote,"" Brett said. ""And I think that makes for a more egalitarian public policy.""
Compulsory voting is fairly uncontroversial in Australia. 
National surveys since 1967 show public support for the laws have consistently hovered around 70%.
Over the decades there have been individuals campaigning to end compulsory voting, arguing that citizens should have the right to choose whether to vote at all - but such calls have gained little traction among the wider population.
In 2022, 77% of Australians said they would have still voted if it was voluntary."

Ten people have been killed and more than 30 injured after a bus hit several vehicles at a toll gate on one of the busiest highways in northern Philippines, authorities say.
The bus driver, who has been detained, said he had fallen asleep at the wheel, police told AFP, adding that four children were among the dead.
Buses on the nearly 100km (62mi) Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway often ferry workers between Manila and surrounding provinces.  The accident on Thursday happened while families were travelling for labour day.
The Department of Transportation ordered the suspension of Solid North Bus, a major bus operator in the region and the company that owned the vehicle involved in the crash.
The bus driver may be charged with ""reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicides,"" police told AFP. The bus conductor has also been detained.
The accident also involved three sports utility vehicles and one container truck, the Philippine Red Cross said in a Facebook post.
The organisation said in another post on Wednesday that it was providing food and other aid to people in hospital who were injured by the crash.
Deadly bus accidents are not uncommon in the Philippines.
Drug use among bus drivers have also made headlines in recent weeks - though it is unclear if it was a factor in Thursday's accident.
In April, some public vehicle companies -  including buses, jeepneys and tricycles - faced suspension after 84 of its drivers tested positive for prohibited substances.
Transport Secretary Vince Dizon is set to meet representatives from nearly 30 bus companies on Friday after recent accident, local media reported.
""If the driver in this case was sleepy, we should ask how long he has been working. Maybe the bus company forced him to work long hours?"" he said in an interview with local broadcaster GMA Network. ""We need to look into everything and not just a patchwork of solutions.""
In 2023, 17 bus passengers died after the vehicle's brakes failed and it plunged into a ravine in central Philippines, along a winding road known among locals as the ""killer curve"".

The truck travelled for 30km (18 miles) before the scrap metal spillage was detected, authorities said. 
The incident forced city-bound lanes to close for hours on Friday, with the debris damaging the tyres of at least 300 cars.
Some emergency vehicles also had their tyres shredded, New South Wales Rural Fire Service said.
""A truck lost a load of scrap metal around 5am this morning, causing extensive debris,"" the fire service said.
New South Wales state police said the incident occurred on the M1 Pacific Motorway near Ourimbah, north of Sydney. The stretch of motorway reopened on Friday afternoon, after being closed for 10 hours.
NJ Ashton, the company that owns the truck, apologised and said it was helping with the clean-up. 
Authorities are using magnets to attract the metal. 
""It's not just a case of getting a road sweeper out or guys and girls with brooms. We are using some magnetic devices. We are removing embedded metal in the highway itself. This takes a long time,"" state highway patrol commander Howard Collins told a press conference.
The M1 is a freight and commuter route that runs north of Sydney. 
State roads minister Jenny Aitchison said the situation was ""unprecedented"".
""We are working with all of the resources of government and the private sector to do the clean-up,"" she said.
""It's like trying to hoover up the highway. It's very difficult.""
The truck driver, a 46-year-old man, was cooperating with inquiries, police said.  
""We're taking full responsibility for what's happened and are very sorry for any damage and disruption that's been caused,"" NJ Ashton said in a statement on its website.
""We still don't fully understand how this occurred.""
Mr Collins said the truck had travelled over 30 km (18.64 miles) with debris falling from the back of the vehicle before the spillage was detected."

A rural boatbuilder has come to the aid of two women who were forced to postpone their attempt to row from Peru to Australia after part of their boat broke.
Miriam Payne, 25, from East Yorkshire, and Jess Rowe, 28, from Hampshire, set off from Peru on 8 April to row 8,000 miles (12,875 km) across the Pacific.
Yet they had to return to Lima after rowing 350 miles (563km) when the rudder of their boat, Velocity, snapped in heavy storms. 
Southgates Boatyard, based in Horning on the Norfolk Broads, heard of the news and worked round the clock to make a replacement after its staff felt ""compelled to help"".
The rowers' attempt to cross the Pacific had to be abandoned when the rudder broke
The pair were attempting to be the first crew to row non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean when their boat's steering went awry and they spent nearly a week adrift.
They were eventually towed back to Lima to organise the boat repairs.
Specially crafted replacement rudders from Southgates Boatyard will now be flown out to the Peruvian capital to be fitted to the boat.
It is hoped the duo will be able to resume their fundraising challenge before 8 May in order to avoid the start of the Pacific's cyclone season.
Chris Bunn, Southgates Boatyard manager, said: ""When we heard about Jess and Miriam's situation, we felt compelled to help. 
""It's inspiring to support such an incredible challenge, especially when it's tied to deserving causes like the Outward Bound Trust. 
""Our entire team is proud to have played a small part in their historic attempt.""
Ms Payne and Ms Rowe were drifting at sea for about a week before they were towed back to Peru for their boat to be repaired
The Seas the Day team challenge was set up by Ms Payne and Ms Rowe to raise money for the Outward Bound Trust - a UK charity to teach children about adventuring and life skills. 
Ms Payne said they were ""so thankful"" to the boatbuilder for its help. 
""To design and produce specialist rudders in such a short time and arrange for them to be flown out to us in Lima is nothing short of amazing,"" she said. 
""Without their help, we wouldn't be able to continue our mission.""
The pair had been posting daily video diaries on social media, with their journey originally expected to take about six months.

Businesses are bracing for possible impact after neighbours India and Bangladesh  recently imposed tit-for-tat trade restrictions after months of verbal sparring.
Last month, Bangladesh restricted land imports of cotton yarn from India to shield local industries from cheaper imports. 
Dhaka's move came days after India abruptly stopped the transhipment facility it had offered Bangladesh to export its cargoes to third countries via its ports and airports, citing ""congestion"".
Relations between the countries have soured since former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August after massive protests. She is currently in exile in India and an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is in charge.
Since then Dhaka has demanded Hasina be extradited to face charges of crimes against humanity, money laundering and corruption. Hasina denies the accusations against her, and Delhi has not officially reacted to the demand.
India has also frequently criticised reports of attacks on the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh. It recently said the alleged killing of a Hindu community leader ""reflects a pattern of systematic persecution under the interim government"".
Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, denies targeting minorities, calling most incidents politically motivated or ordinary crimes. Hindus make up less than 10% of its 170 million population.
Bangladesh imposed restrictions on import of cotton from India via land 
As the countries spar, firms are counting the cost.
Yarn, vital for Bangladesh's clothing factories, can still enter by sea and air - but they are slower and costlier routes.
In 2024, India had exported $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) worth of cotton yarn to Bangladesh, a third of it via land ports.
The now-halted transhipment facility let Bangladeshi exporters send clothes made for high-end brands by road to Indian cities, from where it would be flown to Europe and the US.
""It's a blow [to Bangladesh's fast-fashion export industry],"" says Anis Ahmed, head of supply chain firm MGH Group, which ships for European fast-fashion brands. ""The India route got cargo to Western countries in a week. By sea, it takes up to eight weeks.""
Bangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter after China, shipped $38bn in clothing last year. Over $1bn of this moved via the India land-air route, which Ahmed says was thriving.
Limited air freight capacity and under-equipped airports hamper direct exports from Bangladesh.
Many see Delhi's withdrawal of the transhipment facility as a response to remarks by Yunus during a recent China visit.
He had called Bangladesh the ""only guardian of the ocean"" for India's landlocked north-east and suggested that the region could become an ""extension of the Chinese economy.""
Leaders from India's north-eastern states called the comments ""offensive"".
Yunus's remarks, spotlighting India's strategic vulnerability in the region to China, raised alarms in Delhi.
India's north-east is linked to the mainland by the 20km-wide Siliguri Corridor - dubbed the ""chicken's neck"" - flanked by Nepal and Bangladesh and close to Tibet's Chumbi Valley.
With a history of border tensions and having lost a war in 1962, Indian defence planners fear that China could target the corridor to cut off the north-eastern states from the rest of the country in any future conflict.
Bangladeshi analysts say Yunus's remarks were misinterpreted and aimed at promoting regional connectivity.
During his China visit, Dhaka also welcomed Beijing's interest in a $1bn Teesta River project in northern Bangladesh.
Indian analysts warn that Chinese involvement in the project, which is not far from the strategic Siliguri Corridor, could unsettle Delhi.
Bangladesh is the world's second largest exporter of ready-to-wear clothes
But there is concern on both sides over the frosty ties.
Resentment is growing in Bangladesh over tightened Indian visa rules, with approvals plunging since Hasina was driven from power. Previously, two million Bangladeshis visited India yearly for tourism, business, education and medical care. The number of visas issued daily has dropped by over 80% in the past few months according to local media.
Hasina's stay in India and the extradition demand remains a big irritant.
""They should realise that there is no way that we can just hand Hasina to them. We know what will happen to her if she's handed over. I think public opinion in India would not countenance that,"" says Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary.
Amid rising tensions, India's clothing manufacturers' association has called for a ban on Bangladeshi garment imports via land. Bangladeshi analysts warn that more trade barriers would be counter-productive.
""I think there is a strong view nowadays in Bangladesh that we should also reassess the other transit and transhipment facilities given to India [for its north-eastern states] by the earlier [Hasina] government,"" Debapriya Bhattacharya, a senior economist with the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Dhaka, tells the BBC.
India uses Bangladeshi ports, roads and waterways to transport goods to its landlocked north-east, cutting distance, time and costs. However, officials say transit volumes haven't reached expected levels.
Delhi-Dhaka tensions are rising amid growing ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Bangladesh, once East Pakistan, fought for independence in 1971 with Indian support. Hasina distanced herself from Pakistan during her 15-year rule.
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch visited Dhaka last month, the first such visit in 15 years. A planned visit by Pakistan Deputy PM Ishaq Dar was postponed due to tensions between Delhi and Islamabad over the deadly militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last week.
""I don't think there is any concern over Dhaka's reachout to Pakistan. If there is any suggestion that there is an intent to work together and make things difficult for India, then that will obviously cause concern,"" says Saran, the former Indian diplomat.
Sharp official reactions from both sides are also influencing public opinion in India and Bangladesh. There is a growing anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh, with Indian media accused of exaggerating the attacks on minorities and Islamist threats.
The people-to-people ties built over years seem to be on the retreat, and analysts point out that if both sides fail to stay calm, their actions could harm trade and economic relations.

Punjabi rap music plays over a video showing three men at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. One after the other, they smile at the camera before casually turning to talk and laugh together.
The three are clearly friends. Two of them, Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad, are cousins from rural Pakistan.
But it's the third man in particular who dominates the conversation. He's Fadi Gujjar, a people smuggler.
The video - posted to Gujjar's TikTok account - is one of more than 450 clips analysed by BBC Verify that reveal clues about his activities and his close relationship to the other men.
Within a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead - beaten to death on the boat journey sold to them by Gujjar, who promised a safe route into Europe.
Meanwhile, Gujjar found himself on the run, wanted by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), external for his role in the tragedy.
When BBC Verify contacted him on a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said repeatedly in a series of voice notes his name had been ""misused"" by survivors in connection with the disaster and that he was leaving it all in the hands of Allah.
BBC Verify contacts the people smuggler, Fadi Gujjar
Fadi Gujjar is from Jaurah in Pakistan's Punjab region. In his 30s, his real name is Khawar Hassan - though he also goes by Bishi Gujjar.
Pakistani smugglers the BBC has previously reported on have tended to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online.
But Gujjar is careful. His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified are local to Jaurah. Advertisements for his services seem to spread by word of mouth.
His current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul, Turkey - an oasis for smugglers looking to make a quick buck. Videos posted to TikTok place him in the city since July 2022, showing the smuggler outside the iconic Hagia Sophia and a Pakistani supermarket.
One other location stands out: Mauritania on West Africa's Atlantic coast - the nerve-centre of his operation and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey.
Since 2023, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) says Mauritania has become a hub for people smuggling - spurred on by a crackdown on other routes.
The route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people - including 14 children - have died or gone missing on it this year.
Migrant boats travel from Mauritania to the Canary Islands which are part of Spain and the European Union.
Many Pakistanis seeking economic opportunities in Europe are willing to take the risk. Life there is glorified online by migrants already living on the continent. Smugglers like Gujjar, whose lucrative business is fuelled by people's aspirations, take advantage of this.
These migrants are taking a gamble, using their families' savings or selling up to make the journey. The survivors we spoke to, on average, say they paid Gujjar $13,000 (Â£10,000).
There are no direct flights from Pakistan to Mauritania, so some of the migrants transited through Ethiopia or the Middle East. From there, almost all of them went on to Senegal, before crossing into Mauritania, either by road or a short boat journey along the Senegal River.
Gujjar's travel history - obtained by BBC Verify through a source - showed the smuggler followed a similar route, entering Dakar airport in Senegal on two occasions in 2024.
Multiple videos also place him in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott from October 2024 - though the date of upload could differ to when they were filmed.
Further clips, posted to TikTok by Ali and Shahzad place Gujjar in Mauritania as early as August 2024. The trio are seen on the rooftops of Nouakchott's sand-coloured buildings and in restaurants around the city - a luxury other migrants couldn't afford.
Fadi Gujjar (R), Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad were close, with images on social media showing them together in Mauritania
Videos from their accounts reveal the men were close, hailing from the same village. Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed to BBC Verify that his nephew Sufian Ali was friends with Gujjar.
One survivor named Uzair Bhat said Gujjar falsely promised him safe and legal routes to Europe. He sent BBC Verify proof of funds transferred to a bank account under Gujjar's real name, Khawar Hassan.
But when Uzair arrived in Mauritania, the smuggler backtracked.
""He said going by air will not work from here. I'll send you by a big ship,"" Uzair recalled. ""Please cooperate, your visa [to Europe] won't come through."" 
Eventually Uzair relented.
Listen: From a smuggler's TikTok to tragedy
As well as Ali, Shahzad and Uzair, BBC Verify identified two other migrants who bought journeys from Gujjar.
Once they arrived in Nouakchott they say they were placed in ""safe houses"" - a term used for buildings tucked away in obscure alleys where migrants are held illegally by smugglers.
One person who used a different agent said he also stayed in safe houses run by Gujjar.
BBC Verify confirmed the location of one to an area near the port of Nouakchott, which survivors say Gujjar occasionally visited.
Survivors BBC Verify spoke to say they set off from Nouakchott in a small fishing boat in the early hours on 2 January. Most of those onboard bought passage from smugglers in their hometowns in Pakistan.
But the three day trip turned into a deadly two-week journey adrift at sea. 
Uzair said that from the day they left port the migrants ""were constantly scooping water out of the boat"". Another man, Bilalwal Iqbal, recalled that passengers soon began ""drinking sea water and after drinking it, people became delirious"".
According to the survivors, the crew onboard - West Africans employed by the smugglers - starved the Pakistani migrants of food and water, and beat them daily.
""I tried to take one of their bottles of water so they hit me on the head with a rope and the impact just made me fall back,"" Iqbal told BBC Verify. ""Then they pummelled my thumbs with a hammer. I still have those wounds.""
Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad died after being beaten to death by the crew, their uncle said. He was informed of the circumstances surrounding their deaths by survivors.
Others died of starvation, dehydration and hypothermia.
Those still alive, including the crew, had given up until they saw a much larger fishing vessel come into view. Uzair Bhat jumped into the ocean and swam towards it for help.
The coastguard instructed the vessel to take the migrant boat to Dakhla port - 60 miles away. According to the IOM, 15 dead bodies were found onboard while 35 people remain missing at sea and presumed dead.
Pakistani authorities have named Gujjar as one of ten smugglers involved in the tragedy. Some have been arrested, but not Gujjar.
BBC Verify geolocated his most recent TikTok posts to Baku, Azerbaijan - though we cannot say for certain if he is still there.
Since news of the rescue broke, his mother and one of his brothers have been detained in Pakistan, accused of collecting money on Gujjar's behalf from people buying routes to Europe.
BBC Verify has also seen six police reports filed in Punjab by the families of those on the boat journey. They allege Gujjar collected $75,000 (Â£56,000) for his role in the January disaster. Three people paid in full, while the remaining three had only paid deposits, the police reports said.
We believe Gujjar was still facilitating journeys to Europe after the boat disaster in January.
Contacted by an undercover BBC reporter in March using a phone number obtained from survivors, Gujjar said he ""knew someone"" who would help arrange a journey, but did not directly offer to get involved himself.

Listen to Katy read this article
In Western Sydney, an audience of Stetson-wearing Australians are sitting in their fold-up camping chairs, swigging beers and eating a spiralled fried potato on a skewer known as a 'chip on a stick'.
People here are enjoying bull rides, barrel racing and bucking broncos. It feels like a slice of Americana in New South Wales perhaps - but that would miss the point that here, rodeo has become very much an outback Australian tradition in its own right.
In recent months, politics here in Australia could be compared to watching a rodeo. Between conflict in Europe, the Middle East and more recently US President Donald Trump and his threat of global trade wars, every day has brought with it a sharp jolt that changes the dynamics of the campaign trail. Politicians, like these cowboys, have been thrown off course despite their best efforts.
In Western Sydney, rodeo has become a tradition of its own 
""Tariffs are great,"" exclaims rodeo fan Guy Algozzino, who's dressed in a cowboy hat, a waistcoat and a Western-style bolo tie with an engraved image of a cowboy riding a bull. ""We should have had tariff protection many years ago - it looks bad now [but] America's fantastic â¦ Trump's the best thing America ever had.''
Other spectators are more nuanced.
""It's going nuts,"" admits Jared Harris, when asked about world politics. ""I'm just sitting back and watching. It's a bit like a show. It's quite interesting to watch, it's entertaining. It probably affects me more than I realise, but I just choose to ignore it.""
Guy Algozzino said he thought tariffs were great and that tariff protection should have been introduced years ago
Australia didn't worry too much about President Trump's second coming when he won power back in November. The country had already witnessed a Trump presidency â and weathered it. Australia felt far removed from the shores of America.
But Trump's second term is panning out very differently. Tariffs - imposed on ally and adversary alike - have travelled the whole world. 
Trump doesn't care about making enemies. But Australia does. People here pride themselves on 'mateship' â a value that embodies friendship and loyalty â and that extends to politics too.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said as much when Trump initially announced tariffs without exemptions. This was not ""the act of a friend,"" said Albanese, while he also committed to not responding in kind.
Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese criticised Trump's tariffs as ""not the act of a friend"" but said Australia wouldn't retaliate
All of this comes as the country heads to a federal election on 3 May. Candidates would rather focus on domestic issues they can control: cost-of-living, housing and healthcare. Instead, they are forced to grapple with a question that goes right to the heart of Australia's role in the world: how to deal with a US president as unpredictable as Trump?
In the final few days of campaigning before up to 18 million Australians go to the polls, the Labor Party's Albanese, who entered power three years ago after promising to invest in social services and tackle climate change, went on a speedy tour of six states. That effort appears to be paying off, with the latest YouGov poll putting Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party vote, versus 47 per cent for the opposition Coalition (an alliance of the Liberals and Nationals). This is a modest turnaround from the beginning of the year, when Labor was consistently lagging the Coalition in polls.
""It's not the campaign either party thought they would be having,"" says Amy Remeikis, chief political analyst at the Australia Institute think tank. ""The looming figure of Trump is overshadowing the domestic campaign but also forcing Australia's leaders to do something they haven't had to do in a long time - examine Australia's links to the US.""
Australia depends on close defence ties like Aukus and Five Eyes, alliances that link it closely with the UK and US
The US-Australia relationship has perhaps been taken for granted in these parts. Australia likes the fact the US has long been a dominant military force in the Pacific. Australia relies on its funding and benefits from being part of alliances like Aukus - the far-reaching defence pact between Australia, the UK and the US, designed to counter China â and the Anglo-intelligence alliance Five Eyes.
The rise of China has made Australia even more conscious about having the US on its side. Beijing has expanded its military presence in the Pacific, launching various military exercises in recent years - including one live-fire drill in February that saw Chinese naval vessels just 340 nautical miles from the New South Wales coast. Australia recently announced efforts to expand its navy and now hosts four US military bases - decisions fuelled in part by the rise of China.
It's all placed extra value on Canberra's alliance with Washington DC - one that Trump may be throwing into doubt.
Back in February, Trump held a meeting with the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. He was asked whether they would be discussing Aukus.
""What does that mean?"" Trump asked the reporter. After being given an explanation of Aukus, he continued. ""We'll be discussing that â¦ we've had a very good relationship with Australia.""
When asked about Aukus during a meeting with Sir Keir Starmer, Trump appeared unfamiliar with the pact, asking: ""What does that mean?""
Australia collectively held its breath, then let it out in a big sigh of relief.
A blip maybe - but an indication perhaps of how little Trump thinks about Australia right now. However, Australia, like much of the world, is thinking about the US.
""We don't have anywhere else to turn,"" says David Andrews, senior policy advisor at the National Security College, which is part of the Australian National University in Canberra. ""We are physically isolated from everyone. As long as we've had European settlement here, we've always been concerned about the distance [and] isolation, which is why we've always maintained such a strong relationship with first Britain and then the US as the dominant maritime power.""
While only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US (China is by far Australia's biggest trading partner), the US still dominates the conversation here.
Only 5% of Australia's exports go to the US, but Trump's influence still looms large in Australian politics
""This isn't a time to end alliances,"" says Justin Bassi, director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. ""That would be cutting off our nose to spite our face.""
And, perhaps counter to the majority view here, Bassi thinks that Australia should support Trump's moves.
""We should continue to make it clear that any measures the US takes against Australia are unjustified but we should welcome and support American measures to counter Beijing's malign actions - or for that matter Russia,"" he says. ""Not to keep Trump happy but because it is in Australia's interests to constrain the adversary that is undermining our strategic interests.""
A poll published by the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper last month found that 60% of Australians felt Trump's victory was bad for Australia. That was up from last November when it was just 40%.
And a Lowy Institute poll published two weeks later showed almost two in three Australians held 'not very much' or no trust 'at all' in the US to act responsibly.
Big questions on transnational alliances are not part of normal campaigning. But when Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton faced each other in their first televised debate, the first question asked by the audience was one on Trump.
Dutton has long stressed that he would be the politician best suited to dealing with the US President. He often cites his experience as a cabinet minister during tariff negotiations in Trump's first term. But that strategy doesn't always serve him well.
The first question from the audience in a recent leaders' debate between Anthony Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton was about Donald Trump
""He went into the election telling people he and Trump were similar enough that they would get on better, that he was the sort of personality Trump liked,"" says Remeikis. ""He's not repeating that now because people don't want someone to get on with Trump - they want someone who will stand up to him.""
Dutton has had to do some back-pedalling on comments he made earlier in the year. Back in February, after Trump said he had plans to eject Palestinians from Gaza, Dutton called the US president ""a deal-maker â¦ a big thinker.""
And he has come in for some criticism amid accusations of copying the US president. He's talked about cutting public sector jobs, for example. And his Liberal party appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as shadow minister for government efficiency, not too dissimilar to the Doge. But when Senator Price recently started talking about wanting to 'Make Australia Great Again' on the campaign trail, Dutton avoided questions over the comments.
Albanese of course has to tread a careful line too. In a world that's being turned upside down, he's trying to reassure people he's a safe pair of hands; that those alliances remain.
That may turn out to be in his favour.
Some analysts say Donald Trump's actions could actually be helping Prime Minister Albanese, as voters rally around him during what feels like a crisis
Indeed, some analysts say that Trump's conduct may be helping Albanese, with voters rushing to support the incumbent during a time of perceived crisis. Just a few months ago, Labor's re-election was thought unlikely as it consistently polled behind the Coalition. But the final YouGov polling model of the election, published a few days ago, predicted that Labor will win 84 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives - an increased majority.
For Professor Gordon Flake, CEO at Perth USAsia Centre, a think tank, it paints a stark parallel with this week's election result in Canada - in which the Liberal Party won re-election by riding a backlash of anti-Trump sentiment.
""What we have seen in Canada has been a dramatic shift back towards the incumbent government and that is a rallying around the flag based on attacks on that country,"" he says. 
""The attacks on Australia haven't been as severe so it's not the same degree, but at the same time you're also seeing a rallying around the current Labor government. Six months ago you thought their re-election would be unlikely; today on the cusp of the election here in Australia, it seems more likely than not - and one of the important factors in that has been developments in Washington DC. ""
Professor Gordon Flake said that six months ago, Albanese's re-election seemed unlikely, but now it appears more likely than not
But whoever wins, they will have a big job on their hands to navigate Australia's future with its allies.
""We have to make do with the hand we've been dealt,"" says Andrews. ""I expect that we are going to have to be much more ruthlessly self-interested and that's not comfortable because our foreign policy has generally been based around cooperation, collaboration and multilateralism â so that shared sense of threat that middle powers have of working together to maximise their output.""
Back at the rodeo, the sun's gone down, the cheerleaders are out and the audience gets ready to watch bucking broncos â the riders shortly afterwards holding on to their steer for as long as possible before being violently thrown to the ground. 
Flying above the arena are the flags of Canada and the US, alongside Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. There may not be much of a team spirit among allies right now - but voters here will be keen to see how their next leader rides out the storm.

Karen Carter, 65, was found lying near her car with stab wounds by her friend, in the village of TrÃ©molat in the Dordogne region on Tuesday evening, the state prosecutor said.
Mrs Carter's husband, Alan, who is in South Africa, said she was ""such a decent, lovely person"", and spoke of the family's shock.
A 69-year-old local woman was arrested on Thursday as part of an investigation into the mother-of-four's death. In an update on Friday, prosecutors said she had been released.
The friend who discovered Mrs Carter's body was questioned by police and later released without charge, the state prosecutor, Sylvie Martins-Guedes, said.
""At this stage, no hypothesis is being favoured,"" she added.
Mrs Carter had lived in TrÃ©molat for more than a decade, where she ran two holiday rental homes.
""Particularly since Covid, my wife has spent more time there running the gÃ®tes [holiday homes]. It's been very busy, it's been very successful,"" Mr Carter said.
""She was very good at her job and marketing it and getting bookings throughout the year.""
Mr Carter said his cousin, who lives in TrÃ©molat, called him after seeing a post about Mrs Carter's death on a local community Facebook page.
""She phoned me... to say she's sorry to tell me and that she thinks Karen has died. That was the first I heard about it,"" he said.
""No one had got in touch with me at all to let me know what had happened. I found out through my cousin who happened to see it on a Facebook page.""

He said he received confirmation of Mrs Carter's death after his assistant phoned local police.
""She managed to get through to the right person. I don't know how she managed that, but she did.
""He confirmed it, but he didn't give any details of what happened,"" Mr Carter said, adding that he has relied on news reports for information.
Mr Carter said the village was in shock over her death. ""It's terrible. Such a small village where nothing like this ever happens.""
He described Mrs Carter as an outgoing, friendly person who ""wouldn't hurt a fly"", and said her death has been ""traumatic"" for his family.
""I'm an introvert, and she's the exact opposite. She's an extrovert, she loves people, she loves to have fun. People love her, she has a good heart,"" he said.
""She's the one who would bring home the lost dog, or cat, or whatever. She's that sort of person. Everyone liked her. That's why I married her. She's just lovely."""

More than 1,000 pigeons from across the West of England are being prepared to play their part in the VE Day celebrations.
The Paulton Homing Society in Somerset is among many groups across the UK racing pigeons across the English Channel on Saturday 3 May.
During World War Two pigeons played a vital role in delivering messages when radio communications were disrupted. Many were awarded the Dickin Medal for bravery.
""These little things saved many soldiers' lives during the war,"" said Geoff Cooper, a member of the Paulton Homing Society.
Geoff Cooper said pigeons were remarkable
""They were let go, they used to get shot, they came back with legs blown off - but they still delivered their messages.
""People don't realise what they do. They see a pigeon in the street and think it's a pest. But they'll fly 500 miles in 12 hours. They're remarkable.""
This year, three special pigeon races from France will commemorate VE Day.
On Saturday, the birds will travel by ferry from Portsmouth to Normandy before flying 183 miles (294 km) from the town of Vire back to their fanciers' homes in Somerset.
""It's always something special,"" said Mr Cooper. ""To see them dropping in one after another is lovely.""
""I think pigeons are overlooked,"" said Catherine Cooper
Catherine Cooper, also a member of the society, said the sport was ""gradually dying"" - and that events like these were vital to keeping it alive.
""I think pigeons are often overlooked for the part they played in the war,"" she said.
""People see them in towns and cities and think 'flying rats, disease-ridden' - which is totally wrong.""
The pigeons are due to fly from the town of Vier in France back to Somerset
During wartime, racing pigeons were transported by U-boats or alongside agents parachuting into enemy territory.
""In the days of modern communication, it's easy to forget, but at one time, pigeons were modern communications,"" said Mrs Cooper.
""Some of the fanciers here were 10 years old when it was VE Day, and they're still racing their pigeons.
""We've got people in the club whose grandparents served in the pigeon service.
""This may be one of the last times there will be a memorial where veterans from that era are still alive.""

777,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cze1zpnl1eeo,2025-05-01 16:53:29,"Next round of Iran-US nuclear talks postponed,","US President Donald Trump wrote to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in March, offering to begin nuclear talks 
A fourth round of Iran-US talks over Tehran's nuclear programme has been postponed.
Iran said the two countries, along with facilitators Oman, had jointly decided to postpone Saturday's meeting in Rome for ""logistical and technical reasons"". The US said the timing of the talks had not been confirmed in the first place.
It came as US President Donald Trump threatened action against those buying Iranian oil or petrochemicals on Thursday, after Washington introduced fresh sanctions this week on companies it said had links to Tehran.
Trump pulled the US out of a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and five other world powers in 2018, and has long said he would make a ""better"" deal.
He has previously warned of military action if these new talks, which began in April, do not succeed. Both sides described the first round of talks in Oman's capital Muscat as ""constructive"".
Iran's Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi said that Tehran's ""determination to secure a negotiated solution"" had not changed.
He wrote on X: ""In fact, we are more determined than ever to achieve a just and balanced deal: guaranteeing an end to sanctions, and creating confidence that Iran's nuclear program will forever remain peaceful while ensuring that Iranian rights are fully respected.""
However, a US State Department spokesperson said Saturday's meeting had not been confirmed and that it expected the next round to take place ""in the near future"".
Oman's foreign minister said a new date would be set when agreed by all sides.
The announcement is unlikely to mean that the talks have broken down, with both sides eager to avoid war.
But reports from Tehran have described growing doubt about the usefulness of the talks, pointing to the new sanctions and what Tehran calls contradictory positions from the US delegation.
Part of Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy toward Tehran, the sanctions announced on Wednesday target entities said by the US to be involved in the illicit trade of Iranian petroleum and petrochemicals.
The US State Department said in a statement, external: ""The Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict in the Middle East, advance its nuclear program, and support its terrorist partners and proxies.
""Today, the United States is taking action to stem the flow of revenue that the regime uses to fund these destabilizing activities.""
Posting on his Truth Social account on Thursday, Trump wrote: ""Any country or person who buys any amount of oil or petrochemicals from Iran will be subject to, immediately, secondary sanctions.
""They will not be allowed to do business with the United States of America in any way, shape, or form.""
Iran has described the latest sanctions as ""further proof of the American decision-makers' contradictory behaviour and lack of good faith"".
Media reports in Iran also point to a post, external by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth on Thursday, which warned that Iran would ""pay the consequence"" for its support of Yemen's Houthi rebels. 
The message was reposted by Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff who has been leading the US delegation.
It read: ""Message to Iran: We see your lethal support to the Houthis. We know exactly what you are doing. You will pay the consequence at the time and place of our choosing.""
The Houthis have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups against Israel, the US and the wider West - along with armed groups such as Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement.
The US has launched several deadly strikes on Houthi targets in recent months in response to the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which began in November 2023 in response to Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
Trump has said that he is looking for a solution that would close Iran's pathways to build a nuclear bomb. But there are those in his administration who are pushing for the complete dismantlement of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme.
They are also pushing for Iran to stop support for its proxies in the region, including the Houthis.
Iran says its programme is peaceful and that it has a right to enrichment. It is hoping for a deal to limit, but not dismantle, its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
After Russia, Iran has been under the most extensive set of sanctions in history â the sanctions that the US has imposed on the country. 
President Massoud Pezeshkian has centred Iran's economic policies on the promise of the lifting these sanctions."

Public transport was shut down to stop people reaching Taksim Square, where demonstrations have been banned since 2013.
Footage showed clashes between riot police and protesters with demonstrators chanting as police forcefully move detainees onto buses.
The city saw huge protests in March after the arrest of the opposition mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - the main rival to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
On 1 May each year, marches led by workers and unions are held as part of International Labour Day celebrations in many countries.
Taksim Square  â the heart of Istanbul â   was under a tight lock down, with police and metal barriers along all roads leading to the area. 
Authorities were determined, perhaps this year more than ever, to ensure there were no major protests on the square, and they had enough riot police to ensure that.
The square, normally busy with bustling crowds, looked lifeless, with restaurants and shops sealed shut. 
The only way past the lines of police was with permission. Several labour unions were allowed briefly onto Taksim, carrying red banners and flowers.  
Standing in front of the Republic Monument, which commemorates the founding of the modern Turkey in 1923, one speaker complained about the restrictions they faced. Trucks with water canon parked a short distance away.
On roads leading to the square, groups of tourists passed by on foot from time to time, dragging suitcases, unsure of where they could go and unable to reach taxis.
The square was sealed off for several days before 1 May, according to AFP news agency.
A student named Murat said streets had been ""blocked... as if it's a state of emergency"", he told AFP.
""We weren't allowed into the squares... We were taken from the streets in small groups under torture. It's not a situation we're facing for the first time. It probably won't be the last.""
On Wednesday, 100 people were detained for allegedly planning to protest in the square.
The city's authorities said on Thursday that 382 people had been arrested for ""non-authorised demonstrations"".
Rights group Amnesty International has urged Turkey to lift the ban on demonstrations in Taksim.
The restrictions ""are based on entirely spurious security and public order grounds"", said Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty's specialist on Europe. 
In a statement, the group called on officials to respect the right to protest and ""not use force against peaceful protesters"".
Ekrem Imamoglu's arrest in March triggered mass protests on the streets of Istanbul as hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators came out in support of Istanbul's mayor, who is being held in jail on corruption charges he denies.
He has said his arrest is political, but the has government denied this and insists the Turkish courts are fully independent.
Mayor since 2019, Imamoglu is widely viewed as the only politician capable of challenging Erdogan in the 2028 election. Imamoglu was confirmed as the opposition party's candidate while he was in custody.
Erdogan has been in power for more than 20 years, first as prime minister then as president from 2014. He cannot run again for the presidency after 2028 - unless he changes Turkey's constitution."
779,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgm8r1eekd4o,2025-05-01 18:21:05,"US judge blocks use of Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans,","A Trump-appointed federal judge has ruled that the US president cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. 
US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez said Donald Trump's use of the wartime power was ""unlawful"" and had been improperly invoked. 
The law was written in 1798 to allow the removal of non-citizens in times of war or invasion. It has been used by Trump to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador on the basis they were members of the Tren de Aragua gang and ""conducting irregular warfare"".
The judge said the act only applied when the US was facing an ""armed organised attack"", which it is not. The administration has not commented.
President Trump in March issued a proclamation claiming that Tren de Aragua was invading the US, and justified the use of special powers to deport immigrants identified as gang members without court proceedings.
He used the act to deport two plane loads of alleged migrant gang members to the El Salvadoran terrorism prison known as Cecot. 
Neither the US government nor El Salvador has provided details of the deportees' alleged criminality or gang membership.
The ruling is the first time a federal judge has ruled the use of the act is ""unlawful"". 
""The historical record renders clear that the president's invocation of the AEA... is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute's terms,"" the judge wrote. 
""As a result, the court concludes that as a matter of law, the executive branch cannot rely on the AEA... to detain the named petitioners... or to remove them from the country.""
The judge pushed back against the Trump administration's argument that the president's use of the act was beyond the purview of the courts.
""Allowing the president to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the executive branch's authority under the AEA,"" he said
He added that allowing such a move would ""strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes"".  
The Alien Enemies Act has only been used three times before in US history - during World War Two, World War One and the War of 1812."

Deadly clashes between Islamist armed factions, security forces and fighters from the Druze religious minority near Damascus are another sign of the continuing fragility of the security situation in Syria after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.
Outside players have once again been involved, with Israel saying it carried out air strikes to protect Druze civilians.
It marks another fault-line in Syria, which has been left fractured and divided in the wake of 13 years of devastating civil war and decades of authoritarian rule by the Assad dynasty.
The new Syrian authorities have said they are determined to bring unity and stability, but many inside and outside the country still point to their roots in jihadism and remain suspicious of their agenda.
Before President Assad was toppled, his rule had been re-established in the main cities in Syria and along the highways between them - as well as the coastal heartland of the Alawite sect to which his family belongs.
But there were other regions partially or almost completely out of his control.
They included Idlib in the north, from where Syria's current leader Ahmed al-Sharaa led his Islamist rebel faction Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - a former al-Qaeda affiliate - to victory last December.
In the north-east, Syrian Kurdish forces maintained semi-autonomy throughout the civil war and beyond.
And south of Damascus, the Druze have also had some limited autonomy.
Those divisions remain, although the Alawite areas are now the most serious flashpoints for Syria's new rulers.
In March, days of fighting between security forces and fighters still loyal to Assad left hundreds of people dead, including civilians. Other armed factions loosely affiliated to the new authorities also became involved and carried out revenge killings against local Alawites.
Such violence is the biggest fear both for those who support Sharaa and those who are against him.
Syrian authorities said security forces were sent to Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to combat ""outlaw groups"" who had launched attacks from there
The latest clashes to the south of Damascus again involved fighters from several of the armed factions still active in Syria and the Druze. Their religion is an offshoot of Islam, with sizeable communities not only in Syria, but in Lebanon, Jordan and Israel too.
It is the connection with Israel that prompted the country's air force to carry out several strikes during fighting in and around the town of Ashrafiyat Sahnaya on Wednesday.
The Israeli government said the operation was a warning and demanded that the Syrian authorities prevent harm to the Druze.
Syrian authorities said security forces were deployed to Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to restore security and stability, accusing what it called ""outlaw groups"" based there of instigating the clashes.
But the spiritual leader of Syria's Druze community, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, condemned the violence as an ""unjustifiable genocidal campaign"" and said people had been defending their homes from attacks by extremists.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 101 people have been killed this week in Ashrafiyat Sahnaya, the mainly Druze suburb of Jaramana, and the southern province of Suweida, which has a Druze majority.
The UK-based monitoring group said that included 71 members of the Druze community, including 10 civilians and 35 gunmen who were shot dead in an ""ambush"" while travelling from Suweida to Damascus on Wednesday, as well as 30 members of the security forces and allied armed groups.
A monitoring group says 61 Druze gunmen and 10 civilians have been killed in the fighting on the outskirts of Damascus and in Suweida province
For now at least, the violence has abated, with the government said to have agreed ceasefires with local Druze leaders.
But the suddenness and ferocity with which the clashes erupted - prompted it seems by an audio recording circulating on social media of a man insulting the Prophet Muhammad, falsely attributed to a Druze cleric - shows the potential for Syria to slide back into conflict.
There is mutual suspicion between the new Islamist-led authorities and religious minorities like the Alawites and the Druze.
It is a combustible mixture, which is only further inflamed by the role that outside countries like Israel and Turkey continue to play. Both have advanced their interests inside Syria since the fall of Assad.
Israel has seized more land in the south of Syria beyond the area of the Golan Heights that it has long occupied.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for the full demilitarisation of Suweida and two other provinces south of Damascus. He says the new Syrian government is extremist and that the presence of its security forces anywhere near the border would represent a threat to Israel.
Israel has played up its connection with the Druze community in the region, presenting itself as their defender, even if many Syrian Druze themselves do not see it that way.
The new authorities in Damascus have rejected Israel's moves as an infringement of Syria's sovereignty, although they have been keen to make clear that they are not seeking conflict with Israel.
Israel has seized territory in southern Syria and carried out hundreds of air strikes since rebel forces ousted Bashar al-Assad
Turkey was the key sponsor of the rebel forces that finally ousted Assad and it has established close ties with the country's new leadership. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has denounced Israel's latest military intervention in Syria as a ""dangerous and unacceptable provocation"".
Tension between Turkey and Israel over their differing aims in the new Syria add another complication to the host of problems facing Sharaa and his government.
With so many forces both inside and outside Syria still dangerously at odds with one another, the goal of unifying and stabilising the country - despite some successes so far - remains hugely challenging.
Syria will need plenty of breathing space as well as financial and political support from the international community to make real progress towards a better future for its citizens, impoverished and uprooted by years of bitter conflict."

A woman from the UK has become the oldest person in the world, at the age of 115 and 252 days.
Ethel Caterham, who lives at a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, reached the milestone following the death of Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canabarro Lucas, aged 116 on Wednesday.
Ms Caterham was born on 21 August 1909 and is the last surviving subject of Edward VII.
Celebrating her 115th birthday in August 2024, she said she ""didn't know why there was all the fuss"".
She said the secret to her longevity was ""never arguing with anyone, I listen and I do what I like"".
The new record has been confirmed by Guinness World Records and LongeviQuest, a database of the world's oldest people.
On her 115th birthday, Ms Caterham received a letter from the King congratulating her on a ""truly remarkable milestone"".
The King conveyed his ""warmest good wishes"" and ""hoped that Ethel enjoys her incredibly special day"".
The letter stated that His Majesty was ""heartened to learn about Ethel's fascinating personal history"".
Ms Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, in Hampshire, and was raised in nearby Tidworth in Wiltshire.
She was the second youngest of eight children.

At the age of 18, she was employed as an au pair to a military family in India.
She returned to the UK in 1931 and met her future husband, Norman Caterham. They married at Salisbury Cathedral in 1933.
Mr Caterham became a lieutenant colonel in the army, and the couple were stationed in Hong Kong and Gibraltar.
In Hong Kong, Ms Caterham set up a nursery.
She has lived through the sinking of the Titanic, World War One, the Russian Revolution, the Great Depression and World War Two.
She has spent the last 50 years living in Surrey and continued driving until she was 97.
One of her sisters, Gladys, lived to be 104.
She has three granddaughters and five great grandchildren.
Ms Caterham celebrated turning 115 with family and friends 
A spokesperson for Hallmark Lakeview Luxury Care Home, where Ms Caterham is a resident, said: ""What an incredible milestone and a true testament to a life well-lived.
""Your strength, spirit and wisdom are an inspiration to us all. Here's to celebrating your remarkable journey.""
Ms Caterham is also one of the oldest people to survive Covid-19, after contracting it in 2020 at the age of 110, according to Guinness World Records.
Mark McKinley, director of records at Guinness World Records, told the BBC:  ""Ethel never set out to be a record breaker. 
""But we're hoping to meet her some time soon and present her with her certificate.""

A jury has been shown footage of an alleged killer attacking a man in a ""frenzied stabbing"" while having sex with him in west London. 
Yostin Mosquera, 35, is accused of murdering both Albert Alfonso, 62, and Paul Longworth, 71, before dismembering and decapitating them, packing body parts into suitcases and taking them to Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol last July.
The Old Bailey heard that Mr Alfonso paid Mr Mosquera for ""extreme sex"" which, with their knowledge, was often filmed and posted online.
Mr Longworth, Mr Alfonso's partner, was aware of the activities but was not involved, the jury was told.
This article contains material that some people may find distressing.
Mr Mosquera, a Colombian national, previously admitted the manslaughter of Mr Alfonso in a ""loss of control"" and blamed Mr Longworth's death on Mr Alfonso.
This was rejected by the prosecution and Mr Mosquera is charged with two counts of murder.
The footage of the attack, along with its soundtrack which captured the sound of someone appearing to struggle to breathe, was watched in silence by the jury at the Old Bailey.
It was recorded on four cameras set up in the bedroom at the Shepherd's Bush flat to record sex sessions with Mr Alfonso and Mr Mosquera, who is then seen singing and dancing in the aftermath of the attack.
A court drawing of Yostin Mosquera and an interpreter at the Old Bailey
Mr Justice Bennathan had previously warned the jury the footage was ""not an easy watch"" and the soundtrack would potentially heighten any distress.
The men, both naked, are seen grappling with each other and wrestling to the ground, with Mr Alfonso bleeding from a knife wound to the neck.
Mr Alfonso eventually stopped struggling and his breathing could no longer be heard.
Mr Mosquera is then seen singing a song in Spanish and dancing, before sitting down to look at a computer.
The prosecution said Mr Mosquera had already killed Mr Longworth by hitting him on the back of the head with a hammer and had hidden his body in under-bed storage.
After the couple were dead, it is alleged Mr Mosquera tried to steal from them using information gleaned about their bank accounts. 
He made several cash withdrawals from Mr Alfonso's, obtaining at least Â£900 before the transactions started getting declined, the court was told.
Mr Mosquera took a suitcase and a trunk to Clifton Suspension Bridge
Mr Mosquera was stopped just before midnight by a concerned cyclist as he stood on the Clifton Suspension Bridge two days later with a large suitcase and a trunk, the court heard.
He claimed he was using it to move heavy car parts but dumped the luggage and fled when the cyclist and bridge staff noticed fluid leaking from them, jurors were told.
The police were called and officers discovered the cases contained body parts.
A luggage label on the trunk led police to the couple's address in Shepherd's Bush where they found other body parts of Mr Alfonso and Mr Longworth in a chest freezer, the court heard.
The trial continues.

Police in South Africa are searching for answers after the bodies of three police officers - who had been missing for six days - were found in a river.
Boipelo Senoge, 20, Cebekhulu Linda, 24, and Keamogetswe Buys, 30, were last seen leaving a petrol station near Johannesburg last Wednesday.
Their bodies were discovered by divers around 70km (43 miles) away in Hennops River earlier this week. The car they had been in was recovered from the same river on Thursday.
The police initially said they were investigating a ""possible hijacking"", but speaking on Thursday, the police chief told journalists: ""At this stage it looks like an accident,"" though a forensic investigation needed to be concluded.
The three police officers - all constables - were travelling in a white VW Polo when they went missing, a police statement said.
Their vehicle tracking device and mobile phones have been off since then.
A search team subsequently ""spent sleepless nights combing the length and breadth"" of the Gauteng, Free State and Limpopo provinces, eventually finding parts of a vehicle ""believed to be"" a VW Polo, said national police commissioner Fannie Masemola.
A Renault Kangoo van was then found nearby on the banks of Hennops River, in the area of Centurion. Two other bodies were also found.
The VW Polo was pulled out of the river on Thursday.
The three officers were travelling from Free State to Limpopo, when they went missing.
Along with the three constables, the divers found the remains of a police employee, who has not been named. He had been driving the Renault van, said Gen Masemola.
He added that the fifth body was decomposed and had not yet been identified.
It is not clear if these discoveries are connected to the deaths of the police officers.

Keamogetswe Buys (left) and Cebekhulu Linda (right) were last seen a week ago in a white VW Polo
The search for the missing police officers was followed closely by the South African public and prayers for the three constables had been circulating across social media.
After the bodies were found, devastated loved ones gathered along the banks of the Hennops River, holding candles.
Speaking near where the vehicle was recovered on Thursday, Gen Masemola said: ""We need to give the investigation a space. At the end of the day we can't rule out anything, but we can't conclusively say this is what happened... At this stage it looks like an accident until we finalise the forensics.""
This marks a significant change in tone from Sunday, when the commissioner said: ""We cannot have criminals undermine the authority of the state by kidnapping three police officers. This is just a stern warning to those behind this incident, either you hand yourselves over, or we will fetch you ourselves.""

784,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yg456mzn8o,2025-05-01 09:23:30,"Seven takeaways from US-Ukraine resources deal,","The US and Ukraine have signed a deal that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn country's natural resources.
Months in the making, it sets up an investment fund that Ukraine hopes will cement US assistance as the country struggles to repel Russia three years after the invasion.
The Ukrainians have now published the deal, external and there have been public statements from both sides. Here are seven key takeaways.
Trump has previously demanded that Ukraine pay back the $350bn (Â£264bn) of aid that he claims has been provided by the US during the war - a condition that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected.
But Washington appears to have made a concession. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the agreement did not dictate that his country pay back any supposed ""debt"".

Follow reaction to deal as it happens
What minerals does Ukraine have?

Trump has styled the agreement as a win for his side as well, saying his country will get back ""much more in theory"" than the billions that were provided to Ukraine by his predecessor Joe Biden.

The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia than is usually the case from the Trump administration.
The agreement refers to ""Russia's full-scale invasion"" and the US Treasury Department adds that ""no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine"".
This will hearten Kyiv, which has demanded more pressure be placed on Russia in talks between Moscow and Washington discussing a possible ceasefire.
Despite the fact that much of the talk around the deal relates to Ukraine's mineral wealth, the agreement also includes provisions for oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons.
In all cases, the resources stay in Ukrainian ownership, even though the US will get joint access.
The inclusion of oil and gas has been seen as a softening of the Ukrainian position, since they were not in earlier drafts of the deal.
Senior administration officials told reporters they believe that ""more value"" can be derived from these resources if the fighting ends quickly. 
Ukraine has long aspired to join the European Union and accession talks formally began last June.
There were some concerns in Kyiv that the resources deal could hinder Ukraine's ability to join the EU, if it gave preferential treatment to US investors, as Kyiv and Brussels already have a strategic partnership on raw materials. 
But the deal's text says that the US acknowledges Ukraine's intention to join the EU and the need for this agreement not to conflict with that.
It also says that if Ukraine needs to revisit the terms of the deal because of ""additional obligations"" as part of joining the EU, then the US agrees to negotiate in good faith. 
Additionally, Kyiv says the US will support additional transfers of investment and technology in Ukraine, including from the EU and elsewhere.
The US has framed the deal as an essential one to sign if Ukraine is to continue to receive its military assistance.
Ukrainian First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko - who flew to Washington DC to sign the deal - said it envisaged the US contributing new assistance in the future, such as air defence systems.
How much has US given to Ukraine?
This, too, would mark a change in strategy for Trump - who has sought to wind down military support for Ukraine since returning to the White House.
One outstanding question is what the accord will ultimately mean for the state of the war. The Kremlin has not yet responded to the agreement.
It appears there are no concrete security guarantees from the US, which is something Ukraine and Europe have long been pushing the White House to provide.
Trump has long been reluctant to give the same military commitment that Biden had given.
Instead, his interest in staying the course with US support for Ukraine is more implicit, due to the economic commitments set out in this deal.
That means there would still be a fragility about the commitment of Ukraine's most important ally.
One intriguing point highlighted by Ukraine's government is that for the first decade of the reconstruction investment fund, profits will be ""fully reinvested in Ukraine's economy"", either in new projects or reconstruction.
This could be potentially significant if there is no financial benefit for the US for 10 years.  
However, this provision does not appear to be in the agreement signed in Washington, although it might later be part of an additional ""technical"" deal.  Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on social media that ""these terms will be subject to further discussion"".
After that initial 10-year period, Kyiv says profits may be distributed between the partners.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News late on Wednesday that the deal was a signal to the American people that ""we have a chance to participate, get some of the funding and the weapons, compensation for those and be partners with the success of the Ukraine people"". 
Speaking at the White House on Thursday, Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller described the deal as ""repayment"" to the US for the  ""hundreds of billions of dollars that our taxpayers suspect subsidised the war""."

A 16-year-old weightlifter from South Yorkshire is getting ready to hit the world stage as she represents Team GB Youth at the Youth World Championships in Peru.
Annie, from Doncaster, has already flown out to Lima, the South American country's capital, in preparation for the contest which is run by the International Weightlifting Federation.
The teenager began weightlifting when she was just 11 years old and she is now about to face her biggest sporting challenge so far.
Annie said that while she ""didn't really expect to come this far"", she was ""really excited now"" ahead of the start of the competition.
Annie says working in the gym helps her keep focused on her A-level studies
Speaking before the journey to Lima, Annie said she had been training four times a week, with each session lasting three hours.
She said that at the same time as her weightlifting preparations, she was also getting ready to take her A-Levels.
""School gives me time off when I have my free periods so I can come and train, which is good,"" she said.
Annie explained that as a college student, her day revolved around training, resting and revising.
""I wake up in the morning, do my squats, go to school and then train, come home and eat my dinner.""
She said that her schedule leading up to any competition was very tight, but she believed being at the gym actually helped her with her studies. 
""It just makes your brain really quiet. You can concentrate on something and not think about anything else,"" she said.
Weightlifter Annie, 16, gets ready for the world stage
At the Youth World Championships 2025, Annie will compete against young weightlifters from 19 other countries in her 59kg weight category.
She said she would be expected to demonstrate two types of lifts: one known as ""the snatch"" and other being ""the clean and jerk"".
Every athlete would get three attempts at each lift.
The snatch is a single-motion lift where the barbell is lifted overhead from the floor, while the clean and jerk involves two phases.
One phase sees the barbell brought to the shoulders, while the other sees it lifted overhead. 
""I did my last competition in December when I snatched 72kg and clean and jerked 91kg"", Annie explained.
Luke Stopford has been coaching Annie since she first started weightlifting aged 11
Luke Stopford, Annie's coach at the Yorkshire Strength gym in Castleford, explained that competitors must ""fully immerse"" themselves if they wanted to succeed.
""The competition is very high, especially in the females across the world. You have to show full commitment,"" he said.
""It takes a very high level of commitment, especially nowadays. It's very competitive. It's a very, very hard sport - and an unforgiving sport as well.""
Mr Stopford has coached Annie since she first picked up a barbell when she was 11.
Lima in Peru will be the backdrop for the Youth World Championships 2025
Mr Stopford, who has himself been coaching since he was 16, said he was ""proud"" to have watched Annie grow as a weightlifter. 
""She progressed really quickly, enjoyed it and committed to it straight away. She just took to it like a duck takes to water,"" he said.
With the competition in Lima due to get under way on 30 April, the 16-year-old said she was now just looking forward to taking part.
""Hopefully, I'll have a good comp,"" she said.
""I'm really excited, especially because it's not somewhere you get to go every day.
""I just want to have a good time and meet new people.""

The authorities  in the Democratic Republic of Congo are seeking to lift former President Joseph Kabila's immunity from prosecution after accusing him of backing rebels in the east.
There was a ""substantial body of documents, testimony and material facts"" linking Kabila to the M23 armed group, Justice Minister Constant Mutamba said on Wednesday.
The M23 currently controls parts of the mineral-rich east of the country after making significant advances earlier this year.
Kabila, 53, has not commented on the accusations but has in the past denied any connection with the insurgents.
He led DR Congo for 18 years, after succeeding his father Laurent, who was shot dead in 2001. Joseph Kabila was just 29 at the time.
After stepping down, he was given the title of ""senator for life"", which gives him legal immunity.
In order to pursue a legal case, DR Congo's military prosecutor has asked the senate to overturn this.
Kabila has been living outside the country, in South Africa, for the past two years. But at the beginning of last month he said he would be returning to help find a solution to the conflict in the east.
A few weeks later, there were reports that the former president had come back and was in Goma, one of the cities captured by the M23. 
But these were denied by his political party, the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD).
Last month, the authorities banned the PPRD because of its ""ambiguous attitude"" to the occupation of Congolese territory by the M23.
Justice Minister Mutamba, who last month ordered the seizure of Kabila's assets, said the former president should return to the country and ""face justice... and present his defence"".
DR Congo and Rwanda, which denies accusations it backs the M23, may be edging towards a peace deal to end the fighting, which has seen hundreds of thousands of civilians forced from their homes in recent months.
The two countries signed a preliminary agreement in Washington last week and said they would have a draft deal by Friday.

After being sworn in as president following his father's death, Kabila twice won elections. His second and final elected term in office officially ended in December 2016, but he refused to step down, saying it wasn't possible to organise elections, leading to deadly protests.
He stayed in power for two more years until elections were finally held in 2018.
In January 2019, he handed power to FÃ©lix Tshisekedi, the official winner of a disputed election, which many election observers said was rightfully won by Martin Fayulu.
He accused Kabila and Tshisekedi of agreeing a deal to exclude him from power - something both men have denied.
But relations between the pair worsened and their parties' coalition was formally ended in December 2020. 
Kabila left DR Congo in 2023, officially to study in South Africa.
In January 2024, his doctoral thesis on the geopolitics of African relations with the US, China and Russia was validated at the University of Johannesburg.

The world's oldest person, Brazilian nun Sister Inah Canabarro Lucas, has died at the age of 116.  
Born on 8 June 1908 in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, Inah Canabarro Lucas became a Catholic nun in her early 20s.
Her family said she always celebrated her birthday with a cake in the shape of the stadium of her beloved Sport Club Internacional - Porto Alegre's football team.
Sister Inah, who was blessed by Pope Francis in 2018, put her longevity down to her faith, saying that ""he [God] is the secret to life"". The title of the oldest living person will now pass to 115-year-old Ethel Caterham from Surrey in England. 
Sister Inah's nephew said the 116-year-old had not had any illness but her body ""had gradually stopped"" working. She died in the city of Porto Alegre at a home belonging to the Teresian Sisters, the religious community she was part of.
A keen football fan, she had celebrated her 116th birthday wearing the scarf of her favourite team.
She also owned several Internacional shirts and even had a collection of pillows adorned with the team's logo, according to media reports.
Sport Club Internacional posted a message of condolence on X, external, saying it had learned ""with enormous sadness of her passing"" and celebrated her life, which it said was based on kindness, faith and love of the football club.
Sister Rita Fernandes Barbosa, a co-ordinator at the religious home where Sister Inah lived, told RBS TV that the 116-year-old had enjoyed good health for most of her life.
Sister Rita said the nun had not had any surgeries until she underwent a cataract operation aged 106.
Her family said that she could not hear or see very well towards the end of her life but that she enjoyed sticking to a routine.
""She liked to get up, eat, and pray and sleep at the same time each day,"" her relatives told Brazilian TV.
A fellow Teresian nun said that Sister Inah ""never complained"".
""She is very grateful, and good-humoured,"" Sister Terezinha Aragon told Brazilian TV in January, when Sister Inah became the world's oldest person after the death of the previous holder of the title, Japanese woman Tomiko Itooka at the age of 116.
Born on 8 June 1908, Sister Inah had a religious vocation from early on in her life, joining a religious boarding school at the age of 16. 
She lived in the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo, for some time before taking her vows but returned to Brazil in 1930, where she taught Portuguese and maths at a school in Rio.
Sister Rita put the 116-year-old's longevity down to discipline. 
""Discipline in her work and in her life, she always worked a lot and was always very sociable and welcoming."""

Shortly after the shooting, senior police commanders and detectives visited the scene and investigations are under way, police said. 
President William Ruto has ordered police to conduct a thorough investigation into the attack, adding: ""Those responsible must be held to account.""
Fellow legislators who visited the scene on Wednesday night expressed shock and outrage at the killing and called for swift investigations and justice.
Parliament Speaker Moses Wetang'ula described the MP as a ""fearless and distinguished"" legislator, calling his shooting ""devastating"".

The motive for his killing is still not clear but the soft-spoken legislator had publicly claimed some ""hired goons"" were plotting to assassinate him,  attributing the plot to local politics.
In February, he expressed concern over growing violence and unrest during public events in the Kasipul constituency in western Kenya which he represented. 
""When you hear I have been killed, Kasipul will not be the same again. But I know they won't kill me because I have the Bible in my phone and another one under my pillow,"" Were said at the time.
On Thursday, homicide detectives visited the scene with Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen saying that ""investigations have advanced"". 
Were was serving his second term in parliament as a member of the Orange Democratic Movement, led by veteran politician Raila Odinga.
In his statement, Odinga condemned the killing, saying the legislator was ""mercilessly and in cold blood, gunned down by an assassin"". 
""We have lost a gallant son of the soil!"" Odinga added. 
Odinga lost to President Ruto in the 2022 election and rejected the results due to alleged irregularities.
The former prime minister has since struck a political deal with Ruto which saw some opposition members join cabinet in what is referred as the ""broad-based government"" - which Were supported.

Her mum Liz wrote on social media site X that she was delighted by the news.
She said: ""So happy these two are engaged. Michael has been with Eilish in every part of her success and disappointments. Sport is not an easy platform for relationships but they were made for each other.""

Michael Rimmer proposed to Eilish McColgan in front of Mount Fuji
Speaking after her marathon debut on Sunday, the 34-year-old told BBC Scotland she was now entering ""the last chapter of my career"" and would be focusing on marathon running from now on.
She said: ""I'm fully committed to the next four-year cycle, particularly with the Los Angeles Olympics coming up in 2028.
""It was a really tough second half for me, with the temperatures starting to rise, but the support around the course really helped.
""Pacing is important. The elite women's field is very small, so I ran 24 miles completely solo. The mental challenge of that is quite draining too.""
McColgan has won silver and bronze medals at European level over 3,000m, 5,000m and 10,000m during a glittering career,  and won 10,000m gold and 5,000m silver at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham."

Tokaido Shinkansen trains running between Tokyo and Osaka were suspended from around 17:25 local time on Wednesday.
Services resumed at around 19:00 local time, operator Central Japan Railway Company said, according to local media.
Japan is currently in one of its busiest holiday seasons, Golden Week, which consists of four national holidays in seven days, and will see trains, airports and holiday hotspots hit their peak.
Osaka is also hosting the World Expo this year, which will see millions of foreign and domestic visitors flock to the city until it ends in October.
The snake entanglement occurred between Gifu-Hashima and Maibara stations, which suspended Tokyo-bound trains between Shin-Osaka and Nagoya, and the Osaka-bound trains between Shin-Osaka and Tokyo, according to Japanese news agency Kyodo News.
While authorities worked to get power restored, passengers reportedly gathered around staff at one station while large queues formed at ticket machines.
One frequent shinkansen traveller, who was returning to Tokyo, said it was the first time he had experienced this.
""I use the shinkansen several times a month, but this is the first time I have experienced suspensions due to a power outage,"" Satoshi Tagawa, 46, told Kyodo News.
But 26-year-old Kazutoshi Tachi, said he was ""fed up with the troubles"" to services.
""I want them to run on time,"" he added.
This is not the first time a snake has brought the shinkansen service to a halt.
In April 2024, there was a 17-minute hold-up while authorities removed a 16 inch (40.6cm) snake from the train between Nagoya and Tokyo, according to CBS News, BBC News's US partner."

Russian drones have killed at least two people and injured another five in a sustained attack on the Ukrainian city of Odesa, the regional leader has said.
Residential high-rise buildings, a supermarket and school were damaged, Oleh Kiper posted on Telegram. Russia has not yet commented on the attack. 
Later on Thursday, a Russia-appointed official said seven people had been killed in a Ukrainian drone attack in an occupied town in the southern region of Kherson. Vladimir Saldo said a crowded market had been attacked in Oleshky.
However, Ukrainian forces said they had targeted four Russian soldiers and that two had been killed.
Residential buildings were damaged in the attack, the governor said
Odesa regional head Oleh Kiper said that Russian forces had targeted the city with strike drones, damaging homes and civilian infrastructure. 
""Two people died and five others were injured as a result of the strike. Medics are providing all necessary assistance to the victims,"" he said. 
The city's Mayor Gennady Trukhanov said: ""The enemy has launched another massive attack on the city. Residential buildings and civilian infrastructure have been damaged in various areas of Odesa.""
Videos and images uploaded to social media, which the BBC has not yet verified, show explosions and damaged buildings.
Odesa, a strategically important port city on the Black Sea, has a population of around a million people. It has come under repeated attack since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 
Elsewhere in Ukraine, the mayor of Kharkiv said a drone had struck a petrol station in the city centre, and explosions were also heard in the city of Sumy.
The attack comes shortly after Ukraine signed a natural resources deal with the US, and precedes a temporary ceasefire starting 8 May
The latest attacks came as the US signed a deal with Ukraine on the joint exploitation of its energy and mineral resources.
The long-anticipated deal shows much more solidarity with Ukraine than is usual for US President Donald Trump's administration.
The two countries agreed to establish a reconstruction investment fund to spur Ukraine's economic recovery from its war with Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin this week announced a temporary ceasefire for the war in Ukraine.
The Kremlin said the ceasefire would run from the morning of 8 May until 11 May - which coincides with victory celebrations to mark the end of World War Two.
In response, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called for an immediate ceasefire lasting ""at least 30 days"".
