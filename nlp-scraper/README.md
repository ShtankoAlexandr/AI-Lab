The goal of this project is to build an NLP-enriched News Intelligence platform. News analysis is a trending and important topic. The analysts get their information from the news and the amount of available information is limitless. Having a platform that helps to detect the relevant information is definitely valuable.

The platform connects to a news data source, detects the entities, detects the topic of the article, analyses the sentiment and performs a scandal detection analysis.
